	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the application of advanced language models, particularly ChatGPT-4, in identifying and utilizing industrial symbiosis opportunities within the circular economy. It examines how the model can aid in promoting sustainable industrial practices by processing data from the MAESTRI project database, which includes various symbiotic relationships, as well as randomly selected waste codes not included in the database. The research involves structured queries related to industrial symbiosis, circular economy, waste codes and potential opportunities. By assessing the model’s accuracy in response generation, the study seeks to uncover both the capabilities and limitations of the language model in resource efficiency and waste reduction, emphasizing the need for ongoing refinement and expert oversight. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the potential of ChatGPT-4 in identifying industrial symbiosis opportunities. Data from the EU-funded MAESTRI project database, which includes existing symbiotic relationships, as well as randomly selected waste codes not included in the database, are used as the primary sources. The language model is queried with structured questions on industrial symbiosis, circular economy and specific waste codes utilizing the model’s advanced functions such as file upload. Responses are evaluated by comparing them with the MAESTRI database and official European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes. Findings: The study finds that ChatGPT-4 possesses a solid understanding of fundamental concepts related to industrial symbiosis and the circular economy. However, it encounters challenges in accurately describing EWC codes, with a notable portion of descriptions found to be incorrect. Despite these inaccuracies, the model shows potential in suggesting symbiotic opportunities, although its effectiveness is limited. Interestingly, the study reveals that the model can occasionally identify correct symbiotic relationships even with initial inaccuracies. These findings highlight the need for expert oversight and further development of the language model to improve its utility in complex, regulated fields like industrial symbiosis. Originality/value: This study’s originality lies in its exploration of advanced language models, particularly ChatGPT-4, for identifying industrial symbiosis opportunities within the circular economy framework. Unlike previous research, which primarily focuses on specific sectors and AI’s role in general resource efficiency, this study specifically examines the capabilities and limitations of the language model in handling specialized and regulated information, such as EWC codes across various sectors. It employs a novel approach by comparing AI-generated responses with an established symbiosis database, which is comprehensive and spans all sectors rather than being limited to a single industry, as well as with randomly selected waste codes not included in the database. The study contributes to understanding how AI tools can support sustainable industrial practices, emphasizing the importance of refining these models for practical applications in environmental and industrial contexts. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Agile software project management (ASPM) serves modern industries to conduct iterative development of complicated code bases. The decision-making process in Agile environments regularly depends on individual opinions, creating ineffective results for risk management and resource distribution. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising approach for handling these challenges by delivering data-based choices to project management. This research introduces an AI-based decision support system for improving risk reduction and resource distribution in ASPM. The system merges optimization frameworks and predictive analytics to enhance operational decision efficiency. The machine learning solution anchors data evaluation using AI models that simultaneously predict risks and strengthen decision power for resource scheduling. This analysis relied on project records and recent operational data to perform model validation and training procedures. Tests determined how the framework performed against contemporary Agile project management systems by measuring the completion speed of sprints, resource management practices, and risk prediction accuracy. The framework demonstrated better performance by predicting risks and simultaneously maximizing resources utilized during projects. The proposed framework outperformed traditional Agile applications, achieving 94% accuracy in risk identification and enhancing workload management by 25%, leading to an 18% improvement in sprint completion rates and overall project efficiency. These findings confirm that AI-driven decision support systems (DSSs) are crucial in enhancing Agile project management by enabling proactive risk mitigation and optimized resource allocation. By integrating AI-powered decision-making, the framework empowers organizations to improve project outcomes, streamline resource management, and facilitate the adoption of AI-driven methodologies within Agile systems. © 2025 by the author.},

As the process is normally conducted with a high level of student autonomy, there is often no way of monitoring what resources students rely on. In this context, the rapid availability of generative AI can support not only innovation, but also unfair practices. In this article, we will present case study research on the use of AI in PBL summative assessment in higher education, based on six courses. We analyzed and compared six courses of different levels of study (undergraduate, graduate, postgraduate), in different areas/subjects (mathematics, IT, project management, education). In some courses, it was obligatory to use AI, while in others it was either optional or not foreseen. We analyzed assessment results, student surveys and teacher testimonials, using mixed-method research. Based on the research cases, we identified three possible models of integrating AI in PBL and provided recommendations. Copyright © 2025 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

Design/methodology/approach: Systematically, this study compiles and analyses 36 peer-reviewed journal articles sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed. Findings: The results demonstrate deep learning, building information modelling, robotic automations, remote sensors and fuzzy logic as major key AI-based risk models (tools) for PPP infrastructures. The roles of AI in climate risk management of PPPs include risk detection, analysis, controls and prediction. Research limitations/implications: For researchers, the findings provide relevant guide for further investigations into AI and climate risks within the PPP research domain. Practical implications: This article highlights the AI tools in mitigating climate crisis in PPP infrastructure management.

	abstract = {The evolution towards sixth-generation (6G) networks requires new architecture enhancements to support the broad device ecosystem, comprising users, machines, autonomous vehicles, and Internet-of-things devices. Moreover, high heterogeneity in the desired quality-of-service (QoS) is expected, as 6G networks will offer extremely low-latency and high-throughput services and error-free communication. This complex environment raises significant challenges in resource management while adhering to security and privacy constraints due to the plethora of data generation endpoints. Considering the advances in AI/ML-aided integration in wireless networks and recent efforts on the network data analytics function (NWDAF) by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), this work presents an AI/ML-aided distributed trustable engine (DTE), collecting data from diverse sources of the 6G infrastructure and deploying ML methods for anomaly detection against diverse threat types. Moreover, we present the DTE architecture and its components, providing data management, AI/ML model training, and classification capabilities for anomaly detection. To promote privacy-aware networking, a federated learning (FL) framework to extend the DTE is discussed. Then, the anomaly detection capabilities of the AI/ML-aided DTE are presented in detail, together with the ML model training process, which considers various ML models. For this purpose, we use two open datasets representing attack scenarios in the core and the edge parts of the network. Experimental results, including an ensemble learning method and different supervised learning alternatives, show that the AI/ML-aided DTE can efficiently train ML models with reduced dimensionality and deploy them in diverse cybersecurity scenarios to improve anomaly detection in 6G networks. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The agricultural sector performs an indispensable role in universal sustenance and financial advancement. Still, diverse diseases, comprising those triggered by disease-causing agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, usually threaten the robustness and proficiency of crops. Precocious detection and accurate prognosis of these infections are necessary for efficient disease supervision and governance strategies. In this framework, advanced methods and deep learning strategies, such as the VGG19 structure, provide optimistic resolutions for AI-driven disease identification in vegetation. VGG19, a continuation of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) clan, utilizes transfer learning to attain high accuracy in feature exclusion and image classification projects. By capitalizing on its proficiencies, remarkably in spotting evidence like mottled leaves, leaf disfigurement, retarded growth, leaf curving, and leaf tarnishing, VGG19 illustrates a consequential perspective in determining diseases such as mosaic and curl pathogens. These infections, transferred by means of bug vectors and infected plant substances, impose substantial threats to crop wellness. This research paper targets to investigate the program of VGG19 in discerning mosaic and curl pathogens in vegetation, with a target on augmenting accuracy and effectiveness contrasted to conventional recognition approaches. By harnessing the control of deep learning and image taxonomy, this study pursues the advancement of robust disease-supervising approaches, guaranteeing the well-being and efficiency of agricultural and planting vegetation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {The University of Naples Federico II, recognizing the need to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of its academic services, initiated a strategic plan to modernize its infrastructure. The increasing demands of a large academic community, involving nearly 100,000 students and staff, revealed critical bottlenecks in managing exam reservations, data synchronization, and scalability. A thorough analysis identified the need for tools capable of ensuring efficient resource management, real-time data synchronization, and the flexibility to adapt to evolving requirements. Following an extensive market analysis, Terraform [3] and Oracle GoldenGate were selected as the most suitable tools to address these challenges. Terraform, with its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities, simplifies cloud resource provisioning and enables scalable and consistent configurations. Meanwhile, Oracle GoldenGate facilitates seamless, low-latency synchronization between on-premises and cloud systems, addressing critical data replication needs. Currently, comprehensive tests are underway to compare the performance of the upgraded infrastructure against the previous system, focusing on response times and workload efficiency. Early results demonstrate significant improvements in operational efficiency and scalability. Looking forward, the university envisions integrating AI-driven analytics to further enhance academic services and identify emerging needs. This project represents a critical milestone in creating a resilient, scalable, and modern infrastructure that aligns with the evolving demands of the academic community. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and hybrid approaches are increasingly relevant in Decision Science at both the scientific and industrial application levels. While symbolic approaches enjoy well-established techniques to verify their behaviour, data-driven or hybrid approaches can pose a risk in terms of robustness under uncertain conditions, and their behaviour can be less predictable and explainable in unexpected conditions. To address this challenge, the European Commission presented in 2019 the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [1], and included in the Horizon Europe 2020–2024 programme a financing of 96 million euros for Trustworthy, Human Centred and Responsible AI. Amongst other initiatives, the TUPLES project [2] was initiated to develop the foundations, approaches and tools needed to achieve transparent, robust, and safe algorithmic solutions in Planning and scheduling (P&S), and increase confidence in these systems to accelerate their adoption. TUPLES is planned to release a toolkit including a set of simulation environments, a self-assessment tool to validate the confidence level of a P&S application, and will launch a competition in late 2024 to engage a wider audience and increase its impact [3]. We outline the challenges, approaches and objectives of the project, focusing on the use cases provided by OPTIT in the application sectors of Energy [4] and Waste management [5]. In doing so, we provide a concrete perspective on how Human Centred AI (with a specific focus on robustness and explainability) requires innovative strategies and approaches that will pave the way for significant improvements in the Decision Support Systems of the coming decades. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

Microservice architectures have become popular in the industry, having a high amount of material available that was used in the training of large language models (LLMs). This paper explores the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, guided by a prompt pattern sequence to support architectural decision-making in microservices architectures. The proposed approach aims to provide structured guidance to software architects, helping them navigate in complex design challenges. To evaluate the prompt sequence, we conducted studies that revisited important architectural decisions made by large companies in the context of microservices architectures. Two industry case studies are presented: one involving the management of a large set of components in a financial institution, and the other focused on the front-end approach for a large-scale e-commerce platform in a pharmaceutical chain. The results demonstrate how five distinct prompt patterns deliver actionable insights tailored to each project’s unique technical and business constraints, enabling more informed decision-making. Retrospective feedback from architects highlights the effectiveness of the proposed prompt pattern sequence, which proposed solutions aligned to what was actually implemented. The findings suggest that generative AI, guided by well-structured prompt patterns, can support the decision-making process in microservice architectures. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2025.},

The choices taken throughout a project’s planning and implementation phases can have a lasting effect on its economic and environmental performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have proven to be capable of managing challenging, erratic, and dynamic tasks. Project delays are the primary problem that the construction industry faces because of the inherent complexity and unpredictability of the work involved in building. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider these factors and make decisions that are consistent with the goals of sustainable development. Economic criteria and sustainable development can be balanced and optimized by using a hybrid artificial intelligence model known as an SVM classifier with genetic algorithm optimization, which forecasts project delays in construction project scheduling. Statistical performance measure indices are used to validate the suggested SVM-GA against the traditional SVM model. All things considered, the suggested methodology demonstrated a strong and trustworthy method for project delay prediction that supports sustainability and monitoring of construction project management. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Prof. (Dr.) Dorota Jelonek, Prof. (Dr.) Narendra Kumar, Prof. (Dr.) Mamta Chahar, Prof. (Dr.) Rusudan Kinkladze and Prof. (Dr.) Lilla Knop; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {An optimized scheduling system for surgical procedures is considered fundamental for maximizing hospital resource utilization and improving patient outcomes. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and New Technologies is paramount in this project to enable personalized patient care and optimize perioperative clinical pathways. We read with interest the manuscript by Parks et al., which developed a predictive model of surgical case durations. The model appears to adopt a pragmatic approach by analyzing tangible variables and undergoing validation across various types of surgical procedures, which suggests potential avenues for enhancing efficiency and sustainability in healthcare practices. However, we have some observations, particularly regarding the feasibility and practical implementation of the proposed model. A key limitation of the model is the precise definition of surgical duration, which requires further specification. To effectively translate the model into a practical scheduling approach, it is essential to consider total Operating Room (OR) occupancy time as a critical determinant of surgical planning and resource allocation. This includes not only the actual procedural time but also preoperative preparation, anesthesia induction and recovery, cleaning, and material restocking, all of which significantly impact overall scheduling efficiency. Another critical aspect concerns the quality and reliability of the input data, which is fundamental for ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, the adoption of new technologies should be regarded not merely as an innovation but as a means to develop high-performance, efficient tools that enhance current clinical practice. In this context, machine learning models should not only serve as analytical instruments but also as actionable tools, enabling the transition from predictive insights to strategic planning and optimized scheduling, ultimately improving decision-making and resource allocation. While making accurate predictions is a good starting point, maintaining an active AI model requires investment in resources, such as an increase in the number of surgical cases compared to the current organizational system. It may be beneficial to consider the creation of a multidisciplinary group that could promote the integration of AI with other emerging technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {In today’s digital age, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems is essential for businesses to streamline workflows and boost efficiency. The Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation depends on manual processes to screen project proposals, leading to significant delays and transparency issues. An automated AI-based system, particularly one that employs natural language processing with Hugging Face transformers, is proposed to mitigate these challenges. This system has been demonstrated to reduce screening time by 70.21% while achieving a content accuracy of 91.8%, marking a substantial improvement in efficiency. However, its limitation lies in not providing automatic scoring for proposals based on predefined criteria, a feature that could minimize human involvement further. By extracting relevant information and presenting condensed concept notes, the system streamlines the decision-making process, significantly reducing the resources required for project proposals screening. This advancement is particularly impactful for Bhutan, a country with a rich ecosystem and a focus on donor agencies such as the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Implementing a reliable AI system addresses the concerns of donor agencies and supports their priority of enhancing efficiency and transparency. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {The construction industry is central to the advancement of economic growth all over the world but it has various problems in risk management especially concerning sustainable construction projects. Standard risk management techniques like AHP and Monte Carlo simulation do not afford the flexibility and accuracy needed in construction sites. Based on the identified limitations, this study offers a new system of risk assessment that combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Real-time IoT sensor data and historical project data are integrated into a real-time and adaptive system which can identify, suggest, and minimize potential risks for improved decision making. The ANN component is distinctive in pattern recognition and risk prediction while Fuzzy Logic brings ease of interpretation and reasoning in the uncertain environment. Raw IoT data are live data which may be processed and updated frequently relative to the devices and their environment. The effectiveness of this framework can be ascertained through experimental proof; the framework’s accuracy is 92.7%; project delay and cost have been minimized. The results reveal that the presented framework is highly resistant to noise, and its performance changes fairly slowly if the project requirements change. This integrative approach ensures the identification of the comprehensive solution for the sustainable construction risk management, which may help with the development of the safer, more efficient and non-harmful to the environment construction techniques. © 2025 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications},

Guided by the dynamic capabilities framework, this study investigated how AI assimilation affects environmental performance, with organizational agility serving as a mediating factor in construction organizations. A moderated mediation analysis was employed in this study to investigate the contingent effect of strategic flexibility in altering the connection between agility and environmental performance. Data were gathered from 308 project managers. The findings of structural equation modeling validated the arguments that AI assimilation increases organizational agility and that this translates to increased environmental performance. Furthermore, strategic flexibility moderates the direct relationship between agility and environmental performance, as well as the indirect relationship between AI assimilation and environmental performance via organizational agility, emphasizing the significance of aligning agile responses with the strategic objectives of the business. The relevance of this research to the field of construction engineering management is that it leads to the integration of AI, improving the environmental performance of the firm through organizational agility. This study shows the moderating function of strategic flexibility in the interrelation between agility and environmental performance. These consequences are aimed primarily at the construction project management sector and policymakers because they emphasize the importance of agile methods of progress of projects to serve the strategic objectives the success of which is vital for environmental sustainability. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {This chapter delves into Boston’s pioneering journey towards becoming a beacon of urban sustainability, showcasing its commitment to the principles of connection, cooling, and absorption through smart city innovations. Boston stands as a testament to how cities can harmonize technology with sustainability, transforming challenges into opportunities for resilience and community well-being. The narrative begins with Boston’s strategic blueprint to enhance urban connectivity. By expanding pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, the city fosters a more inclusive and sustainable transportation network. Real-life examples include the Emerald Necklace—a revitalized greenway that links parks through a series of paths and waterways, encouraging eco-friendly transit and reconnecting communities with their natural surroundings. In tackling the urban heat island effect, Boston turns to innovative cooling strategies. The deployment of reflective roofing materials across city buildings and the introduction of urban green spaces, like the Rose Kennedy Greenway, not only reduce surface temperatures but also offer serene retreats for residents and biodiversity alike. These initiatives are supported by IoT-enabled environmental monitoring systems, which provide valuable data to guide urban planning and emergency response. The concept of absorption is brought to life through Boston’s approach to managing excess stormwater and enhancing coastal resilience. The city’s implementation of permeable pavements, rain gardens, and expanded wetlands exemplifies how integrating natural elements into urban design can mitigate flooding risks while beautifying neighborhoods. Projects such as the redesign of Moakley Park exemplify this approach by creating a flood-resilient landscape that absorbs storm surges, protecting the community and its infrastructure. Underpinning these efforts is the strategic use of AI and IoT technologies. AI-driven analytical tools predict potential flood zones and heat hotspots, enabling preemptive action. Meanwhile, IoT sensors embedded in the urban fabric collect real-time data on environmental conditions, facilitating adaptive and responsive city management. This chapter celebrates Boston’s dynamic strategies of connecting, cooling, and absorbing, illustrating the city’s commitment to not just adapting to the challenges posed by climate change but also thriving in spite of them. By weaving together technology, sustainability, and community engagement, Boston exemplifies a future where urban environments are resilient, livable, and harmoniously integrated with nature. © 2025, Bentham Books imprint.},

	abstract = {Goal: Efficient patient flow is critical at Tampa General Hospital (TGH), a large academic tertiary care center and safety net hospital with more than 50,000 discharges and 30,000 surgical procedures per year. TGH collaborated with GE HealthCare Command Center to build a command center (called CareComm) with real-time artificial intelligence (AI) applications, known as tiles, to dynamically streamline patient care operations and throughput. To facilitate patient flow for our neuroscience service line, we partnered with the GE HealthCare Command Center team to configure a Downgrade Readiness Tile (DRT) to expedite patient transfers out of the neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU) and reduce their length of stay (LOS). Methods: As part of an integrated NSICU performance improvement project, our LOS reduction workgroup identified the admission/discharge and transfer process as key metrics. Based on a 90%-plus average capacity, early identification of patients eligible for a downgrade to lower acuity units is critical to maintain flow from the operating rooms and emergency department. Our group identified clinical factors consistent with downgrade readiness as well as barriers preventing transition to the next phase of care. Configuration of an AI-powered model was identified as a mechanism to drive earlier downgrade and reduce LOS in the NSICU. A multidisciplinary ICU LOS reduction steering committee met to determine the criteria, design, and implementation of the AI-powered DRT. As opposed to identifying traditional clinical factors associated with stability for transfer, our working group asked, “What are clinical barriers preventing downgrade?” We identified more than 76 clinical elements from the electronic medical records that are programmed and displayed in real-time with a desired accuracy of over 95%. If no criteria are present, and no bed is requested or assigned, the DRT will report potential readiness for transfer. If three or more criteria are present, the DRT will suggest that the patient is not eligible for transfer. Principal Findings: The DRT was implemented in January 2022 and is used during multidisciplinary rounds (MDRs) and displayed on monitors positioned throughout the NSICU. During MDRs, the bedside nurses present each patient’s key information in a standardized manner, after which the DRT is used to recommend or oppose patient transfer. Six months postimplementation period of the DRT and MDRs, the NSICU has seen a 7% or roughly eight-hour reduction in the ICU length of stay (4.15–3.88 days) with a more than three-hour earlier placement of a transfer order. Unplanned returns to the ICU (or bouncebacks) have remained low with no change in the preimplementation rate of 3% within 24 hours. As a result of this success, DRTs are being implemented in the medical ICUs. Practical Applications: This work is uniquely innovative as it shows AI can be integrated into traditional interdisciplinary rounds and enable accelerated decision-making, continuous monitoring, and real-time alerts. ICU throughput has traditionally relied on direct review of a patient’s clinical course executed during clinical rounds. Our methodology adds a dynamic and technologically augmented touchpoint that is available in real time and can prompt a transfer request at any time throughout the day. © 2025 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives.},

Indeed, while Kahneman himself is no longer with us, his ideas continue to carry enormous weight in the project management field. This essay is offered as a festschrift and is accompanied by invited commentaries. We take stock of Kahneman's work on judgment and decision-making under risk; bias, error and noise; and the Planning Fallacy. We note that much of his work served as a foreshadowing of current scholarship and opened wide avenues for exploration in project management; everything from topics such as project behavior, causes and effects of project performance, happiness and well-being, and even foreshadowing the AI movement. We argue that Kahneman's ideas at the intersection of psychology and economics have not so much revised as upended our understanding of project management. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In traditional medical education, learners are mostly trained to diagnose and treat patients through supervised practice. Artificial Intelligence and simulation techniques can complement such an educational practice. In this paper, we present GLARE-Edu, an innovative system in which AI knowledge-based methodologies and simulation are exploited to train learners “how to act” on patients based on the evidence-based best practices provided by clinical practice guidelines. GLARE-Edu is being developed by a multi-disciplinary team involving physicians and AI experts, within the AI-LEAP (LEArning Personalization of AI and with AI) Italian project. GLARE-Edu is domain-independent: it supports the acquisition of clinical guidelines and case studies in a computer format. Based on acquired guidelines (and case studies), it provides a series of educational facilities: (i) navigation, to navigate the structured representation of the guidelines provided by GLARE-Edu, (ii) automated simulation, to show learners how a guideline would suggest to act, step-by-step, on a specific case, and (iii) (self)verification, asking learners how they would treat a case, and comparing step-by-step the learner’s proposal with the suggestions of the proper guideline. In this paper, we describe GLARE-Edu architecture and general features, and we demonstrate our approach through a concrete application to the melanoma guideline and we propose a preliminary evaluation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to its extensive adoption in Project Risk Management (PRM), leveraging its powerful predictive capabilities and data-driven insights that support proactive decision-making. Nevertheless, the “black-box” nature of ML models obscures the reasoning behind predictions, undermining transparency and trust. To address this, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Global Priors-based LIME (G-LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have been applied to interpret black-box models. Yet, they face considerable limitations in PRM, including their inability to model cascading effects and multi-level dependencies among risk factors, suffering from inconsistencies due to random sampling, and failure to capture non-linear interactions in high-dimensional risk data. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes the Multi-Module eXplainable Artificial Intelligence framework for Project Risk Management (MMXAI-PRM), a novel approach designed to address the unique demands of PRM. The framework consists of three modules: the Risk Relationship Insight Module (RRIM), which models risk dependencies using a Knowledge Graph (KG); the Risk Factor Influence Analysis Module (RFIAM), which introduces a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-aided Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations using Kernel Ridge Regression (CTGAN-LIME-KR) to ensure explanation consistency and handle non-linearity; and the Visualization and Interpretation Module (VIM), which synthesizes these insights into an interpretable, chain-based representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMXAI-PRM delivers more consistent, stable, and accurate explanations than existing XAI methods. By improving interpretability, it enhances trust in AI-driven risk predictions and equips project managers with actionable insights, advancing decision-making in PRM. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study aims to provide insights to support organizations in building effective strategies for adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) and improving project management processes. It focuses on open innovation projects. It employs a comprehensive and systematic literature review (SLR). A total of 365 publications have been chosen from a pool of 1265 papers in the IEEE and Scopus databases. The study develops a framework for literature synthesis guided by five research questions. Those questions address AI technologies, project management tasks, industries adopting AI, and requirements for successful adoption. The analysis reveals that Machine Learning is widely employed in project management, especially for predicting analytics, optimizing resources, and managing risks. AI improves open innovation project management by integrating diverse knowledge sources, enhancing collaboration, and providing strategic insights for decision-making. This study also found that AI adoption depends not only on technical infrastructure, integration with existing systems, and data readiness but also on leadership support, strategic alignment, financial resources, skills development, and organizational culture. The findings also highlight the importance of aligning AI initiatives with open innovation requirements, where collaboration, agility, and external knowledge integrations are crucial. The construction sector is at the forefront of adopting AI. This study fills a significant gap in previous research by identifying the technical and non-technical prerequisites for effectively incorporating AI into open innovation project management methodologies. © 2024 The Authors},

Consistent with the objectives of the CHANGES project—Cultural Heritage Active Innovation for Sustainable Society, which focuses on the enhancement and management of cultural heritage through a multidisciplinary and interinstitutional approach—this strategy employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate symbol classification. A CNN model was developed using an extensive dataset comprising over 6000 symbols, implementing meticulous preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning protocols. The methodological pipeline incorporates advanced image segmentation techniques to isolate symbols from complex manuscripts, followed by data augmentation to enhance model resilience. The system is supported by a high-performance computing framework to manage large datasets efficiently, thereby facilitating more precise identification and analysis. This integration of machine learning techniques, exhaustive data management, and computational capabilities significantly advances existing symbol recognition methodologies, providing scholars with a potent tool for assisting in the classification and interpretation of historical symbols. The findings corroborate the potential of AI-enhanced symbol recognition in contributing to the broader objectives of computational library science and historical research. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To learn Agile/DevOps practices effectively, students need to apply them in an actual software development project. This is challenging if students are mostly from non-computing backgrounds and they do not have time in the curriculum to learn programming and related tools. Therefore, it is important to help students who do not possess programming foundations to develop fully functional software during the process of learning Agile/DevOps concepts. We noted that existing low-code/no-code app development platforms have not been designed to teach Agile/DevOps practices. On the other hand, recent AI-based tools for code generation such as GitHub Copilot have been built mainly for programmers. In this work, we designed and implemented ADA-Gen (Agile/DevOps App Generator), a teaching tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate full-stack web apps following an iterative and incremental development methodology widely practiced in Agile/DevOps circles. ADA-Gen is integrated with Jira, one of the most popular platforms for software project management, so students can use it right away without much further setup. This approach allows non-computing students to experience the complete full-stack software development life cycle. We have conducted extensive evaluations of ADA-Gen using various realistic project scenarios. The evaluations demonstrated the capabilities of ADA-Gen in full-stack web app generation, and in providing plenty of learning opportunities for students to appreciate key Agile/DevOps practices.

	abstract = {High costs, technical difficulties, and policy uncertainties are the main challenges in carbon capture technology investments. Therefore, innovative financial products are required to develop projects that overcome these difficulties. Some issues must be considered when developing innovative financial products. An important problem in this process is that these features cannot possibly exist together in the new financial product, because each of these features incurs some costs. Therefore, identifying the most important features of innovative financial products is necessary. Accordingly, this study develops a new and innovative financial product to increase the effectiveness of investments in carbon capture technologies. For this purpose, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based fuzzy decision-making model is constructed. First, the weights of the experts were calculated by considering AI methodology. Second, the factors affecting investment in carbon capture technologies were weighted using a spherical fuzzy DEMATEL. Finally, the financial features required for investments were ranked using the spherical fuzzy ARAS method. This study’s main contribution is its creation of a novel fuzzy decision-making model by integrating AI methodology with fuzzy decision-making theory. In this process, the weights of the experts are calculated using an AI approach. It is concluded that cost-effectiveness must be prioritized in the development of new financial products. Technological competence is another aspect that should be considered in this process. However, innovative financial products should include risk management and flexible financing. © The Author(s) 2025.},

Predictive analytics for insurance entails the use of special technology to sift through and analyze historical telematics data and consumer trends in effort to project future behavior. Obviously combining the AI based IT technologies with mathematical and statistical models, the integrated digitalized platform presented in this article involve also both Data Modeling and Deep Learning. Practically, the software platform presented in this article represents the backbone of any insurance brokerage business, because without such an application it is impossible to manage business processes that have hundreds or even thousands of sales agents. From structural point of view, this platform has a layered structure, the first layer being the basic brokerage application, this being extended with innovative predictive computational modules as upper layers. The technical implications mainly refers to the innovative way of involving in the digitalized system a massive amount of telematics data. The expected business implications consists in offering, by an innovative digitalized solution, the possibility for the final client (insurance broker or insurer) to receive information that will help him make a forecast of business. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2025.},

	abstract = {The CompSafeNano project, a Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) project funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, aims to advance the safety and innovation potential of nanomaterials (NMs) by integrating cutting-edge nanoinformatics, computational modelling, and predictive toxicology to enable design of safer NMs at the earliest stage of materials development. The project leverages Safe-by-Design (SbD) principles to ensure the development of inherently safer NMs, enhancing both regulatory compliance and international collaboration. By building on established nanoinformatics frameworks, such as those developed in the H2020-funded projects NanoSolveIT and NanoCommons, CompSafeNano addresses critical challenges in nanosafety through development and integration of innovative methodologies, including advanced in vitro models, in silico approaches including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive models and 1st-principles computational modelling of NMs properties, interactions and effects on living systems. Significant progress has been made in generating atomistic and quantum-mechanical descriptors for various NMs, evaluating their interactions with biological systems (from small molecules or metabolites, to proteins, cells, organisms, animals, humans and ecosystems), and in developing predictive models for NMs risk assessment. The CompSafeNano project has also focused on implementing and further standardising data reporting templates and enhancing data management practices, ensuring adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Despite challenges, such as limited regulatory acceptance of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) currently, which has implications for predictive nanosafety assessment, CompSafeNano has successfully developed tools and models that are integral to the safety evaluation of NMs, and that enable the extensive datasets on NMs safety to be utilised for the re-design of NMs that are inherently safer, including through prediction of the acquired biomolecule coronas which provide the biological or environmental identities to NMs, promoting their sustainable use in diverse applications. Future efforts will concentrate on further refining these models, expanding the NanoPharos Database, and working with regulatory stakeholders thereby fostering the widespread adoption of SbD practices across the nanotechnology sector. CompSafeNano's integrative approach, multidisciplinary collaboration and extensive stakeholder engagement, position the project as a critical driver of innovation in NMs SbD methodologies and in the development and implementation of computational nanosafety. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Irrigation system optimization is of utmost importance for sustainable agriculture in light of the growing worldwide water shortage caused by climate change and rising agricultural needs. In order to improve water management techniques and decrease agricultural resource use, this project investigates the use of AI and predictive analytics. An intelligent irrigation system that adapts water distribution in real-time according to predictive analytics is created in this study by combining state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with real-time data from a variety of sources, such as weather predictions, soil moisture levels, and crop water needs. In order to reduce water waste and maximize irrigation efficiency, the suggested framework uses past data to train artificial intelligence models. Results from field studies on a variety of crops show that water efficiency has been improved, allowing for 30% reductions in irrigation water use without sacrificing or diminishing crop yields. Sustainable farming practices and better resource management are two additional benefits that farmers reap from using AI-driven insights to inform their decision-making. This research emphasizes the revolutionary power of AI to update irrigation methods, leading to more robust agricultural systems. This study highlights the significance of data-driven methods to water management in achieving food security and environmental sustainability through the integration of technology and agriculture. If we want to see optimal irrigation practices adopted all throughout the world, our next step is to improve the predictive models and make the framework function in more diverse agricultural settings.  © 2025 IEEE.},

This ongoing research investigates the application of transfer learning for traffic state prediction in small and medium-sized cities. Preliminary tests in Greater Manchester and Lisbon under the TANGENT H2020 project have shown promising results.

The use of expert opinion and qualitative methodologies in traditional risk identification makes them vulnerable to subjectivity and responsiveness, leading to cost overruns, delays, and, ultimately, project failure. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of risk identification, this study utilises historical data in conjunction with AI approaches to develop a data-driven risk identification model. The model determines risk frequency and consequence by matching them to different risk categories in previous projects, considering word semantics. This model also demonstrates the facilitation of proactive decision-making and allows infrastructure project team members to identify risks early and implement mitigation plans.

The work systematically progresses from requirement analysis and standard development to the deployment of tools for monitoring and enhancing data quality in big data workflows. The study's contributions are substantiated through five research questions that explore the impact of data quality on analytics, the establishment of evaluation standards, centralized management strategies, improvement techniques, and education-specific BDQM adaptations. By addressing these questions, the research advances both theoretical and practical frameworks, equipping stakeholders with the tools to enhance the reliability and efficiency of data-driven educational initiatives. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and distributed computing, this research introduces a novel multi-stage BDQM framework that emphasizes data quality assessment, centralized governance, and AI-enhanced improvement techniques. This work underscores the transformative potential of robust BDQM systems in supporting informed decision-making and achieving sustainable outcomes in educational projects. The survey findings highlight the potential for automated data management within big data architectures, suggesting that data quality frameworks can be significantly enhanced by leveraging AI and distributed computing.

Eleven features, including environmental, topographical, soil, and hydrological properties, were utilized to identify physical similarities for watershed clustering. Machine learning techniques, including random forest and hierarchical clustering, were employed to transfer calibrated parameters from gauged to ungauged watersheds. Validation of parameter transfer over gauged SWAT model projects showed that 88% of the projects achieved calibrated status (KGE ≥0.5; PBIAS ≤25%). Additional validation using MODIS satellite evapotranspiration measurements confirmed the robustness of the approach. Results indicated that the proposed approach successfully captures physical similarities, and effectively captures flow patterns.

Developing AI-based systems means facing new challenges, not known for more conventional systems. Such challenges need to be identified and addressed by properly adapting the existing development and management processes. [Objective] In this paper, we focus on the requirements engineering (RE) area of IT projects and aim to propose the RE process that would be able to address at least some of the reported challenges. No proposal of such process could be found in the existing literature. [Method] We conducted a literature review using a snowballing technique to identify RE-related challenges for AI-based systems. Then, we compared several RE industry guides, selected a well-established RE process and adapted it by introducing additional practices. The additional practices were proposed as result of brainstorming and ideation process. [Results] The contributions of this paper include: a list of identified challenges, a set of additional practices to mitigate challenges and a model of the adapted RE process which integrates such practices. [Conclusions] The proposed process is available for validation activities and can be used by researchers and practitioners as a base for further adaptations of RE approaches to AI solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {The combination of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) offers a potent remedy for disaster management and response systems in this age of quickly advancing technology. Using text and image data gathered from social media sites, this project, makes use of the collective intelligence present in the data. We carefully trained a bidirectional LSTM model for textual analysis and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using Kaggle datasets. Our system’s fundamental component is an API that is installed on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance. To improve performance and stability, the API is strengthened with load balancing, auto-scaling features, and multi-AZ redundancy. The API easily integrates with the trained models to determine whether the content is relevant to a disaster scenario when it receives input data. When a positive classification is made from the processed text or image, an alert mechanism sends out an email notification with important information about the disaster that was discovered. The abundance of user-generated content available on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter presents a special chance to improve the efficacy and efficiency of disaster relief operations. The main objective of this project is to use cutting-edge technologies to sort through massive amounts of social media data and derive useful insights in emergency situations. © 2025 University of Bahrain.

	abstract = {Prioritization among tasks is the most basic building block of effective project and workflow management, especially when the number of tasks is large and there are few marginal resources available. This paper presents a hybrid model implemented based on neural networks for task-priority forecasting and considering textual and numerical attributes. In particular, the model uses NL processing methodologies to process task descriptions. Auxiliary metadata-significance, projected duration, workload, and optimal working hours-are processed by special-ized numerical input layers. All parts are put together in a systematic architecture, within which the model can decide that a task is of "High"or "Normal"priority along with an appropriate score for confidence. Preprocessing of the training dataset adds multiple features to make it comprehensive, which consequently enhances the robustness and the scalability of the model. The developed model relies on the binary cross-entropy loss function evaluation in terms of accuracy on unseen data, and hence it results in a system that provides dependable predictions as an effective instrument for automated task management in dynamic settings of organizations. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: Issue labeling is a fundamental task for software development as it is critical for the effective management of software projects. This practice involves assigning a label to issues, such as bug or feature request, denoting a task relevant to the project management. To date, large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to automate this task, including both fine-tuned BERT-like models and zero-shot GPT-like models. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate which LLMs offer the best trade-off between performance, response time, hardware requirements, and quality of the responses for issue report classification. Methods: We design and execute a comprehensive benchmark study to assess 22 generative decoder-only LLMs and 2 baseline BERT-like encoder-only models, which we evaluate on two different datasets of GitHub issues. Results: Generative LLMs demonstrate potential for zero-shot classification. However, their performance varies significantly across datasets and they require substantial computational resources for deployment. In contrast, BERT-like models show more consistent performance and lower resource requirements. Conclusions: Based on the empirical evidence provided in this study, we discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. In particular, our results suggest that fine-tuning BERT-like encoder-only models enables achieving consistent, state-of-the-art performance across datasets even in presence of a small amount of labeled data available for training. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

There is inaccuracy in traditional methods which delays in detecting leaks and communication. There is also an inefficiency in resource allocation and cost management. Therefor the selected system uses sensors to gauge the critical parameters of water quality for safety and suitability for consumption, detects leaks in the network of water supply and automatically turns off the water flow in order to avoid wastage or damage. Apart from leak detection, the system gives an added dimension to environmental security by monitoring various substances present. It is also fitted with a gas detection system that has been programmed to give an alarm and shut down the water supply within an environment whenever it detects poisonous gas, in order to prevent contamination and possible risk to the environment. These can all prove to have real-time data, which would allow users to keep a watch on the quality of the water, leakage detection, and assessing safety in the environment. Using IoT technology, this system ensures that it gives the user access to remote locations using the internet. Automated critical operations, fast response times, and resource conservation make this facility well suited for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. It is always a cost-saving solution to ensure that water quality is maintained, minimum leakage is kept, and safety is maximized, thus ensuring a modern power management.  © 2025 IEEE.},

This wave of innovation is reshaping the entire landscape and holds the promise of streamlining the development process, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. By providing text prompts, developers can now receive entirely generated code outputs, representing a fundamental shift in how software is built. This paradigm change can accelerate development cycles and unlock new levels of creativity and ingenuity, resulting in the realization of novel applications and business outcomes. However, this paradigm shift also brings new challenges and necessitates acquiring additional skills for software developers to fully harness the capabilities of LLM-powered tools. These skills include prompt engineering for software development, structural complexity management, debugging of AI errors, and compliance with ethical guidelines and principles. The special session will introduce our NSF-sponsored 3-year project, which aims to integrate LLMs into the standard CS curriculum. To the best of our knowledge, this project is among the first department-level initiatives to renovate CS curriculum, rather than individual courses, with the new developments of LLMs. Our project focuses on (a) enhancing students' problem-solving and programming skills by leveraging LLMs as a learning tool in core programming courses, (b) improving students' software development skills by integrating LLM-powered tools into the software engineering course sequence, and (c) educating students on ethical and responsible AI practices.

	abstract = {Background: Perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD) is a prevalent congenital heart disease, presenting challenges in predicting spontaneous closure, which is crucial for therapeutic decisions. Existing models mainly rely on structured echocardiographic parameters or restricted data. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, which uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with the aim of improving spontaneous closure predictability in PMVSD. Methods: We did a multicentre, retrospective analysis using data from 29 142 PMVSD patients across six tertiary centres in China from May, 2004, to September, 2022, for training (70%) and validation (30%; dataset 1, 27 269 patients), and from September, 2001, to December, 2009 for testing (dataset 2, 1873 patients). NLP extracted structured data from echocardiography reports and medical records, which were used to develop machine learning models. Models were evaluated for spontaneous closure occurrence and timing by use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration index. Findings: Spontaneous closure occurred in 3520 patients (12·1%) at a median of 31 months (IQR 16−56). Eleven NLP-derived predictors, identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, highlighted the importance of defect morphology and patient age. The random survival forest algorithm, selected for its superior concordance indexes, showed excellent predictive performance with validation set AUCs (95% CI) of 0·95 (0·94−0·96) for 1-year and 3-year predictions, and 0·95 (0·95−0·96) for 5-year predictions; testing set AUCs were 0·95 (0·94−0·97) for 1-year predictions, 0·97 (0·96−0·98) for 3-year predictions, and 0·98 (0·97−0·99) for 5-year predictions. The model showed high clinical utility through decision curve analysis, calibration, and risk stratification, maintaining consistent accuracy across centres and subgroups. Interpretation: This AI-based model for predicting spontaneous closure in PMVSD patients represents a substantial advancement, potentially improving patient management, reducing risks of delayed or inappropriate treatment, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {The applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the airport industry are significantly transforming operational efficiency, safety, and passenger experiences. This study investigates the integration of AI within aviation construction projects, with a focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While AI technologies such as facial recognition, IoT, and biometric systems have advanced airport security and operations, their use in construction project management remains limited. A survey was conducted among 101 engineering professionals and experts with experience or involvement in managing aviation-related construction projects. Participants, many of whom had familiarity with AI tools, provided insights into the applicability of AI in areas such as planning, scheduling, and safety monitoring. The majority agreed that AI has the potential to revolutionize project management processes, improving decision-making, and efficiency. AI tools can predict delays, optimize workflows, and enhance safety through real-time data analytics and machine learning algorithms, reducing risks and human error. Despite the UAE’s leadership in AI-driven security advancements, its use in aviation construction is still underdeveloped. This research highlights the potential for broader AI integration across the entire lifecycle of aviation projects. By adopting AI in these areas, UAE airports could set new benchmarks for cost effectiveness, sustainability, and project delivery, reinforcing the region’s status as a leader in technological innovation within the aviation industry. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Although construction is one of the oldest sectors of the global economy, the digital innovation and application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the industry are still insignificant. For the past several years, however, with rapid advancements in supporting technologies and computing power, the construction industry has made several strides in areas such as digitalization, data-driven design and planning, and automation. As the industry is in the process of adopting and customizing AI-powered tools and technologies in its daily workflows to improve safety, new opportunities are being created to enable human workers and stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate with AI in various aspects of project design, planning, construction, operation, and maintenance. The promise of human-AI collaboration in construction has, in turn, given rise to new research endeavors that focus on adaptability, usability, and expandability rather than mere algorithmic development. Prior to implementing any new AI technology in construction, users need to understand its impact on the human worker. Despite several systematic literature reviews on the applications of AI in construction, to date, there is limited investigation into the workers’ experience during such transition from traditional to AI-driven work. In this study, a systematic literature review on AI in the construction industry is conducted through the lens of how such implementation might affect human workers’ performance, behavior, and experience. The paper identifies common human factors involved in introducing AI and discusses the connection between those factors and potential AI applications in the industry. Finally, future directions for human-AI partnership in construction are outlined. © Journal of Engineering, Project, and Production Management (EPPM-Journal).},

This research aims to develop models for automating the review of construction contracts to extract information on risk and responsibility that will provide inputs for risk management plans. Models were trained on 2268 sentences from International Federation of Consulting Engineers templates and tested on an actual construction project contract containing 1217 sentences. A taxonomy classified sentences into Heading, Definition, Obligation, Risk, and Right categories with related parties of Contractor, Employer, and Shared. Twelve models employing diverse Natural Language Processing vectorization techniques and Machine Learning algorithms were implemented and benchmarked based on accuracy and F1 score. Binary classification of sentence types and an ensemble method integrating top models were further applied to improve performance. The best model achieved 89 % accuracy for sentence types and 83 % for related parties, demonstrating the capabilities of automated contract review for identification of risk and responsibilities. Adopting the proposed approach can significantly expedite contract reviews to support risk management activities, bid preparation processes and prevent disputes caused by overlooking risks and responsibilities. © 2025 The Authors},

Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a revolutionary role by enabling sophisticated path preparation and even prediction. AI-driven methodologies, including machine learning (ML) algorithms and intelligent path planning systems, were explored to optimize construction process and expenditure assessment. 200 medical center construction project datasets were utilized, with preprocessing stages utilizing mean imputation for absent data, min-max scaling to normalize, and dimension decrease by applying principle component analysis (PCA). The usage of AI-based path planning techniques is implemented for resource optimization, reducing construction delay, and site logistics optimization. Furthermore, it developed the Smart Tasmanian Devil-Enhanced Adaptive Gradient Boosting System (STD-AGB) that reached a direct cost assessment accuracy of 97% in the early stage of project initiation. The 12 critical factors affecting cost and construction efficiency included site preparation and electrical works, which demonstrated standard percentage errors of 8.02% and 5.11%, respectively. Such consequences underscore the probable responsibility of AI in refining path planning so that improved outcomes can be achieved and innovation in the intelligent construction of medical centers can be encouraged.

Recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancements offer promising solutions to enhance risk management. This systematic literature review (SLR) explores the integration of AI in construction risk management, focusing on AI applications, risk categories, and key algorithms. A total of 84 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024 were analysed. The SLR method involved rigorous identification, selection, and critical appraisal of studies, followed by bibliometric analysis to uncover research trends, influential authors, and thematic clusters. The bibliometric analysis, including keyword co-occurrence and author collaboration networks, provided insights into the structure of the research landscape. Findings revealed that AI methods such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), knowledge-based reasoning (KBR), optimisation algorithm (OA), and computer vision (CV) play crucial roles in predicting and managing risks. ML is employed for predictive modelling, NLP for document and compliance risk management, KBR for decision support, OA for optimising resources and schedules, and CV for real-time safety monitoring. Despite advancements, challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and workforce skills hinder full AI integration. Future research should explore AI's intersection with emerging technologies such as blockchain and adaptive risk models for responsible adoption.

Moreover, workplace learning contributes to professional development, helping individuals advance their careers and maintain relevance in their fields. However, when matching employees to specific project roles, in most cases, only the current skill level of an employee is considered. The skills an employee is interested in learning are often neglected. In our study, we present an AI-based system for matching employees to project roles in an IT environment not only based on skills but also their interests as interests are an important motivator for workplace learning. We analyze whether considering interests improves the matching between employees and projects from two perspectives: one investigating the employee’s perspective and the other the project manager’s. The presented model was evaluated focusing on the IT domain. In our study, we collected profiles of IT professionals and role requirements, which were used to generate personalized recommendations for employee-project matching. Our results show that 80.0% of the IT specialists, as well as 71.4% project managers responsible for specifying the role requirements and matching of the IT specialists, prefer recommendations made by a model that considers employees’ interests. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

All the studies reviewed used secondary data and favored supervised ML models, with random forest and XGBoost frequently demonstrating high performance. These tools assist in tracking access to services, predicting risks of STI/HIV, and developing models for community HIV clusters. While AI has enhanced the accuracy of diagnostics and the efficiency of management, several challenges persist, including ethical concerns, issues with data quality, and a lack of expertise in implementation. There are few real-world applications or pilot projects in SSA. Notably, most of the studies primarily focus on the development, validation, or technical evaluation of the ML methods rather than their practical application or implementation. As a result, the actual impact of these approaches on the point of care remains unclear. This review highlights the effectiveness of various AI and ML methods in managing HIV and STIs through detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The study strengthens knowledge on the practical application of 4IR technologies in diagnosing, treating, and managing STIs across SSA. Understanding this has potential to improve sexual health outcomes, address gaps in STI diagnosis, and surpass the limitations of traditional syndromic management approaches. © 2025 by the authors.},

This review synthesizes findings from 97 peer-reviewed studies published between 2011 and 2024, using the PRISMA methodology to ensure rigor and transparency. AI techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models have exhibited their potential to enhance PM techniques across projects’ phases, including planning, execution, and monitoring. Decision trees are created to represent the application of AI methodologies in various PM stages and tasks to facilitate understanding and real-world implementation. Among these are hybrid AI models that enhance risk assessment, duration forecasting, and cost estimation, as well as categorization based on project phases to optimize AI integration. Despite these advancements, there are still gaps in addressing dynamic project environments, validating AI models with real-world data, and expanding research into underexplored phases like project closure. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Historically, junior professionals have mentored senior professionals around new technologies, because juniors are typically more willing than seniors to perform lower-level tasks to learn new skills, better able than seniors to engage in real-time experimentation close to the work itself, and more willing than seniors to learn innovative methods that conflict with traditional identities and norms. However, we know little about what happens when emerging technologies have a high level of uncertainty in their use, because they have wide-ranging capabilities and are exponentially changing. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, specifically learning algorithms and LLMs, such contexts may be increasingly common. In our study conducted with the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we interviewed 78 junior consultants in July–August 2023 who had recently participated in a field experiment that gave them access for the first time to generative AI (GPT-4) for a strategic business problem solving task. Drawing from junior professionals' in situ reflections soon after the experiment, we found that junior professionals may fail to manage risks around uncertain emerging technologies because juniors are likely to recommend three kinds of novice risk work tactics that: 1) are grounded in a lack of deep understanding of technologies that have uncertain and wide-ranging capabilities and are changing exponentially, 2) focus on change to human routines rather than system design, and 3) focus on interventions at the project-level rather than system deployer- or ecosystem-level. The implications of novice risk work are that, when junior professionals are expected to be a source of expertise in the use of uncertain, emerging technologies, this can lead to learning failures. This study contributes to our understanding of occupational learning around emerging technologies, risk work in organizations, and human-computer interaction. © 2025},

There are many studies on educational chatbots in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; however, studies on designing and leveraging chatbots in a multidisciplinary field like project management have been scarce. Although some studies have incorporated elements to facilitate personalized or adaptive learning experience, more research on the design and evaluation of personalized adaptive learning chatbots is needed to offer learners more engaging learning experiences and help them achieve better outcomes. This study applies the concept of personalized adaptive learning, investigating how to design a personalized chatbot for training project management skills in higher education. By leveraging chatbot technology and generative AI, we built PMTutor, with personalized adaptive learning features, integrating it into a project management course. The results suggest that this type of chatbot can complement learning and engage learners by providing customized feedback during an exercise.

The primary objectives are to build a prototype using a camera and sensors for data collection, analyze a data logging system to record feeding habits and water consumption, and develop a mobile application to allow farmers to monitor the feeding system in real-time. The prototype, constructed using a Raspberry Pi 4 equipped with a camera module and ultrasonic sensors, collects real-time data on the status of feeding troughs, detecting whether they are empty, partially empty, or full. A YOLOv8n deep learning model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of images to classify these statuses accurately. The data logging system records and analyzes feeding habits and water consumption patterns, providing valuable insights into the goats' behavior and ensuring they have consistent access to food and water. The mobile application developed for this project, integrated with the Blynk app, provides farmers with real-time notifications and detailed reports on the feeding system's status. This allows for timely interventions, better resource management, and improved animal welfare. The project successfully combines hardware and software solutions to enhance the efficiency of goat farming, reducing manual labor and setting a foundation for future innovations in automated livestock management. By demonstrating the potential of integrating AI and IoT technologies in agriculture, this project highlights the benefits of continuous monitoring and timely alerts in maintaining a well-managed and sustainable farming operation. © The 2025 International Conference on Artificial Life and Robotics (ICAROB2025).},

	abstract = {The book presents a unique and structured interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from medicine, computer science, bioengineering, and other relevant fields. Due to this distinctive feature, the book offers a comprehensive exploration of the intricate relationship between potential AI applications and pain research and management. For example, one of its key aims is to provide valuable knowledge about AI for clinicians who may have limited familiarity with the subject, as well as for professionals in computer science and engineering. This approach is aimed at bridging the existing gap between these fields, offering clinicians insights into AI's potential applications, and providing computer scientists and engineers with a translational perspective on the practical needs in the clinical context. As widely demonstrated, the practical application of research faces a serious obstacle related to the limited communication and collaboration between research areas that are often very distant from each other. Therefore, this dual perspective could be useful to collocate the book as a valuable tool for fostering collaboration and understanding between these traditionally distinct domains. Furthermore, the structured framework of the book could not only facilitate learning but also serve as a foundation for future projects in the realm of AI and medicine. Specifically, it will be developed by following a framework useful for additional editorial projects, focusing more acutely on AI applications in anesthesia and critical care. By doing so, the book aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse and advancements in these specialized areas, filling a gap in the current literature. Therefore, the book seeks to make a meaningful contribution to the integration of AI in pain medicine, but also in other medical fields. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has become necessary to enhance efficiency, scalability, and performance in modern software systems. Instead of incorporating the AI functionality into their SDLC, traditional SDLC models typically add-on the AI software functionality after they have integrated AI functionality into their application or software process. Because of this, developers undergo inefficiencies in their development workflows, experience performance bottlenecks during testing, and experience challenges of incorporating AI to improve an application’s performance through optimization. This paper proposes a new AI-Optimized Software Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC), which is a holistic and comprehensive framework that encases the embedded AI capabilities and optimization strategies throughout the SDLC process during every stage of the development of the system, so that requirements-gathering, development, testing, and maintenance are hybrid software processes, and not dictated by AI vs. traditional software development processes. AI-SDLC presents new development roles such as AI Integration specialist, Code Optimizer and UX Optimization Specialist, which helps developers work across disciplines and increases collaborative interaction between traditional developers and AI engineers. AI-SDLC also utilizes an AI-driven automated hybrid software process in areas such as requirement elicitation, design/architecture validation, testing, deployment monitoring, and scalability to produce robust high-performance systems in all areas of practicing Software Development Life Cycle work. The discourse includes a rich case study based on a Smart Logistics Management System to demonstrate practical implementation of the AI-SDLC and how it facilitates system efficiency improvement and improved user experience. Additionally, the discussion also highlights the possibilities of AI-SDLC practical implementation in other industrial domain areas such as e-commerce, finance, aviation and enterprise solution based projects with practical considerations for implementation. In conclusion, the discussion provides findings that support AI-SDLC as a structured and intelligence-driven approach to Software Development Life Cycle implementation that addresses the weaknesses of traditional software design and development frameworks. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the broader impact of AI on the holistic design process, especially in collaborative settings, remains understudied. This paper contends that generative AI can augment both reflective and interactive functions within agile design workshops, thereby enriching the collaborative design experience. This paper presents findings from three agile design workshops that explicitly incorporated generative AI for university design students. The first case study examines individual product experience reports, the second analyses team discussion transcripts, and the third observes the active role of generative AI in the design process. Our insights extend beyond AI’s output performance to its implications for project management, offering a new perspective on the strategic use of AI in design education and practises.

	abstract = {This paper describes the motivation, framework, concepts, method, implementation, and results of the HCII2023 Design Café, a dedicated participatory highly interactive design workshop held in Copenhagen in July 2023. Motivated by the ubiquitous challenges our world is facing, this initiative had the goal to explore six main issues from an interdisciplinary perspective with a focus on the UN SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities” and the HCI Grand Challenge 2 “Human-Environment Interactions.” The six issues were formulated as questions and presented to the participants working in small groups. (1) How to create inclusive and ethical smart cities? (2) How to establish trust between people and smart environments? (3) How to address privacy concerns in smart environments that adopt the “disappearing computer” paradigm? (4) How to promote explainability and transparency of policies and measures to citizens of smart cities or in smart environments in general? (5) How to design incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior in smart cities at a personal as well as collective/corporate level? (6) How to measure success and impact in sustainable smart city projects? The method and approach of the Design Café is a tailored composition of a guided, structured format combined with and inspired by processes of informal communication and exchange of knowledge and ideas. Aligned moderation, a minimum set of rules, a set of relevant topics and an interdisciplinary group of motivated participants working in rotating formations provides the structure for achieving results. The results show that the six issues are not independent of each other, but require a holistic view, considering the various dependencies as well as synergies when exploring solutions. Nevertheless, the importance of first establishing higher-level goals based on ethical and inclusive approaches fostering human dignity and human rights were key. Acceptance of overall goals, processes, rules, and regulations was considered as the fundamental pre-requisite for sustainable change towards a declared goal. Acceptance needs trust and privacy as well as explainability and transparency of policies and measures. The role of incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior was twofold. Offering incentives must include planning on how to measure their impact. Effective measurement of success and impact depends heavily on how the institutions address privacy. Explainability and transparency should become one of the ethical guidelines that steer and control concepts, decision making, and implementations of all activities. The scale of these societal challenges still needs to be recognized by those responsible. It is essential to educate decision makers in the psychological needs and effects of sense making, comprehensibility, and finally acceptance and well-being moving towards a humanity-centered design. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Digital management of excavators has seen limited progress due to challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) training. The AI required for digital twinning of excavators necessitates a large volume of diverse imagery data, currently scarce in the construction domain. Moreover, the absence of deployable robot agents hinders reinforcement learning, impeding task-oriented AI development. In response, we introduce an innovative approach utilizing a miniature-scale, radio-controlled excavator (RC-excavator). This presents a cost-effective method for automated data collection and labeling, as well as interactive reinforcement learning. The RC-excavator's electric circuit was modified, its motion dynamics were modeled, and it was fully robotized for precise computer-directed motion control. Statistical validation of its motions achieved a Normalized Range Adjusted Accuracy (NRAA) of 99.14% for the bucket, 97.97% for the main arm, and 98.63% for the cabin. This confirms its adequacy for image labeling and task-oriented automation research.  © 2025 The Authors.},

In order to transfer the data to the data platform, different communication protocols (e.g. MQTT, 5G/6G, LoRaWAN, WiFi, CoAP, 6LoWPAN …) and data models/formats (NGSI-LD, XML, JSON, SensorThings …) should be put in place and utilized in a campus setting, such that data and information can flow into the logically centralized data platform. Our vision is to follow established smart city (pre-)standards for Open Urban Platforms, such as the DIN SPEC 91357, DIN SPEC 91397 and DIN SPEC 91377. By following such open modular approaches, we want to enable a framework of different software and hardware components as well as datasets, which can be used for teaching (e.g. in seminars and lectures) as well as for research activities in the course of PhD projects.

	abstract = {The wastewater conveyance systems in the United States are facing severe structural challenges, with the nation’s overall wastewater infrastructure receiving a critically low grade of D- from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Innovative trenchless technologies, such as Cured-in-Place Pipe Renewal Technology (CIPPRT), offer a cost-efficient substitute for traditional open-cut construction methods (OCCM). However, the possibility of a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) comparing these methods remains unexplored. LCCA examines the comprehensive financial impact, encompassing installation, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement expenses, using net present value (NPV) over a set duration. The objective of this study is to systematically review the existing literature to explore advancements in calculating the LCCA for CIPPRT and compare the latter approach to OCCM. A rigorous PRISMA-guided methodology applied to academic databases identified 845 publications (1995–2024), with 83 documents being selected after stringent screening. The findings reveal limited use of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) in predicting CIPPRT costs. A bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer visualizes the results. The study underscores the potential of intelligent, data-driven approaches, such as spreadsheet models and AI, to enhance decision-making in selecting rehabilitation methods tailored to project conditions. These advancements promise more sustainable and cost-effective management of sanitary sewer systems, offering vital insights for decision-makers in addressing critical infrastructure challenges. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In response to the escalating environmental, economic, and social challenges posed by Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) waste, the past two decades have witnessed a significant expansion in PET recycling and reuse research. This study conducts a systematic literature review of PET-related research published between 2000 and 2024, utilizing the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database's Advanced Search function to retrieve relevant literature. The searching strategy employed predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the selection of studies specifically related to PET recycling and reuse, ultimately identifying 4847 key research sources after manual screening. To systematically analyze the selected literature, a bibliometric clustering approach using VOSviewer was applied, revealing four dominant research areas: environmental impacts and economic performance, recycling technologies, waste management, and sector-specific applications. A conceptual framework was developed to synthesize key research trends, methodological approaches, and limitations across these domains. This study revealed that while PET recycling technologies have advanced significantly, challenges persist in terms of energy efficiency, cost competitiveness, and scalability. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies often overlook the end-of-life phase, limiting the accuracy of environmental impact evaluations, particularly in construction applications. Additionally, economic analyses of PET circularity remain fragmented, often failing to capture regional cost variations, market fluctuations, and the economic feasibility of emerging recycling methods. The study also identifies a lack of spatial-temporal research on PET material flows, limiting the ability to design adaptive and region-specific waste management strategies. Consequently, several promising research opportunities have been identified: (1) improving end-of-life lifecycle assessments for PET applications, particularly in construction; (2) optimizing chemical recycling methods; (3) enhancing enzyme catalytic efficiency, thermal stability, and scalability; (4) leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for precise PET sorting and waste flow optimization; (5) developing PET-specific data frameworks that incorporate spatial-temporal dimensions for tracking production, consumption, and recycling trends; (6) integrating informal and formal PET recycling systems in emerging economies; (7) exploring consumer perceptions, trust, and willingness to pay for recycled PET products; and (8) examining the interaction between recycling habits and infrastructure to optimize recycling system adoption and efficiency. Previous reviews predominately focused on technological advancements, environmental impacts, or specific industries. By contrast, this study adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating insights from materials science, chemical engineering, environmental science, and management studies. While most prior reviews emphasize PET recycling in packaging and textiles, this study extends the scope to construction, where PET reuse remains underexplored. By addressing these gaps, this review provides a more holistic understanding of PET circularity and identifies key research priorities for advancing both theory and practice. This review provides practical insights for industries and researchers by highlighting key gaps and opportunities for improving PET circularity. The findings can guide technological advancements, enhance waste management efficiency, and drive innovations in PET reuse across different sectors. Additionally, the study underscores the economic potential of PET circularity, offering strategic insights for businesses aiming to develop more cost-effective and sustainable PET recycling processes. By integrating environmental, technological, economic, and behavioral perspectives, this review lays a foundation for more efficient, scalable, and commercially viable PET recycling solutions, ultimately contributing to global sustainability efforts. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Risk identification is fundamental to effective risk management in any construction project. It is especially true for tunnel projects where technicality and complexity increase the risks, uncertainties, and challenges of realistic risk identification. However, two important issues need to be addressed in the current risk identification practice. First is the organization of previous project risk information (data) in unstructured and semistructured formats which hinders the use of emerging AI-based techniques and digitization of the risk management process. Second, overreliance on manual efforts and human experience, which is labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent question-answering system based on a knowledge graph and generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model. This study developed a tunnel risk knowledge graph (TRisKG) and then integrated the TRisKG with a GPT model to develop a question-answering system for tunnel project risks (QASTRisk). The proposed QASTRisk yielded a precision value of 97%, recall of 94%, and an F-1 score of 95%, indicating excellent performance compared to the existing studies. The proposed approach is appropriate for quick, effective, and intuitive risk identification at the early stage of tunnel projects as it can facilitate timely and reliable decision-making to prevent safety accidents and reduce project delays and cost overruns. Also, this work contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a framework for developing intelligent systems using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist project managers in automatic and efficient risk identification at the preconstruction phase of the project. Thus, this enhances decision-making, improves project performance and the efficiency of project risk management practices, and increases productivity in the construction industry. © ASCE, ISSN 0733-9364.},

This study introduces a novel approach utilizing the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) model, augmented with domain knowledge, to predict and categorize the risk factors for delays in road construction projects. Building on prior research, this study extends the models capabilities to include a broader range of delay factors. A thorough literature review was conducted to identify common delay factors in construction. The GPT-4 model, driven by domain-specific insights, constructs a predictive system capable of analyzing the text from project reports, thereby accurately categorizing delays. This study evaluates the model’s performance and demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods. Notably, the model achieved an 87% F1 score for overall delay risk categorization and a 98% F1 score for project management issues. Additional stakeholder insights highlight the benefits of AI-driven solutions enhanced by domain knowledge for effectively managing delay risks.

	abstract = {Construction meetings are essential for bringing together project participants to coordinate efforts, identify problems, and make decisions. Previous studies on meeting analysis relied on manual approaches to identify isolated pieces of information but struggled with providing a high-level overview that targeted real-time problem identification and resolution. Despite the rich discussions that occur, the sheer volume of information exchanged can make it difficult to discern key issues, decisions, and action items. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide sophisticated natural language processing capabilities that can effectively distill essential information and highlight actionable insights from meeting transcripts. However, these technologies are often underutilized in practice, despite their potential to significantly enhance the analysis and management of meeting data. This study introduced the Meet2Mitigate (M2M) framework, which integrates cutting-edge technologies, including speaker diarization, automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLMs, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to revolutionize how construction meetings are captured and analyzed. In this framework, construction meeting recordings can be converted into a structured format, differentiated by timestamps, speakers, and corresponding contents. Different speakers’ dialogues are then summarized to extract the main project-related issues. For quick mitigation responses, this framework combines LLMs with a retrieval mechanism to access the Construction Industry Institute (CII) Best Practices (BPs) knowledge pool, generating detailed action items to drive problem-solving. The validation results demonstrated that the M2M prototype can automatically generate a tailored end-to-end problem-to-solution report in real time by only using a meeting recording file. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study advances TD identification in issues tracker using transformer-based models, addressing the critical need for accurate and efficient TD identification in large-scale software development. Our methodology employs multiple binary classifiers for TD and its type, combined through ensemble learning, to enhance accuracy and robustness in detecting various forms of TD. We train and evaluate these models on a comprehensive dataset from GitHub Archive Issues (2015–2024), supplemented with industrial data validation. We demonstrate that in-project fine-tuned transformer models significantly outperform task-specific fine-tuned models in TD classification, highlighting the importance of project-specific context in accurate TD identification. Our research also reveals the superiority of specialized binary classifiers over multi-class models for TD and its type identification, enabling more targeted debt resolution strategies. A comparative analysis shows that the smaller DistilRoBERTa model is more effective than larger language models like GPTs for TD classification tasks, especially after fine-tuning, offering insights into efficient model selection for specific TD detection tasks. The study also assesses generalization capabilities using metrics such as MCC, AUC ROC, Recall, and F1 score, focusing on model effectiveness, fine-tuning impact, and relative performance. By validating our approach on out-of-distribution and real-world industrial datasets, we ensure practical applicability, addressing the diverse nature of software projects. This research significantly enhances TD detection and offers a more nuanced understanding of TD types, contributing to improved software maintenance strategies in both academic and industrial settings. The release of our curated dataset aims to stimulate further advancements in TD classification research, ultimately enhancing software project outcomes and development practices by enabling early TD identification and management. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper explores the essential role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) competencies and literacy in the fields of records management and archival practices, within the framework of the InterPARES Trust AI project. As AI technologies advance, archival professionals must acquire specific skills and knowledge to effectively integrate these technologies into their workflows. The study employs two complementary approaches: (1) a detailed competency framework developed through literature reviews, interviews with archival professionals who have applied AI to the processing of records, and validation workshops with practitioners; and (2) a comprehensive AI literacy framework derived from multiple case studies and theoretical discussions. Our empirical approach to derive these AI competencies for the archival professions is novel in the scholarly literature. Findings indicate that archival professionals can leverage AI in their work practices by acquiring basic AI literacy, practical AI skills, data-related skills, tool-testing and evaluation, adaptation of AI to their workflows, and by actively engaging in collaborative projects with information technology (IT) developers. In addition, there are significant ethical concerns regarding algorithmic biases and data privacy that need to be addressed. We support an interdisciplinary approach that combines archival science, computing, and ethical considerations to develop trustworthy AI solutions. By integrating these fields, practitioners can better understand and manage the implications of AI in their work. Arguments are presented to use our AI literacy and competency framework as a general guide to be refined and situated by archival educators and practitioners for professional development in their own specific contexts. To stay current with technological advances and fully leverage the potential of AI, continuous updates and development of AI literacy among records management and archiving professionals are crucial. This study highlights the need for continued education and interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve these goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the last decade, the development of Deep Learning and its variants, based on the application of artificial neural networks, has reinvigorated Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a result, many new applications of AI in medicine, especially Radiology, have been introduced. This resurgence in AI, and its diverse clinical and nonclinical applications throughout healthcare, requires a thorough understanding to reap the potential benefits and avoid the potential pitfalls. Methods: To realize the full potential of AI in medicine, a highly coordinated approach should be undertaken to select, support and finance more highly focused AI projects. By studying and understanding the successes and failures, and strengths and limitations, of AI in Radiology, it is possible to seek and develop the most clinically relevant AI algorithms. The authors have reviewed their clinical practice regarding the use of AI to determine applications in which AI can add both clinical and remunerative benefits. Results: Review of our policies and applications regarding AI in the Department of Radiology emphasized that, at the time of this writing, AI has been useful in the detection of specific clinical entities for which the AI algorithms have been designed. In addition to helping to reduce diagnostic errors, AI offers an important opportunity to prioritize positive cases, such as pulmonary embolism or intracranial hemorrhage. It has become apparent that the detection of certain conditions, such as incidental and unsuspected cerebral aneurysms can be used to initiate a variety of patient-oriented activities. Finding an unsuspected brain aneurysm is not only of clinical importance to the patient, but the required clinical workup and management of the patient can help generate reimbursement that helps defray the cost of AI implementations. A program for screening, clinical management, and follow-up, facilitated by the AI detection of incidental brain aneurysms, has been implemented at our multi-hospital healthcare system. Conclusion: We feel that it is possible to avoid missed opportunities for AI in Radiology and create AI tools to enhance medical wisdom and improve patient care, within a fiscally responsive environment. © CARS 2024.},

	abstract = {The introduction of synthetic intellect in the processes and procedures also termed artificial intelligence (AI) has risen as a disruptive catalyst across many different sectors. AI has found widespread application in automated systems, financing, and healthcare. With the increasing use of AI, models and algorithms have started surpassing the significant ideals of human performance. The significance of generative AI (GenAI) lies in its concentration on the realms of knowledge work and creative labor, which encompasses a significant number of humans, totalling billions. Procreative AI or GenAI has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and creativity of people by at least 10%. It can also improve their speed, efficiency, and overall capabilities to some extent. GenAI possesses the capability of generating immense economic value up to trillions of dollars. AI systems used to be rule-based and had limited capabilities. The emergence of algorithms for deep learning toward the century's end paved the way for more sophisticated GenAI models. GenAI is a specialized branch of AI that specifically concentrates on the production of novel content, including audio, video, and writings, through the utilization of artificially intelligent deep learning algorithms. Implementing AI for decision-making in sustainable project life cycle operations remains difficult. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has empowered developers to engage with generative algorithms, effectively transforming natural language queries into code for diverse programming languages. Highly advanced technologies such as Codacy and OpenAI Codex are widely utilized to assist LLMs and their adoption is steadily growing. GenAI solutions leverage aspects such as "completion" to significantly improve the creation of software. AI is extensively used in a number of manufacturing organizations, including those in healthcare, finance, robotics, and automation. However, using AI to make decisions in sustainable project life cycle management is still a difficult undertaking. The present research explores the utilization of AI techniques for decision-making to promote sustainable operations throughout the various phases of a project life cycle. This chapter compares the existing GenAI project life cycles and also suggests the practical framework, as also provides the various futuristic recommendations for sustainable project life cycles. ©2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Cost and safety are the two main issues surrounding material handling in companies. The management considers both the safest and quickest route during transit in addition to the cost. The path that is chosen based on safety assessments and the cost of transportation for each route will be covered in this chapter. The Cost-Safety matrix for risk analysis of transportation pathways will be introduced in this chapter. The safety matrix is tied to the path (route), and the cost matrix is related to the transportation cost element. The cost-safety matrix considers both the risk associated with a certain path and the expense of that approach. Using historical data, a numeric range of values is allocated to create the risk matrix. A three-part matrix is created by combining the risk level and the cost of transportation. Low, moderate, and highrisk levels are the categories used to describe them. This matrix may be used to select the route before the transport is started. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into material handling procedures is essential for maximizing productivity and guaranteeing worker security. With a major focus on recognizing and minimizing possible dangers connected with lifting, moving, and managing goods, this research focuses on the use of AI in the risk assessment of material handling jobs. The study analyzes enormous datasets on material handling activities using sensor technologies, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms. The goal of the project is to create a strong risk assessment system that can automatically identify, anticipate, and reduce possible dangers related to falling objects, collapsing loads, inappropriate lifting procedures, and struck-by hazards by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

The problem addressed revolves around the need to effectively manage costs in civil engineering endeavors amidst the growing complexity of projects and the increasing integration of AI technologies. The methodology employed involves the utilization of three MCDM tools, specifically Delphi, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). A total of 17 AI factors, categorized into eight broad groups, were identified and analyzed. Through the application of different MCDM techniques, the relative importance and interrelationships among these factors were determined. The key findings reveal the critical role of certain AI factors, such as risk mitigation and cost components, in optimizing the cost management processes. Moreover, the hierarchical structure generated through ISM and the influential factors identified via MICMAC provide insights for prioritizing strategic interventions. The implications of this study extend to informing decision-makers in the civil engineering domain about effective strategies for leveraging AI in their cost management practices. By adopting a systematic MCDM approach, stakeholders can enhance project outcomes while optimizing resource allocation and mitigating financial risks. © 2024 by the authors.},

Then, in the context of the existing literature, we explore recent technologies, including blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics that are helping to deal with the challenges in green finance. We show that data-driven approaches utilizing AI and ML help in the risk assessment of green projects; FinTech-based crowdfunding platforms provide innovative green financial products and regulatory technologies (RegTech) support in compliance with regulations. We also identify that the environmental footprint of cryptocurrencies is an emerging area in the technologies and green finance domain.

Discharge management (DM) is crucial for continuing care, yet process-related issues persist. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-supported systems may address DM-related issues, but research on the needs of hospital staff is limited. This paper presents results from the first phase of a multicenter project aimed at developing an AI-supported system to predict aftercare needs and improve DM processes in German hospitals. We conducted an exploratory needs analysis using participatory methods (workshops, questionnaires and interviews) and defined suitable use cases. We observed a high level of interest in the proposed AI-supported system. However, participants expressed doubts about the effective implementation due to the current state of their hospital's digital infrastructure.

	abstract = {In safety-critical IT projects, the success of which is crucial to public safety, the failure of an IT system can have far-reaching consequences. In practice, however, the reuse of valuable experience-based knowledge, which is often available in natural language and on different IT systems or in physical documents, poses a considerable challenge. If this experience-based knowledge is not taken into account, the consequences can be serious and lead to high additional costs and considerable project delays. One possible approach to solving these problems lies at the interface of business administration, business informatics and computer science. This approach combines the previously separate disciplines of project management, knowledge management and artificial intelligence (AI). It shows how proven "traditional" AI techniques, especially ontologies and case-based reasoning, can be used effectively in safety-critical IT projects. By combining ontology-supported case-based reasoning with artificial neural networks for the "modern" Word2Vec technique, a cloud-based software is designed that can be used to significantly improve the reuse of experience-based knowledge in safety-critical IT projects. The article presented here shows how the combination of traditional and modern AI techniques can provide a key to the systematic reuse of mission-critical experience-based knowledge in IT projects. © 2024 The authors.

	abstract = {Grading is one of the most relevant hurdles for instructors, diverting instructor's focus on the development of engaging learning activities, class preparation, and attending to students' questions. Institutions and instructors are continuously looking for alternatives to reduce educators' time required on grading, frequently, resulting in hiring teaching assistants whose inexperience and frequent rotation can lead to inconsistent and subjective evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 may alleviate grading challenges; however, research in this field is limited when dealing with assignments requiring specialized knowledge, complex critical thinking, subjective, and creative. This research investigates whether GPT-4's scores correlate with human grading in a construction capstone project and how the use of criteria and rubrics in GPT influences this correlation. Projects were graded by two human graders and three training configurations in GPT-4: no detailed criteria, paraphrased criteria, and explicit rubrics. Each configuration was tested through 10 iterations to evaluate GPT consistency. Results challenge GPT-4's potential to grade argumentative assignments. GPT-4's score correlates slightly better (although poor overall) with human evaluations when no additional information is provided, underscoring the poor impact of the specificity of training materials for GPT scoring in this type of assignment. Despite the LLMs' promises, their limitations include variability in consistency and reliance on statistical pattern analysis, which can lead to misleading evaluations along with privacy concerns when handling sensitive student data. Educators must carefully design grading guidelines to harness the full potential of LLMs in academic assessments, balancing AI's efficiency with the need for nuanced human judgment. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Many economic, political and socio-cultural events in the 2020s have been strong headwinds for architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Nevertheless, technological advancements (e.g. artificial intelligence (AI), big data and robotics) provide promising avenues for the development of AEC. This study aims to map the state of the literature on automation in AEC and thereby be of value not only to those researching automation and its composition of a variety of distinct technological and system classes within AEC, but also to practitioners and policymakers in shaping the future of AEC. Design/methodology/approach: This review adopts scientometric methods, which have been effective in the research of large intra and interdisciplinary domains in the past decades. The full dataset consists of 1,871 articles on automation in AEC. Findings: This overarching scientometric review offers three interdisciplinary streams of research: technological frontiers, project monitoring and applied research in AEC. To support the scientometric analysis, the authors offer a critical integrative review of the literature to proffer a multilevel, multistage framework of automation in AEC, which demonstrates an abundance of technological paradigm discussions and the inherent need for a holistic managerial approach to automation in AEC. Originality/value: The authors underline employee well-being, business sustainability and social growth outcomes of automation and provide several managerial implications, such as the strategic management approach, ethical management view and human resource management perspective. In doing so, the authors seek to respond to the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the United Nations as this becomes more prevalent for the industry and all levels of society in general. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The case study used a mixed methods approach, and a sample of stakeholders dealing in the Iraq Stock Exchange was taken during 2023 in Iraq. Data collection mainly included a survey conducted on 168 beneficiaries who trade stocks in the stock market, after which 22 clients were selected for personal interviews based on their voluntary willingness to participate in individual interviews. The results revealed beneficiaries prefer to use Artificial Intelligence to get new ideas for tasks or to help them with "plans" for their projects. The results also revealed that artificial intelligence applications raise concerns about ethics and reliability in their use to disclose financial information and their exploitation by management to obtain financial funding against beneficiaries' will. Finally, the results revealed that most current educational curricula differ from technological developments.

	abstract = {The development of a nation's infrastructure is a defining paradigm. Due to the complexity of putting together and running such programs. For developing countries like India, the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model has emerged as one of the best suited ways of project delivery. India's developing economy necessitates efficient and timely project completion at the lowest possible cost. Government involvement and private sector expertise are combined in the PPP concept. Note that highway construction is crucial to the development of other types of infrastructure. However, highway construction is fraught with uncertainty due to factors like land acquisition, traffic management, weather, and more. Maintaining an economy's current rate of growth, high-quality infrastructure is the single most important factor. All modes of transportation fall under this category, from cars and buses to trains and planes, as well as the provision of potable water and agricultural irrigation. However, a lot of money is needed in this industry. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are being pushed to speed up infrastructure development and meet such needs. Private-public partnerships (PPPs) include both public- and private-sector collaborations. To provide the necessary structure and person capacities, governments that have embarked on PPPs projects have often created new policy, legal, and institutional frameworks. Following the identification of key factors affecting PPP performance, a case study of the Porbandar-Dwarka highway construction project is used to compare and contrast three distinct PPP (BOT-Toll, BOT- Annuity, and HAM) models. Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value are two key financial indicators that favor HAM over BOT-Toll and BOT-Annuity. Finally, the FIDIC requirements and the financial and legal conditions from the models are combined to suggest a new PPP framework. The particular findings of this study will help policymakers, investors, and planners in Gujarat complete future highway development projects on schedule and under budget. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The excitement surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) is palpable. It is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use. In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees’ jobs more fulfilling — managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process. © 2024},

	abstract = {The global mental health decline, intensified by the pandemic, economic strain, and isolation, has led to increased anxiety and depression levels. The shortage of mental health services exacerbates this crisis, creating a significant care gap, especially for the underprivileged. In response, this project emerges with three primary objectives: to explore mental health elements, including emotional stability and stress management; to develop an artificial intelligence–driven home environment that reacts to the inhabitants’ emotions to enhance mental wellness; and to create an auto-journaling system that captures users’ emotions through user-friendly devices, encouraging self-reflection and prioritizing individual well-being. This project employs emotional data from users to enable smart home systems to utilize machine learning technology and artificial intelligence, crafting a living space tailored to each user’s specific needs. A key component is the integration of a humanoid robot as a companion, pivotal to this user-centric framework. The participant group consists of urban students from diverse genders and educational backgrounds in arts and science, focusing on capturing varied emotional experiences with the AI system, although limited by a small sample size. This approach aims to empower individuals to manage their mental health effectively. By initiating this project, the goal is to stimulate conversation and foster ongoing research and innovation at the crossroads of technology and mental health. Ultimately, it seeks to contribute to the development of better interventions in an increasingly digitized society, addressing the urgent need for enhanced mental health support. In conclusion, the mental health and well-being app makes its attempt to address the global mental health decline by providing personalized support for underserved populations. Its success lies in the integration of an AI-driven smart home system, an auto-journaling feature, and a humanoid robot companion, all designed to empower users to manage their mental wellness. Statistical data demonstrates the app’s positive impact on emotional well-being, highlighting its transformative potential in the evolving landscape of mental health technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Image classification is increasingly being utilized on construction sites to automate project monitoring, driven by advancements in reality-capture technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Deploying real-time applications remains a challenge due to the limited computing resources available on-site, particularly on remote construction sites that have limited telecommunication support or access due to high signal attenuation within a structure. To address this issue, this research proposes an efficient edge-computing-enabled image classification framework for support of real-time construction AI applications. A lightweight binary image classifier was developed using MobileNet transfer learning, followed by a quantization process to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. A complete edge computing hardware module, including components like Raspberry Pi, Edge TPU, and battery, was assembled, and a multimodal software module (incorporating visual, textual, and audio data) was integrated into the edge computing environment to enable an intelligent image classification system. Two practical case studies involving material classification and safety detection were deployed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results demonstrated the developed prototype successfully synchronized multimodal mechanisms and achieved zero latency in differentiating materials and identifying hazardous nails without any internet connectivity. Construction managers can leverage the developed prototype to facilitate centralized management efforts without compromising accuracy or extra investment in computing resources. This research paves the way for edge “intelligence” to be enabled for future construction job sites and promote real-time human-technology interactions without the need for high-speed internet. © 2024 by the authors.},

The data were analyzed by using software, called SPSS AMOS. Findings: The analysis of the structural model proves that there is a positive and significant relationship between emerging technologies and construction safety performance. Moreover, the factor loadings for each factor were found to be high indicating a good representation of the construct by the components developed. Among the technologies, BIM, robotics and automation, AI and wearable devices were detected to be the most significant technologies in terms of impacting safety performance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the body of knowledge in that it develops a conceptual framework consisting of specific technologies in terms of emerging technologies, reveals the impact of such technologies on safety performance and proposes several tools and strategies for enabling effective safety management along the project lifecycle. Industry practitioners may benefit from the framework developed by adopting such technologies to enhance their safety performance on construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Ship refit operations encompass various tasks such as renovation and repair in shipyards, which have become increasingly important recently. Efficient scheduling of these tasks relies heavily on accurate task duration estimates from domain experts. Our study focuses on assessing the impact of using ML algorithms for these estimates on ship refit project schedules, evaluated using a periodic re-optimization approach based on actuals, leveraging a constraint programming model in the optimization process. We compare three methods: expert estimates, historical data forecasting, and augmented human-AI forecasting. Through experimental analysis, we evaluate their performance in predicting task duration and improving the robustness of ship refit project schedules. The results demonstrate the benefit of the augmented human-AI model in providing task duration predictions, yielding more robust ship refit project schedules and limiting the disruptions in resource allocation over the planning horizon. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that the predict-then-optimize approach enhances the robustness of ship refit project schedules, suggesting the approach’s potential to be readily generalized for optimization in other project scheduling domains, such as aviation maintenance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Accurate earthwork quantity estimation is essential for effective project planning and cost management in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Traditional methods for quantity takeoff are often time-consuming and susceptible to human error, particularly when working with unstructured datasets such as CAD drawings. This study introduces the Earthwork Network Architecture (ENA), a novel deep learning framework that incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers to automate and enhance the accuracy of earthwork quantity estimation. We assume that if LLMs can be trained effectively using such unstructured construction dataset, the effects such as improved accuracy and the challenges of LLMs can be clearly examined. Among the architectures tested, the LLM-based ENA demonstrated superior performance, achieving faster convergence, greater loss reduction, and higher classification accuracy, with a Quantity Takeoff Classification accuracy of 97.17%. However, the LLMs required significantly more computational resources compared with other models. These findings suggest that LLMs, typically used in natural language processing, can be effectively adapted for complex AEC datasets. This study lays the groundwork for future AI-driven solutions in the AEC industry, underscoring the potential of LLMs and Transformers to automate the quantity takeoff process and manage multimodal data in construction projects. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition, lacks a cure, but its symptoms can be managed. Its complex diagnosis and assessment need ongoing monitoring, highlighting the potential use of digital assessment tools for enhancing patient management, even outside the clinical settings. In this vein, this paper proposes a smartphone-based video analysis approach for assessing motor skills, particularly balance and posture, in individuals diagnosed with PD. In particular, the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) ratings for items "3.8"(leg agility), "3.9"(arising from chair),"3.13"(posture) and "3.10"(gait) are estimated by capturing and analysing video from PD patients, while performing a Comprehensive Motor Function Test. Specifically, a 3D pose landmark detection (skeleton extraction) model based on the the MediaPipe Machine Learning Platform is used and different motion features are estimated from the captured videos that may correlate with the MDS-UPDRS assessments provided by clinicians. A machine learning pipeline (evaluating five different ML classifiers) is then proposed to examine the feasibility of using these features for monitoring the balance and posture of PD patients. Experimental results, obtained using a cohort of 17 Greek PD patients, voluntarily participating in this study, demonstrate that certain features have significant correlation with the clinical MDS-UPDRS ratings. These promising results showcase the potentiality of digital assessment to provide objective representation of the PD patient's motor skills, supporting both PD clinical assessment and self-management. Ongoing work within the AI-PROGNOSIS project will further validate these findings within a larger cohort and from additional countries.  © 2024 ACM.},

	abstract = {This study explores the development of soft skills in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. Initially, the study, through an anonymous online survey, explored why students use AI and large language models (LLMs). It was found that students use AI for general and academic purposes. From a general perspective, students use AI and LLMs for (1) convenience, (2) lack of time, and (3) lack of curiosity/interest. From an academic perspective, students use AI and LLM platforms as they (1) lack familiarity/knowledge, (2) lack basic skills, (3) lack confidence, (4) have an eagerness to score high grades, and (5) wish to provide different perspectives. To assist in developing students’ soft skills and discourage possible destructive outcomes in the AI era, the study suggests integrating AI platforms as part of teaching. This integration can be carried out by (1) introducing AI tools to students in a productive manner, (2) aligning the use of AI tools with the curriculum and teaching styles, (3) planning lessons and interactive activities using AI platforms, and (4) using AI tools to provide feedback and vice versa. In communication courses, instructors shall (1) create a supportive environment, (2) organize classroom discussions and debates, (3) create public speaking opportunities, (4) provide room for oral communication practices, (5) integrate the use of technology and multimedia, and (6) provide feedback and reflection. In business writing courses, instructors shall (1) encourage effective communication in classrooms, (2) facilitate collaboration and teamwork, (3) use role-play scenarios, (4) introduce project management tools, (5) teach professional etiquette, and (6) organize networking events. In composition courses, instructors shall (1) embrace technology, (2) teach students to critically evaluate online sources, (3) design assignments that require critical analysis, (4) encourage creative writing assignments, (5) promote imagination and originality, and (6) conduct workshops. These practices, which are provided in line with AlAfnan’s taxonomy of educational objectives, shall assist students in developing their soft skills in a way that maintains the relevance of classroom teaching in the AI era. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Industry 5.0 is an emerging value-driven manufacturing model in which human–machine interface-oriented intelligent manufacturing is one of the core concepts. Based on the theoretical human–cyber–physical system (HCPS), a reference framework for human–machine collaborative additive manufacturing for Industry 5.0 is proposed. This framework establishes a three-level product–economy–ecology model and explains the basic concept of human–machine collaborative additive manufacturing by considering the intrinsic characteristics and functional evolution of additive manufacturing technology. Key enabling technologies for product development process design are discussed, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), digital twin (DT) technology, extended reality, and intelligent materials. Additionally, the typical applications of human–machine collaborative additive manufacturing in the product, economic, and ecological layers are discussed, including personalized product design, interactive manufacturing, human–machine interaction (HMI) technology for the process chain, collaborative design, distributed manufacturing, and energy conservation and emission reductions. By developing the theory of the HCPS, for the first time its core concepts, key technologies, and typical scenarios are systematically elaborated to promote the transformation of additive manufacturing towards the Industry 5.0 paradigm of human–machine collaboration and to better meet the personalized needs of users. © 2024 by the authors.},

Code ownership, pivotal in the evolution of such projects, offers insights into developer engagement and potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we leverage the code ownership metrics to empirically investigate the correlation with the latent vulnerabilities across five prominent open-source AI software projects. The findings from the large-scale empirical study suggest a positive relationship between high-level ownership (characterised by a limited number of minor contributors) and a decrease in vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the time metrics, anchored on the project's duration, individual source code file timelines, and the count of impacted releases. These metrics adeptly categorise distinct phases of open-source AI software projects and their respective vulnerability intensities. With these novel code ownership metrics, we have implemented a Python-based command-line application to aid project curators and quality assurance professionals in evaluating and benchmarking their on-site projects. We anticipate this work will embark a continuous research development for securing and measuring open-source AI project security. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AI offers unprecedented opportunities for streamlining processes, enhancing productivity, and elevating safety standards. The study explored AI implementation opportunities and how AI technologies can drive innovation, enhance decision-making processes, and propel the sector toward a more efficient and digitised future in the construction industry. To fill the gap, the study adopted a quantitative research approach to offer a holistic assessment of the effects and opportunities for the advancement of AI in Ghanaian construction settings. Based on the quantitative survey data obtained from 97 participants from 10 construction companies in the Central Region of Ghana and the literature review, the study revealed several benefits of AI implementation. The importance of using AI has been seen in design and planning, safety management, and the quality of delivered projects. Regression analysis also expands on the relationships between the identified AI-based efficiencies, underlining that increased utilisation can enhance productivity and safety and reduce adverse environmental impacts. Further, in the context of Ghana, the study outlined areas of importance for constructing AI in the construction industry: construction monitoring, energy efficiency, and supply chain. These findings have depicted the sector’s awareness of AI and its value as a tool for improving effectiveness in operations and implementing sustainable measures. Overall, the knowledge generated by this study proves beneficial for directing strategic planning and advancing innovation in the context of the Ghanaian construction industry. In as much as it acknowledges the gap and the prevailing theoretical literature, it ushers in a guide for availing AI-driven growth in the construction sector in terms of productivity, quality, and sustainability in Ghana and the global space. © 2024, Interdisciplinary Publishing Academia.

Initially, a questionnaire was answered by 84 respondents, followed by in-depth interviews with seven experienced project managers. The primary objective was to assess the extent of AI integration in project management practices and its perceived benefits. The findings reveal that a significant number of project managers in Norway have already incorporated AI tools into their workflows. These tools are primarily utilized for task automation, predictive analytics, and resource allocation. Project managers reported that AI significantly enhances efficiency by automating routine tasks, thereby allowing them to focus on more strategic activities. Additionally, AI tools provide valuable insights through data analysis, enabling more informed decision-making and greater project flexibility. Despite the overall positive reception, some respondents highlighted challenges such as the steep learning curve associated with new AI technologies and concerns over data security. These challenges, however, are manageable and can be addressed with proper training and robust data protection measures. The consensus is clear - AI has the potential to transform project management, making it more dynamic and adaptable to changing project demands. This study underscores the growing importance of AI in the project management domain in Norway. It suggests that ongoing advancements in AI technology will likely lead to even greater integration and reliance on these tools in the future. Further research is recommended to explore long-term impacts and the development of best practices for AI adoption in project management. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

This paper focuses on automating the classification of EIR paragraphs according to the ISO 19650 standard’s categories, aiming to improve information management in construction projects. It addresses a gap in applying AI to enhance BIM project management, where barriers often include technological limitations, a shortage of specialists, and limited understanding of the methodology. The proposed method uses Word2Vec for text vectorisation and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with an RBF kernel for text classification, and it attempts to apply Word2Vec with cosine similarity for text generation. The model achieved an average F1 score of 0.7, with predicted categories for provided sentences and similar matches for selected phrases. While the text classification results were promising, further refinement is required for the text generation component. This study concludes that integrating AI tools such as Word2Vec and SVM offers a feasible solution for enhancing EIR creation. However, further development of text generation, particularly using advanced techniques such as GPT, is recommended.

	abstract = {This talk summarizes important experiences we cultivated in several projects where we developed AI methods for industrial customers like chemical production plants or gas fired power plants.One might think that applying leading edge AI methods to large quantities of industrial data will automatically yield valuable results. In our experience there are many "traditional"obstacles that need to be removed, before the magic can happen [2].For many use cases, data from various sources need to be integrated. For example, time series data stored in industrial Data Historians need to be labeled according to quality data stored in Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). The process data like setpoints and raw material characteristics need to be contextualized using the production data, e.g. production orders, raw material lots, from ERP systems. Although many companies are currently building up enterprise data lakes, the reality in many plants still is that data is locked in separate silos and a real-Time data integration requires significant efforts.Building, automating and operating a large industrial plant requires major (traditional) engineering efforts and expertise. Data scientists usually have different backgrounds and often lack knowledge, for example in control systems engineering and process engineering. In addition, many important engineering artifacts like Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) and process design document are either not up to date or even unavailable at all. However, in order to define relevant use cases and design powerful AI solutions, quite a high level of both traditional engineering and data science know-how is required. This means that traditional plant experts need to closely cooperate with data science experts. In the long run, software tools like ABB AbilityTM BatchInsight will be able to offer easy to use solutions for a broad class of use-cases, so that plant experts can use AI solutions without the need for additional consulting [3].Many industrial AI methods work with time series data. A larger industrial plant like a refinery can have many tens of thousands different time series. In the best case a consistent hierarchical naming schema is available and for each time series a good description exists. In reality, it can be cumbersome to identify the best set of time series related to the use case at hand [1]. In addition, data quality needs to be ensured. For example, if sensors are not properly calibrated, using this data can destroy AI models. In one of our projects, a sensor was being replaced at a certain point in time and the measured value changed from power to current. For convenience and because of the typical time pressure during daily operation, the new value was stored in the old variable. Our AI methods identified this abrupt change in system behavior, however this finding had no value for the customer.Industrial plants and their subsystems have different operating states that often need to be clearly separated. For example, if a time interval where the plant was in fault condition is accidentally included to train a reference model, the quality of this model will degrade.In summary, various challenges exist in the application of industrial AI solutions. Our talk will provide our learnings in addressing these challenges and will help to ask the following five questions before starting an industrial AI project:•Can we define a use case with sufficient business value?•Are people both with domain expertise and with expertise in AI committed to the project?•Will the communication between domain experts and AI experts be good enough?•Is all required data available for the project in sufficient quantities?•Is the quality of the data sufficient or are additional preparation and cleaning efforts required? © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {In an effort to deliver exceptional customer service, organizations are increasingly recognising the critical role that advanced language models (LLMs) play in the integration of CRM systems. This article explores the forefront of chatbot technology, with a particular focus on the essential function they play in contemporary consumer relationship management. The ability of chatbots to provide personalized and contextually pertinent responses to customer inquiries has been significantly enhanced by the rapid development of LLMs, specifically in the areas of sentiment, intent, and context comprehension. Organizations have the opportunity to enhance customer contentment and optimize operations by leveraging the capabilities of these advanced AI systems. In addition, offline capabilities guarantee continuous support, thereby enhancing customer confidence and loyalty in a time when connectivity fluctuations continue to be a challenge. The present study introduces an innovative offline chatbot system that aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cloud-based counterparts. By efficiently integrating data from various sources, such as project documentation and social media, this chatbot is capable of operating independently and delivering assistance to users, even in locations with sporadic internet connectivity. The experimental outcomes illustrate that our newly developed chatbot model outperforms established benchmarks, as evidenced by its 4.1-second inference time, 90.2-point BLEU score, and 9.7-point WER score. These metrics underscore the model’s effectiveness, precision, and timeliness in handling user inquiries and producing responses of exceptional quality. The experiments we conduct are designed to validate the effectiveness of our model in improving customer service experiences within CRM systems through comprehensive performance testing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {This study implements a conflict management training approach guided by principles of transformative learning and conflict management practice simulated via an LLM. Transformative learning is more effective when learners are engaged mentally and behaviorally in learning experiences. Correspondingly, the conflict management training approach involved a three-step procedure consisting of a learning phase, a practice phase enabled by an LLM, and a reflection phase. Fifty-six students enrolled in a systems development course were exposed to the transformative learning approach to conflict management so they would be better prepared to address any potential conflicts within their teams as they approached a semester-long software development project. The study investigated the following: (1) How did the training and practice affect students’ level of confidence in addressing conflict? (2) Which conflict management styles did students use in the simulated practice? (3) Which strategies did students employ when engaging with the simulated conflict? The findings indicate that: (1) 65% of the students significantly increased in confidence in managing conflict by demonstrating collaborative, compromising, and accommodative approaches; (2) 26% of the students slightly increased in confidence by implementing collaborative and accommodative approaches; and (3) 9% of the students did not increase in confidence, as they were already confident in applying collaborative approaches. The three most frequently used strategies for managing conflict were identifying the root cause of the problem, actively listening, and being specific and objective in explaining their concerns. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Highlights: What are the main findings? The Urbanite project developed a unified open-source simulation platform applied to four diverse European cities, effectively addressing specific mobility challenges in each city. The integration of simulation, advanced visualizations, decision support tools, and machine learning modules significantly enhances the decision-making process in urban planning. What is the implication of the main finding? Policymakers can utilize these AI-driven tools to make more informed, data-supported decisions, improving urban mobility and sustainability The methodology can be adapted to other cities, demonstrating the scalability and flexibility of the Urbanite platform in various urban settings. To address the growing need for advanced tools that enable urban policymakers to conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of traffic management changes, the Urbanite H2020 project has developed innovative artificial intelligence methods. Among them is a robust decision support system that assists policymakers in evaluating and selecting optimal urban mobility planning modifications by combining objective and subjective criteria. Utilising open-source microscopic traffic simulation tools, accurate digital models (or “digital twins”) of four pilot cities—Bilbao, Amsterdam, Helsinki, and Messina—were created, each addressing unique mobility challenges. These challenges include reducing private vehicle access in Bilbao’s city center, analysing the impact of increased bicycle traffic and population growth in Amsterdam, constructing a mobility-enhancing tunnel in Helsinki, and improving public transport connectivity in Messina. The research introduces five key innovations: the application of a consistent open-source simulation platform across diverse urban environments, addressing integration and consistency challenges; the pioneering use of Dexi for advanced decision support in smart cities; the implementation of advanced visualisations; and the integration of the machine learning tool, Orange, with a user-friendly GUI interface. These innovations collectively make complex data analysis accessible to non-technical users. By applying multi-label machine learning techniques, the decision-making process is accelerated by three orders of magnitude, significantly enhancing urban planning efficiency. The Urbanite project’s findings offer valuable insights into both anticipated and unexpected outcomes of mobility interventions, presenting a scalable, open-source AI-based framework for urban decision-makers worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Indian information technology (IT) sector is traditionally known for delivering IT and business process management (BPM) services to clients across the globe. To ensure the longevity of this client and service provider relationship, Indian IT organizations have made significant client-specific investments and actively engaged them in offshore development activities. One of the outcomes from such investments can be seen in terms of the very high maturity standards that Indian IT organizations currently exhibit in the context of IT–BPM service delivery. In recent times, these organizations are also undertaking offshore projects around emerging technologies. Such projects, especially those related to artificial intelligence (AI), are largely centred around the automation of client-focused BPM services. Given their relative nascency, such projects are primarily led by the AI research units that are rapidly diffusing across Indian IT organizations. In this study, we rely on a four-month-long ethnography to explore a client and vendor (or service-provider) relationship as manifested through one such AI research unit of an Indian IT organization situated in Bengaluru, India. Our objective from this study is to understand how these new offshore AI projects affect the longevity of the relationship between clients and the Indian IT service providers. Given the nature of emerging technology workflows, our findings indicate a tilt more towards meeting client-side expectations than that of vendors in these projects. We portend that this can potentially disrupt the longevity of the client–vendor relationship in the Indian IT services sector, and, therefore, both the clients and vendors must attend to the peculiarities of offshore emerging technology projects to mitigate such disruptions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The rise in extreme weather events due to climate change challenges the balance of supply and demand for high-quality agricultural products. In Taiwan, greenhouse cultivation, a key agricultural method, faces increasing summer temperatures and higher operational costs. This study presents the innovative AI-powered greenhouse environmental control system (AI-GECS), which integrates customized gridded weather forecasts, microclimate forecasts, crop physiological indicators, and automated greenhouse operations. This system utilizes a Multi-Model Super Ensemble (MMSE) forecasting framework to generate accurate hourly gridded weather forecasts. Building upon these forecasts, combined with real-time in-greenhouse meteorological data, the AI-GECS employs a hybrid deep learning model, CLSTM-CNN-BP, to project the greenhouse’s microclimate on an hourly basis. This predictive capability allows for the assessment of crop physiological indicators within the anticipated microclimate, thereby enabling preemptive adjustments to cooling systems to mitigate adverse conditions. All processes run on a cloud-based platform, automating operations for enhanced environmental control. The AI-GECS was tested in an experimental greenhouse at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, showing strong alignment with greenhouse management needs. This system offers a resource-efficient, labor-saving solution, fusing microclimate forecasts with crop models to support sustainable agriculture. This study represents critical advancements in greenhouse automation, addressing the agricultural challenges of climate variability. © 2024 by the authors.},

Aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the project aims for a 50% reduction in traffic accidents by 2030.The AI4PublicPolicy initiative introduces the Virtual Policy Management Environment (VPME) platform. VPME utilizes ML, Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and chatbots to empower the policy development lifecycle. Citizen feedback is integrated through workshops and surveys, fostering a citizen-centric approach. The Genoa pilot program demonstrates VPME's capabilities. ML models analyse historical accident and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to predict future high-risk areas. These predictions inform resource allocation and targeted interventions for pedestrian crossings and school walking routes ("Pedibus"). Dashboards visualize the model outputs, allowing users to assess risk levels and predict accident occurrences. Future improvements include incorporating additional data sources (demographics, real-time traffic) for enhanced model accuracy. Citizen engagement played a vital role. Co-creation workshops facilitated stakeholder participation in defining Use Cases, User Stories, and project objectives. Discussions focused on integrating data from environmental, traffic, and citizen reporting systems with VPME solutions. Participants evaluated the project approach and provided valuable feedback. The project highlights the potential of AI and citizen collaboration for data-driven policymaking.

	abstract = {In recent years, AI and ML have been widely adopted to improve efficiency of manufacturing, especially for faster decision-making in quality assurance processes. The lack of training data is a key obstacle when implementing deep learning (DL) for automated quality control. We show how transfer learning (TL) reduces the amount of data required to train convolutional neural networks (CNN) for recognizing production failures from images. We trained 114 DL models using three different CNN architectures. 38 of those models were trained from scratch, while 76 models used pretrained ResNet50 and VGG19. We found that the pretrained ResNet50 and VGG19 models needed up to 89.3 % less training data while still delivering accuracy comparable to from scratch trained CNNs as measured by F-score. Transfer learning also allowed for training of the high-quality models using only 352 images per class, while traditional training required 3,277 images per class. Furthermore, TL increased the prediction accuracy of the models by over 10% reducing the training time by up to 78%. We found that TL offered a better performance with less data recommending its use for similar DL-projects in quality control. However, we recommend using the maximum amount of data possible, since the reduction of data volume and training time will eventually decrease prediction quality.  © 2024 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Information and automation technologies play a pivotal role in achieving cyber-physical integration within Construction 4.0. In this transformed landscape, the evolution of the construction management paradigm carefully considers the enhancement of business models and organizational structures to prioritize stakeholders’ well-being, environmental sustainability, and heightened resilience. A significant challenge lies in effectively managing and coordinating a myriad of multi-source and heterogeneous entities using information and automation technologies. The key obstacle is synchronizing these elements based on cyber-physical interoperation to optimize multiple objectives seamlessly. Hence synchronization emerges as a crucial factor for orchestrating and sustaining harmonious relationships among multiple entities or activities within a delimited spatial-temporal framework. This ensures seamless and aligned coordination throughout dynamic processes. Therefore, this paper presents a strategic roadmap for the synchronized construction management, derived from a thorough analysis of fundamental elements in Construction 4.0, aimed at advancing the current construction management practices. Moreover, to articulate this synchronization approach systematically, an Orthogonally Synchronized Digital Twin (SDT) model with regular expression is formulated, built upon the proposed roadmap for reshaped construction management. This study provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the construction industry, including architects, engineers, project managers, and policymakers. The findings guide decision-making on digital twin adoption in construction, supporting practitioners to enhance efficiency and improve outcomes, offering a roadmap for industry advancement towards human-centrality, sustainability, and resilience. Future research should focus on validating the proposed roadmap and SDT model in real-world scenarios, exploring synergies between AI and digital twins, and investigating advanced technologies for holistic smart cities management. © 2024 The Authors},

Moreover, some other studies further proposed the use of blockchain technology to secure data, provide transparency in data analysis, and also keep track of all collaborations within open science platforms. Despite the importance of AI and blockchain technology in open science platforms, no study, to the best of our knowledge, has implemented and discussed the benefits of using both technologies together or how blockchain can enhance AI systems in open science. Therefore, to address this research gap, this study presents a newly developed open science platform that harnesses the power of AI and blockchain technologies to promote and foster a culture of sharing and seamless collaboration among universities worldwide. This platform was then validated through focus group analysis from the European University for Customised Education (EUNICE) partners, which is the project context of this present study. The findings revealed that the use of AI and blockchain enabled researchers and institutions to share open science more effectively. Specifically, the use of AI features in Open REUNICE enhanced data management processes, particularly by improving metadata accuracy, searchability and reusability, thereby addressing critical needs in research workflows. Additionally, the use of Blockchain was found to play a critical role in addressing legal challenges and enhancing user trust. © 2025, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The successful penetration of government, corporate, and organizational IT systems by state and nonstate actors deploying APT vectors continues at an alarming pace. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks continue to pose significant challenges for organizations despite technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based defense mechanisms. While AI has enhanced organizational capabilities for deterrence, detection, and mitigation of APTs, the global escalation in reported incidents, particularly those successfully penetrating critical government infrastructure has heightened concerns among information technology (IT) security administrators and decisionmakers. Literature review has identified the stealthy lateral movement (LM) of malware within the initially infected local area network (LAN) as a significant concern. However, current literature has yet to propose a viable approach for resource-efficient, real-time detection of APT malware lateral movement within the initially compromised LAN following perimeter breach. Researchers have suggested the nature of the dataset, optimal feature selection, and the choice of machine learning (ML) techniques as critical factors for detection. Hence, the objective of the research described here was to successfully demonstrate a simplified lightweight ML method for detecting the LM of APT vectors. While the nearest detection rate achieved in the LM domain within LAN was 99.89%, as reported in relevant studies, our approach surpassed it, with a detection rate of 99.95% for the modified random forest (RF) classifier for dataset 1. Additionally, our approach achieved a perfect 100% detection rate for the decision tree (DT) and RF classifiers with dataset 2, a milestone not previously reached in studies within this domain involving two distinct datasets. Using the ML life cycle methodology, we deployed K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), DT, and RF on three relevant datasets to detect the LM of APTs at the affected LAN prior to data exfiltration/destruction. Feature engineering presented four critical APT LM intrusion detection (ID) indicators (features) across the three datasets, namely, the source port number, the destination port number, the packets, and the bytes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of lightweight ML classifiers in detecting APT lateral movement after network perimeter breach. It contributes to the field by proposing a non-intrusive network detection method capable of identifying APT malware before data exfiltration, thus providing an additional layer of organizational defense.

	abstract = {The existence of software problems in IoT applications caused by insufficient source code, poor design, mistakes, and insufficient testing poses a serious risk to functioning and user expectations. Prior to software deployment, thorough testing and quality assurance methods are crucial to reducing these risks. This study advances the field of IoT-based software quality assessment while also showcasing the viability and benefits of incorporating AI methods into Software Defect Prediction (SDP), particularly the Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) and the War Strategy Optimisation (WSO) algorithm. These efforts are essential to maintain the dependability and performance of IoT applications given the IoT’s rising significance in our linked world. The chosen keywords, such as Software defect prediction, IoT, KELM, and WSO, capture the multidimensional nature of this novel technique and serve as an important source of information for upcoming study in this area. One of the main issues that needs to be addressed in order to overcome the difficulties of developing IoT-based software is how time and resource-consuming it is to test the programme in order to ensure its effectiveness. Software Defect Prediction (SDP) assumes a crucial function in this context in locating flaws in software components. Manual defect analysis grows more inefficient and time-consuming as software projects become more complicated. This research introduces a fresh method to SDP by utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to address these issues. The suggested methodology includes the War Strategy Optimisation (WSO) algorithm, which is cleverly used to optimise classifier hyperparameters, together with a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for SDP. The main objective is to improve softw. This innovative combination, grounded in previous studies [1, 2], promises superior capabilities in predicting software defects. Notably, it represents the inaugural endeavor to integrate the WSO algorithm with KELM for SDP, introducing a unique and advanced approach to software quality assessment. The proposed methodology undergoes rigorous evaluation using a diverse set of real-world software project datasets, including the renowned PROMISE dataset and various open-source datasets coded in Java. Performance assessment is conducted through multiple metrics, including Efficiency Accuracy, Reliability, Sensitivity, and F1-score, collectively illuminating the effectiveness of this approach. The outcome of our experiments underscores the potency of the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine coupled with the War Strategy Optimization algorithm in enhancing the accuracy of SDP and consequently elevating defect detection efficiency within software components. Remarkably, our methodology consistently outperforms existing techniques, registering an average increase of over 90% in accuracy across the parameters examined. This promising result underscores the potential of our approach to effectively tackle the challenges associated with IoT-based software development and software defect prediction. In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to the field of IoT-based software quality assessment, introducing an innovative methodology that substantially bolsters accuracy and reliability in SDP. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {Background/Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has traditionally been used for quantitative analysis using explicit data. However, much of the information critical to decision making remains undocumented and is not stored in a structured way. This study explores the integration of AI, specifically ChatGPT, into Theory of Constraints (TOC) Thinking Process (TP) tools. Method: In this study, we applied ChatGPT to a real-world IT project management case using a variety of research methods, including international literature analysis, observation, and personal experience. The use of the TOC TP allowed us to understand the decision-making process of ChatGPT and to systematically explore its advantages and limitations in creating logical trees of TOC TP. Results: ChatGPT significantly enhanced efficiency and depth in TOC TP data collection and analysis, effectively addressing logical leaps for more coherent structures. It also promoted deeper analytical thinking and aided root cause identification. The integration of ChatGPT into the TOC TP process led to faster decision-making, reduced bias, and clearer analysis. Challenges of ChatGPT including the need for human oversight, specific TOC TP training, and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion: This study provides an initial investigation into the use of ChatGPT in TOC TP tools. The results suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool for organizations seeking to improve their decision making and performance. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the full potential of AI in TOC TP. © 2024 Sciendo. All rights reserved.},

The research was conducted based on a comprehensive survey encompassing a sample of 473 SMEs and large Slovenian enterprises. Methods: To validate the observed differences, statistical analysis, specifically the Mann–Whitney U test, was employed. Results: The results confirm the presence of statistically significant differences between SMEs and large enterprises across multiple dimensions of AI support in project management. Large enterprises exhibit on average a higher level of AI adoption across all five AI utilization dimensions. Specifically, large enterprises scored significantly higher (p < 0.05) in AI adopting strategies and in adopting AI technologies for project tasks and team creation. This study’s findings also underscored the significant differences (p < 0.05) between SMEs and large enterprises in their adoption and utilization of AI technologies for project management purposes. While large enterprises scored above 4 for several dimensions, with the highest average score assessed (mean value 4.46 on 1 to 5 scale) for the usage of predictive Analytics Tools to improve the work on the project, SMEs’ average levels, on the other hand, were all below 4. SMEs in particular may lag in incorporating AI into various project activities due to several factors such as resource constraints, limited access to AI expertise, or risk aversion. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for targeted strategies to enhance AI adoption in SMEs and leverage its benefits for successful project implementation and strengthen the company’s competitiveness. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The classification of galaxies has significantly advanced using machine learning techniques, offering deeper insights into the universe. This study focuses on the typology of galaxies using data from the Galaxy Zoo project, where classifications are based on the opinions of non-expert volunteers, introducing a degree of uncertainty. The objective of this study is to integrate Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering with explainability methods to achieve a precise and interpretable model for galaxy classification. We applied FCM to manage this uncertainty and group galaxies based on their morphological characteristics. Additionally, we used explainability methods, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), to interpret and explain the key factors influencing the classification. The results show that using FCM allows for accurate classification while managing data uncertainty, with high precision values that meet the expectations of the study. Additionally, SHAP values and LIME provide a clear understanding of the most influential features in each cluster. This method enhances our classification and understanding of galaxies and is extendable to environmental studies on Earth, offering tools for environmental management and protection. The presented methodology highlights the importance of integrating FCM and XAI techniques to address complex problems with uncertain data. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In an era marked by rapid technological progress, the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly evident across various sectors, including local governments. These governmental bodies are progressively leveraging AI technologies to enhance service delivery to their communities, ranging from simple task automation to more complex engineering endeavours. As more local governments adopt AI, it is imperative to understand the functions, implications, and consequences of these advanced technologies. Despite the growing importance of this domain, a significant gap persists within the scholarly discourse. This study aims to bridge this void by exploring the applications of AI technologies within the context of local government service provision. Through this inquiry, it seeks to generate best practice lessons for local government and smart city initiatives. By conducting a comprehensive review of grey literature, we analysed 262 real-world AI implementations across 170 local governments worldwide. The findings underscore several key points: (a) there has been a consistent upward trajectory in the adoption of AI by local governments over the last decade; (b) local governments from China, the US, and the UK are at the forefront of AI adoption; (c) among local government AI technologies, natural language processing and robotic process automation emerge as the most prevalent ones; (d) local governments primarily deploy AI across 28 distinct services; and (e) information management, back-office work, and transportation and traffic management are leading domains in terms of AI adoption. This study enriches the existing body of knowledge by providing an overview of current AI applications within the sphere of local governance. It offers valuable insights for local government and smart city policymakers and decision-makers considering the adoption, expansion, or refinement of AI technologies in urban service provision. Additionally, it highlights the importance of using these insights to guide the successful integration and optimisation of AI in future local government and smart city projects, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of communities. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this innovation report, we present the vision of the PINK project to foster Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) advanced materials and chemicals (AdMas&Chems) development by integrating state-of-the-art computational modelling, simulation tools and data resources. PINK proposes a novel approach for the use of the SSbD Framework, whose innovative approach is based on the application of a multi-objective optimisation procedure for the criteria of functionality, safety, sustainability and cost efficiency. At the core is the PINK open innovation platform, a distributed system that integrates all relevant modelling resources enriched with advanced data visualisation and an AI-driven decision support system. Data and modelling tools from the, in large parts, independently developed areas of functional design, safety assessment, life cycle assessment & costing are brought together based on a newly created Interoperability Framework. The PINK In Silico Hub, as the user Interface to the platform, finally guides the user through the complete AdMas&Chems development process from idea creation to market introduction. Guided by two Developmental Case Studies, the process of building of the PINK Platform is iterative, ensuring industry readiness to implement and apply it. Additionally, the Industrial Demonstrator programme will be introduced as part of the final project phase, which allows industry partners and especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to become part of the PINK consortium. Feedback from the Demonstrators as well as other stakeholder-engagement activities and collaborations will shape the platform's final look and feel and, even more important, activities to assure long-term technical sustainability. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper elucidates an approach that utilizes generative artificial intelligence (AI) to develop alternative architectural design options based on local identity. The advancement of AI technologies has increasingly piqued the interest of the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management industry. Notably, the topic of "visualization"has gained prominence as a means for enhancing communication related to a project, especially in the early phases of design. This study aims to enhance the ease of obtaining design images during initial phases of design by drawing from multiple texts and images. It develops an additional training model to generate various design alternatives that resonate with the identity of the locale through the application of generative AI to the façade design of buildings. The identity of a locality in cities and regions is the capacity for the cities and regions to be identified and recognized as a specific area. Among the various visual elements of urban and regional landscapes, the front face of buildings may play a significant role in people's aesthetic perception and overall impression of the local environment. The research proposes an approach that transcends the conventional employment of three-dimensional modeling and rendering tools by readily deriving design alternatives that consider this local identity in commercial building remodeling. This approach allows for financial and temporal efficiency in the design communication phase of the initial architectural design process. The implementation and utilization of the proposed approach's supplementary training model in this study proceeds as follows: (i) image data are collected from the target area using open-source street-view resources and preprocessed for conversion to a trainable format; (ii) textual data are prepared for pairing with preprocessed image data; (iii) additional training and outcome testing are performed using varied text prompts and images; and (iv) the ability to generate building façade images that reflect the identity of the collected locale by using the additional trained model is determined, as evidenced by the findings of the proposed application method study. This enables the generation of design alternatives that integrate regional styles and diverse design requirements for buildings. The training model implemented in this study can be leveraged through weight adjustments and prompt engineering to generate a greater number of design reference images, among other diverse approaches. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The realm of digital twins is experiencing rapid growth and presents a wealth of opportunities for Industry 4.0. In conjunction with traditional simulation methods, digital twins offer a diverse range of possibilities. However, many existing tools in the domain of open-source digital twins concentrate on specific use cases and do not provide a versatile framework. In contrast, the open-source digital twin framework, OpenTwins, aims to provide a versatile framework that can be applied to a wide range of digital twin applications. In this article, we introduce a re-definition of the original OpenTwins platform that enables the management of custom simulation services and the management of FMI simulation services, which is one of the most widely used simulation standards in the industry and its coexistence with machine learning models, which enables the definition of the next-gen digital twins. Thanks to this integration, digital twins that reflect reality better can be developed, through hybrid models, where simulation data can feed the scarcity of machine learning data and so forth. As part of this project, a simulation model developed through the hydraulic software Epanet was validated in OpenTwins, in addition to an FMI simulation service. The hydraulic model was implemented and tested in an agricultural use case in collaboration with the University of Córdoba, Spain. A machine learning model has been developed to assess the behavior of an FMI simulation through machine learning. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {This paper draws from the experience of the 3-year, Horizon 2020 project, AI4PublicPolicy, and examines the essential actions public municipalities should take to adequately prepare for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their policy making processes under the scope of the five pilot cities involved in the project. The study explores a range of issues including organisational, technological, and ethical aspects. It also underlines the importance to understand local environments, involve stakeholders, evaluate the relevance and the availability of the data, assess the technological readiness, improve internal capacities and assure legal and ethical compliance. In order to promote transparency and cultivate public trust, the document also emphasizes the significance of elaborating on user-centric, agile and stable AI-based tools and solutions, such as dashboards of Explainable AI (XAI) services. Municipalities may pave their way towards automated, transparent and citizen-centric development of public policies by handling the challenges of AI deployment with the help of the current framework. © Author(s) 2024.

Therefore, the value that can be derived from spatio-temporal data is diluted due to management costs. We propose a new data management flow using various metadata and common programs for spatio-temporal data utilization. Traditionally, various spatio-temporal data processing have been implemented and processed according to each spatio-temporal data. We defined spatio-temporal data structure metadata and performed data processing based on metadata using a common data processing program. Furthermore, we automated the generation of data structure metadata by combining our data skeleton recognition method and generative AI model. Using this flow, we expect to improve the sustainability of utilizing spatio-temporal data. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {Agile Requirements Change Management (ARCM) in Global Software Development (GSD) posed significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of project requirements and the complexities of distributed team coordination. One approach used to mitigate these challenges and ensure efficient collaboration is the identification and prioritization of success factors. Traditional Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods, such as the Best-Worst Method (BWM), had been employed successfully to prioritize success factors. However, these methods often failed to capture the inherent uncertainties of decision-making in a GSD. To address this limitation, this study integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (FBWM) to enhance prioritization accuracy and decision support. We propose a model for comparing the prioritization outcomes of human expert assessments and LLM-generated decisions to evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of machine-generated decisions relative to those made by human experts. The findings indicate that the LLM-driven FBWM exhibit high reliability in mirroring expert judgments, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to support strategic decision-making in ARCM. This study contributed to the evolving landscape of AI-driven project management by providing empirical evidence of LLMs’ utility in improving ARCM for GSD. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

The first objective of this paper is to concisely survey the state-of-the-art of fair-AI methods and resources, and the main policies on bias in AI, with the aim of providing such a bird’s-eye guidance for both researchers and practitioners. The second objective of the paper is to contribute to the policy advice and best practices state-of-the-art by leveraging from the results of the NoBIAS research project.

The majority of these documents contain information about transactions/events (e.g., payments, hirings, appointments, project assignments) that occur in the frame of Public Administration and concern specific agents (citizens, businesses, public servants etc.). However, the actual transaction data is not adequately modeled at the metadata or provided only in an unstructured way through the pdf documents. This paper proposes an approach to extract and model the transactional data available in DIAVGEIA as Event Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKG). The approach uses ECKG models to represent the data and proposes a process, that leverages AI/ML/LLM techniques in order to generate the ECKG from the documents. This approach considers events as first-class entities for knowledge representation and works towards adopting a data-centric event-native mindset in data management of the public administration compared to the existing document-centric paradigm. This in turn can be beneficial for the public administrations in order facilitate real-time decisions making but can also increase transparency and accountability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Learning and using technology in the workplace are essential for a company’s commitment to the sustainable development of its resources. Finding competent engineers who can handle information communication technologies (ICTs) is a challenge for companies. Currently, however, the ability to use these technologies is limited to technicians with specialized training, and not everyone can engage in development. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that equity in the use of technology has not yet been realized. This study aims to analyze, based on actual cases, the necessary conditions and mechanisms for people with diverse experiences and circumstances, not limited to engineers, to participate in ICT development to address human resource diversity. The use of technology such as low-code platforms (LCPs) that have recently emerged on the market has shown that nonprofessional engineers without programming training can participate in development projects. This research will be useful to managers in advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategies in their workplaces and contribute to organizational research regarding new trends in technology use by individuals: low codability.

Addressing the practical requirements of urban refined managment, the utilization of Mixed Reality (MR) technology for interactive progress management in construction projects is instrumental in enhancing project management efficiency. However, current MR software and hardware has flaws when dealing with the interactive visualization of large-scale and highly detailed Building Information Models (BIM). Real-Time, continuous, and smooth visualization of complex BIM models remains a challenge, limiting the practical application of related technologies. This paper proposes a cloud-client decoupling architecture for complex BIM model interactive visualization in miniaturization and lowcost MR devices. The approach in this paper provides a feasible technological path for high-performance rendering of complex BIM models within the existing MR software and hardware environment.

	abstract = {This book describes a new methodology for planning and delivering projects and products. HYPERID (Hyper Inter-Methodological Delivery) is suitable for any type of project - from developing AI-powered software to building a skyscraper - regardless of whether those projects have typically been delivered using agile or sequential methods to date. HYPERID is particularly suitable for "fixed time/fixed price" projects and can address the core project delivery needs of today's enterprises that primarily revolve around predictability and successful delivery in terms of cost, time, and added value while remaining agile. HYPERID, as a hybrid methodology, makes use of some existing approaches and complements them with additional processes, structures, best practices, and behaviors. The methodology was developed because previous process models - classic (such as the waterfall method) and agile (including Scrum) cannot meet some of today's key requirements. HYPERID can be used to address the following core needs: reliable predictability and rapid planning, iterative and value-added results, and on-time and on-budget execution. The book is structured in such a way that the reader can learn all the necessary skills for planning and implementation according to the HYPERID methodology. The explanation of the individual steps is supplemented by background information, examples, and both best and bad practices. HYPERID is aimed at project managers and product managers, as well as executives who want to improve the implementation of their projects or products. On the HYPERID website you will find further information, updates, and tools for practical implementation. © Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE, part of Springer Nature 2024. All rights reserved.},

One of the main pillars of 6G technology, Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), integrates communication and sensing capabilities into a single system. ISAC can significantly enhance ITS by improving the way vehicles and infrastructure interact, leading to more efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation networks. Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide aerial data to complement ground-based sensors in ITS, leading to more comprehensive traffic analyses. The synergy between UAVs, ITS and ISAC has the potential to create smarter, safer, and more efficient transportation networks. In ISAC systems, various sensing modes can be utilized to enhance the performance of both sensing and communication functions. Each mode has its specific applications, advantages, and limitations. In this work, we propose a learning based sensing mode selection for ISAC in ITS. By applying learning-based approaches to sensing mode selection in ISAC, ITS can enhance the operational effectiveness across diverse environments. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In strategic and radical innovation, the degree of uncertainty and the amount of complexity is much higher compared to ‘business as usual’. Therefore, idea management systems are often used to support such innovation processes. An interesting question is what we can learn from studying data in such idea management systems and what potential implications we can derive from the innovation management literature. In this study, we were allowed to access and analyze data from the same idea management system used in 11 radical innovation projects from the years 2012–2018. Our analysis unravels 8 findings that in different ways nuance or challenge current research on innovation management. Finally, we discuss how the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in idea management systems can support innovation team members in increasing the innovation potential of the ideas that are elaborated. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In modern software development, programmers typically choose between two main types of coding environments: Incremental Programming Environments (IPEs), such as the Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) interpreter IPython and the Jupyter Computational Notebook, and Integrated (text-based) Development Environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio Code. IPEs excel in providing immediate feedback for iterative development, testing, and debugging, making them ideal for fields like data science and AI. However, their typically linear and isolated interface struggles with managing the complexity of larger software projects. Conversely, traditional IDEs support extensive project management and debugging tools suited for complex applications but lack the interactive and incremental nature of IPEs. This paper reports on an ongoing investigation and design of a hybrid environment that combines benefits of IPEs and IDEs and the programming styles they naturally support. Central to our design is a graph structure representing code fragments as nodes and code structure as edges. By considering various types of nodes and relationships (e.g. for representing class membership, execution order, documentation, and dependencies) we can facilitate aspects of both incremental programming (in IPEs) and complexity management (in IDEs). We demonstrate our approach with a prototype, called Incremental Graph Code (IGC), by presenting its architecture and a showcase. We demonstrate IGC’s functionality and discuss its potential advantages over existing environments. Key features include advanced code visualization, modular and incremental development, and complexity management. IGC aims to provide a unified, extensible, and flexible development environment that bridges the gap between different styles of programming. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

We shift the focus from AI as a “worker” to ask whether, how, and when AI can also “manage” human workers who perform such tasks. Focusing on the context of crowd science, we find examples of algorithmic management (AM) in five key functions highlighted in prior organizational literature: task division and task allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning. These applications benefit from the instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities of AI, and reflect several more general underlying functions such as matching, clustering, and forecasting. Quantitative comparisons show that projects using AM are larger and more likely to be associated with platforms than projects not using AM, pointing to potentially important contingency factors. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research on algorithmic management in scientific research. © 2024},

	abstract = {Digital interactive accessibility services must enable human interaction with the media content beyond consumption, ensuring that people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content and contribute to it. All these new types of interactions are also a field of study in audiovisual translation (AVT) and media accessibility (MA), as translation is a form of human-computer interaction (HCI) (O'Brien, Translation Spaces 1:101-122, 2012). Therefore, the role of technology in AVT/MA is a key aspect not only in the process of creation, but also for distribution, delivery, and consumption. This tendency is expected to grow in the coming years as "technology is also the basis of tools to translate or adapt content and tools to consume content" (Matamala in Accessibilitat i traducció audiovisual, 2019). The progressive transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, with the irruption of recent technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), is opening up innovative forms of communication and interaction for users in the digital world. Yet, challenges in relation to intellectual property rights (IPR) management in AVT/MA remain a major concern (Orero et al., 2023; Serrat-Roozen & Oncins, 2023). The following chapter presents the results of a series of focus groups held with professionals and researchers from the different fields of the AVT and MA in the frame of the European project MediaVerse. This three-year project was aimed at designing and testing a framework to allow professionals and laymen to publish multimedia content that may be easily shared. Results presented highlight user's needs and expectations from AVT/MA professionals in relation to copyright management, through the use of blockchain technology to protect and recognise IPR for professionals in these fields. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Methods: This research is based on a random sample of 326 large enterprises and SMEs in Slovenia, with an entrepreneur completing a questionnaire in each enterprise. Results: Findings suggest that there are no significant differences between male and female entrepreneurs in Slovenia regarding various aspects of AI-supported entrepreneurial management practice including the following: AI-supported entrepreneurial culture, AI-enhanced leadership, adopting AI to reduce employee workload, and incorporating AI tools into work processes. The widespread integration of AI into entrepreneurship marks a transition to a business landscape that values inclusivity and equity, measuring success through creativity, strategic technology deployment, and leadership qualities, rather than relying on gender-based advantages or limitations. Our research also focused on the identification of gender differences in path coefficients regarding the impact of the four previously mentioned aspects of AI on employee engagement. While both genders see the value in using AI to alleviate employee workload, the path coefficients indicate that female entrepreneurs report higher effectiveness in this area, suggesting differences in the implementation of AI-integrated strategies or tool selection. Male entrepreneurs, on the other hand, appear to integrate AI tools into their work processes more extensively, particularly in areas requiring predictive analytics and project scheduling. This suggests a more technical application of AI in their enterprises. Conclusions: These findings contribute to understanding gender-specific approaches to AI in enterprises and their subsequent effects on employee engagement. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in computing have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled healthcare technologies. AI-assisted clinical decision support (CDS) integrated into electronic health records (EHR) was demonstrated to have a significant potential to improve clinical care. With the rapid proliferation of AI-assisted CDS, came the realization that a lack of careful consideration of socio-technical issues surrounding the implementation and maintenance of these tools can result in unanticipated consequences, missed opportunities, and suboptimal uptake of these potentially useful technologies. The 48-h Discharge Prediction Tool (48DPT) is a new AI-assisted EHR CDS to facilitate discharge planning. This study aimed to methodologically assess the implementation of 48DPT and identify the barriers and facilitators of adoption and maintenance using the validated implementation science frameworks. The major dimensions of RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and the constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) frameworks have been used to analyze interviews of 24 key stakeholders using 48DPT. The systematic assessment of the 48DPT implementation allowed us to describe facilitators and barriers to implementation such as lack of awareness, lack of accuracy and trust, limited accessibility, and transparency. Based on our evaluation, the factors that are crucial for the successful implementation of AI-assisted EHR CDS were identified.

The preprocessing sequence incorporated categorical encoding, and feature scaling to standardize inputs to the model. We implemented and benchmarked predictive models-Random Forest Regressor, Neural Network, Support Vector Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Model efficacy was quantified using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score. Our results indicate that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, exhibit good accuracy in capturing complex nonlinear dependencies within project data. This study demonstrates the significance of meticulous feature engineering and selection in machine learning-driven project management, providing a detailed comparative analysis of model performances for delay prediction.

Specifically, a hybrid architecture of neural networks is employed to predict the code churn ratio, the proportion of code lines changed relative to the total number of code lines in a project. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0213, demonstrating high accuracy in forecasting code churn. By combining the strengths of convolutional layers for feature extraction and recurrent layers for sequence modeling, the hybrid neural network architecture offers a robust and effective framework for churn prediction.

	abstract = {International entrepreneurship competencies in the era of rapidly developing artificial intelligence focus more than earlier on stepping out of one's comfort zone, asking the right questions, assessing the reliability of information sources, and developing cross-cultural teamwork readiness. The purpose of this research is to prepare students for collaborative learning situations where generative artificial intelligence tools have become widely available. The main research question is: What are the challenges in different types of entrepreneurial team-based action learning projects in the context of artificial intelligence? Learning concepts based on collaborative learning and improving the international networking readiness of students are presented. Practical implications of time zone differences, trust building and conflict management in international teams are analysed based on the experience of X-Culture projects. We compare the opportunities and challenges of applying generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Co-pilot and Google Gemini Advanced when developing learners' own international business ideas to learning from international teamwork to assist foreign start-ups in entering new markets. Gaps in skills to apply human collaboration for critically assessing artificial intelligence summary answers and identifying possible hallucinations when comparing new potential foreign markets were revealed. Artificial intelligence applications can be used to form global student teams based on the similarity of entrepreneurial self-development visions of team members. Still, experimenting with prompts in these applications can also enhance readiness to compare the pros and cons of different international entrepreneurship concepts and intelligent questioning skills for coaching and consulting. Students can chat with AI in a role-playing manner that helps them understand how to manage cultural differences in international entrepreneurship teams. Online action learning driven by tasks of start-ups is an essential tool in the entrepreneurial learning approach that prepares students to understand the value and limitations of generative artificial intelligence tools for international entrepreneurship. This paper contributes to understanding the challenges in action learning of students for international entrepreneurship and ways to overcome these challenges in the era when generative artificial intelligence tools are changing learning and international entrepreneurship practices. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This novel method utilizes prediction models, often used in different fields, to predict energy-related patterns, providing a unique and specialized viewpoint. The synergy of academicians, AI experts, and industry professionals in the energy sector has resulted in the creation of customized AI models to optimize operational efficiency. By customizing various AI models to suit the distinct attributes of energy scenarios and datasets, these models are positioned to transform energy management methods. This study examines the utilization of AI models to enhance energy efficiency in power generation in Malaysia. The project seeks to predict future power consumption in various sectors, analyze growth rates, and identify sectors with investment potential by developing a Linear Regression model. In addition, a thorough power plan is developed using the estimated energy usage. A comparative analysis is performed to determine the most appropriate model for this particular scenario, which will improve decision-making in the energy sector. The results of this study present promising opportunities for further investigation. By broadening the study's focus to encompass a broader array of AI models and their assessment of performance, it is possible to gain useful insights for predicting power generation. Furthermore, the integration of real-time data streams and the inclusion of feedback loops in the AI models could improve their ability to adapt and increase their accuracy as time progresses.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The purpose of this research study is to investigate the potential roles that artificial intelligence (AI) could play in improving risk management methods throughout financial organizations. To identify, evaluate, and mitigate financial risks, we investigate a variety of artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, natural language processing procedures, and predictive analytics. Artificial intelligence models can deliver real-time insights and prediction skills that traditional approaches frequently lack. These capabilities are achieved through the analysis of historical data, transaction patterns, and market trends. Within the scope of this research project, the effectiveness of AI-driven approaches is compared to that of traditional risk management tactics. Particular attention is paid to enhancements in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. According to the findings, artificial intelligence dramatically improves risk detection and management, providing financial institutions with more powerful tools to tackle regulatory obstacles and uncertainties. This research highlights the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence in redefining risk management frameworks, thereby paving the way for financial risk mitigation measures that are more proactive and data-driven. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The evolution beyond the Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems is expected to exploit different advanced radio access techniques, such as distributed multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO), together with an extensive support of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions for different aspects of network optimization. In addition, these systems will also benefit from the evolution of edge computing technologies through the availability of computing and storage capabilities that will span from the radio access network nodes to the cloud, forming an edge-to-cloud compute continuum. The availability of these features will provide the beyond 5G and 6G networks with an increased flexibility for deploying the different AI/ML-based optimization functionalities, trading-off aspects such as the delay requirements, the computational complexity or the availability of data for feeding the AI/ML models. In this context, this paper takes as a reference the evolved edge computing architecture of the VERGE project and focuses on the possibilities to deploy on top it an AI/ML model for D-MIMO power control.

	abstract = {Efficient maintenance of transportation tunnels (TT) is paramount for infrastructure safety and longevity. Predictive maintenance approaches offer significant advantages, enabling proactive interventions and extended asset lifespan. However, traditional tunnel diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of deep learning-based methods for defect segmentation in TT images, specifically focusing on ethical, sustainable, and secure implementations within the MIRET (Management and Identification of the Risk for Existing Tunnels) framework, also considering the future constraints of the EU's AI Act. Traditional tunnel diagnostics are slow. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offers a promising solution for automated defect segmentation. The MIRET project aims to develop a robust risk management framework for tunnels using ARCHITA, a multi-dimensional mobile mapping system. Integrating deep learning-based defect segmentation with ARCHITA's data transforms tunnel inspection and risk assessment. Applying deep learning in MIRET raises regulatory and ethical concerns under the EU's AI Act, which emphasizes fairness, transparency, and accountability. Potential biases in training data could compromise safety. The AI Act identifies certain categories as high-risk. Among these, AI systems used for managing critical infrastructure stand out. Major construction works, including tunnels and bridges, are crucial elements within the infrastructure. For tunnels, the inspection phase and subsequent vulnerability assessment are critical. MIRET-Tunnel AI, software implementation from MIRET, based on convolutional neural networks, plays a crucial role in detecting defects in tunnel lining structures, contributing to efficient asset management.  © 2024 IEEE.},

This work aims to investigate how the use of AI, comprising computer vision, ML, and NLP influence financial decisions in contrast to traditional forms of expert authoritative opinion. The research analyses how well AI performs when predicting stock prices and improving the financial decisions of an organization through technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and a statistical model. This research compares different approaches of AI, especially Machine learning Models like Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recursive Autoencoders, as well as Traditional method such as Random Forest (RF), for forecast the appreciation of stocks and sentiment analysis. The work results also show the advantage of LR compared to LSTM in terms of price prediction, and Recursive Autoencoders compared to Random Forest in several parameters. Moreover, experiments with the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on sentiment analysis can be considered promising but in real-life projects, the results are not very satisfactory. Cross-sectional research and hypothesis testing show that AI, especially expert systems and computer vision, enhances the effectiveness of financial decision-making with machine learning being of value to risk and cash management.

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is one of the most important and powerful statistical tools for measuring, monitoring and improving the quality of processes and products. Adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently gained increasing attention in the SPC literature. This paper presents a combined use of SPC and AI techniques, which results in a novel and efficient process monitoring tool. The proposed prediction control chart, which we call pred-chart, may be regarded as a more robust and flexible alternative (given that it adopts the median behavior of the process) to traditional SPC tools. Besides its ability to recognize patterns and diagnose anomalies in the data, regardless of the sample scenario, this innovative approach is capable of performing its monitoring functions also on a large scale, predicting market scenarios and processes on massive amounts of data. The performance of the pred-chart is evaluated by the average run length (ARL) computed through Monte Carlo simulation studies. Two real data sets (small and medium sets) are also used to illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed control chart for prediction of continuous outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

	abstract = {Personalized medicine is a new concept that transforms health care in the context of tailoring strictly towards the needs of an individual patient, using genetic, molecular, and clinical data. This new wave has been brought about by the advancement of genomics, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). AI comes into play while analyzing massive datasets, identifying different patterns, and enabling predictive modelling for disease outcomes. Genomic medicine makes potent use of the Human Genome Project by relying on AI technologies to process and interpret enormous genetic data. AI enhances genome sequencing, thereby making it possible to be more sensitive and specific in detecting genetic variations that predispose or cause diseases. In pharmacogenomics, AI optimizes drug prescriptions based on genetic profiles to make therapies more effective and personalized. AI, particularly ML andDL, helps in the advanced genomic analysis in clinical genomics, going beyond what is allowed by the traditional bioinformatics to study genomic patterns that wouldn't have been possible under previous standards. Advanced genomic analysis paves the way for precision medicine, providing insights in terms of cancer diagnosis, optimising treatment, and prognosis by the inspection of complex genomic data including SNVs, structural variations, and CNVs. This paper briefly surveys the integration of AI in personalized medicine and genomic research; it would most likely revolutionize healthcare outcomes. As this paper surveys the following, it is apparent that including AI in personal medicine highly enhances genomic study and treatment personalization. The promise of such an advancement includes improved patient outcomes through precised diagnostics, tailored therapies, and optimized disease management strategies. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a collection of algorithms, tools and solution models that offer entrepreneurs a platform for managing and systemising their SMEs and business operations. Recently, AI opened new venues for smart activities and cost-effective solutions, saving time and money for start-ups and established enterprises. Advanced AI tools use high-efficiency algorithms such as machine learning to assess markets, evaluate product and service prices, and reduce maintenance costs. AI has radically disturbed many industries and sectors, offering opportunities to and allowing entrepreneurs to innovate and develop smart solutions in a competitive market. However, this disruption presents new challenges for entrepreneurs in dealing with AI technologies and establishing their 'smart' businesses. Investing in AI requires proper planning and understanding of the risks and challenges of applying new technologies and tools. Therefore, entrepreneurs must acquire the necessary skills and build competent teams of talents or experts to support them in maximising their returns and minimising risks. This paper presents a real-life scenario about some of the challenges faced by business enterprises in general and property businesses in particular. An AI-based innovation model for a real estate business comprising six primary services: Data analysis and strategy, Finance, Legal, Property Development, Property management, and Facility management has been introduced. This paper covers some of the entrepreneurial activities and AI-based solutions developed to improve the quality of their operations, manage their business processes, and maintain effective service delivery. Generative AI or Gen AI has significantly impacted many impressive real-life applications, delivering real value to many sectors, including finance, real estate, business management, research and development (R&D) projects, and entrepreneurial operations. Gen AI uses machine learning and neural network algorithms trained using big data text, images, audio and video. This paper introduces the main Gen AI types and covers real-life examples of applying Gen AI techniques to property business problems. It presents our GPT-based AI-powered property consultant application that uses GPT to help property developers, investors, and professionals, offering them solutions to business challenges such as property design and conversion options. If necessary, the user prompts the application, which responds with options for possible solutions like design solutions or converting office buildings or commercial properties to multiple residential flats and houses. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {Weed detection is very important in modern agriculture, and timely and fast identification of weeds helps to reduce crop losses that have a positive effect on the yield. The classical methods of weed management involve manual weeding or broadcast spraying with herbicide, and both have laborious, expensive, and dismaying effects on the environment. The demand has never been higher for automatic weed detection systems in agriculture. Abstract: This project aims to build an automated weed detection system with YOLOv8, one of the most state-of-the-art object detection algorithms that excels in real-time accuracy. The system utilizes high-resolution drone and camera images of fields to pinpoint the specific plants growing in a crop, enabling more selective herbicide application and minimizing the need for manual labor from cropping operators. The design of YOLOv8 ensures high-speed and high-precision performance, making it ideal for use as a real-time detection system in the field. We train our model on a home-grown dataset of approximately 8k crop and weed images (gm), incorporating additional data augmentation for enhanced robustness. We will assess performance using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP). © 2024 IEEE.},

Considering that AI may generate risks and cause harm, the approach for evaluating the newly developed AI and decision support systems (DSS) will vary from domain to domain. This paper presents the approach the European Union (EU) funded project IntelliLung is currently implementing in the healthcare domain. The IEC 62559-2:2015 methodology was used to structure the IntelliLung AI-DSS requirements and define key performance indicators relevant for the functional parts of the system (data integration, pre-processing, AI modelling). "Ethics-by-design"and "Transparent AI design"methodologies have been used for the IntelliLung AI-DSS implementation. The compliance requirements analysis has shown that the trustworthiness of AI-DSS relies on a wide set of measures including information and communication security, explainable AI algorithms, data governance and privacy considerations, as well as risk-management throughout the entire lifecycle of AI-DSS as a high-risk AI system. © 2024 IEEE.},

Our poster gives an insight into the project’s progress. It presents the innovative low-fidelity prototype based on the “E-Gesetzgebung”, a platform for the electronic legislative process. Our prototype provides legislators with AI-generated context-related text suggestions during the RIA process and offers an initial assessment of the potential impacts and possible mitigation measures. Through this automation of knowledge management, our solution aims to improve the efficiency and quality of the equality-oriented RIA and thus contribute to promoting gender equality in legislation. If developed and integrated into the “E-Gesetzgebung”, we expect our approach to increase RIA executions and create a higher degree of relevance and impact in promoting gender equality in German legislation. Due to generative AI’s versatility, the system could even be extended to other RIAs, enabling support in assessing the impact of other topics and goals declared by the German government. © 2024 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

Early identification and management of the illness can be crucial—in fact, it might be the secret for healing. Most scientists and researchers concentrate on machine learning approaches that accurately identify diseases for vast and complicated datasets, as their primary goal is to foresee the sickness in its earliest phases. Such methods are then applied to support healthcare. This work uses a variety of machine learning methods, including Random Forest (RF), SVM, KNN Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naïve Bayes (NB), to recognize heart illnesses early and minimize consequences. The goal of the project is to build an artificial intelligence-based apparatus for the detection of coronary artery disease by utilizing machine learning methods. We show whether machine learning can be used to forecast an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

	abstract = {With the increasing demand for electricity and the wide application of new energy sources, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in power grid construction management has gradually become prominent. By analyzing actual cases and current research results, this paper discusses the important role and challenges of AI in power grid construction management. In terms of role, AI shows its unique advantages through intelligent operation and maintenance management, equipment health monitoring and intelligent energy management. Intelligent operation and maintenance management system can monitor the status of power equipment in real time and predict potential faults, thus improving the operation efficiency of power grid. At the same time, the application of AI in energy management is expected to optimize the power production plan, better integrate distributed energy and energy storage systems, and promote the efficient use of renewable energy. However, AI faces a series of challenges in power grid construction management. Among them, data privacy and security are urgent problems to be solved, especially when sensitive data are involved in power system. The technical integration problem is also an important challenge. Due to the diversity of power equipment standards, the integration of AI system becomes more complicated. In addition, attention should be paid to social, economic and employment impacts, and relevant laws and regulations and ethical standards should be formulated to ensure the rational application of AI in power grid construction management. The research in this paper provides a combination of theory and practice for the development of AI in power grid construction management, and provides a reference for future policy formulation and technological innovation. © 2024 SPIE.},

Effective governance and resource management are imperative for organizations aiming to optimize performance. This research uses AI techniques and the COBIT 2019 framework to optimize IT governance in software development projects. Quantitative methods are employed to analyze factors causing scheduling delays in projects using machine learning algorithms, focusing on identifying factors that impact project timelines. Data from a previous study on software cost estimation involves 120 projects from 42 organizations. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing data and scale features. Feature engineering is conducted to identify critical factors affecting project completion times. We evaluate various machine learning models for robust analysis of project delay factors, and we find that CatBoost provides reliable project duration predictions. Model performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, R2, and MAPE. Integrating AI with COBIT 2019 enhances project duration estimation accuracy and strengthens IT governance.

	abstract = {Effective inventory management requires a comprehensive capability to forecast demand and optimize stock levels, traditionally reserved for human expertise. Emerging AI methods, while providing effective solutions through deep learning models and data analytics, often lack the flexibility to incorporate dynamic market insights and real-time data. By leveraging the diverse capabilities of multiple dynamically interacting large language models (LLMs), we can overcome these limitations and develop a new class of AI-driven inventory management systems. This paper presents a multi-agent framework comprising a project manager agent, a sales forecasting agent, and an inventory manager agent, which autonomously collaborate to address inventory management challenges. The agents dynamically adjust inventory plans and maintain product availability through self and mutual corrections. Simulation results demonstrate a significant increase in the inventory turnover ratio, reduced shipping costs and holding fees, and a substantial decrease in total cost, all while maintaining a zero stockout rate. Our framework showcases the potential of synergizing the intelligence of LLMs, the precision of statistical modeling, and the dynamic collaborations among diverse agents, opening novel avenues for automating and optimizing supply chain management. © 2024 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

	abstract = {The planning poker estimation technique encour-ages all team members to participate equally, which is essential in the training of future software engineers. By proposing a coordination scheme based on the experience and knowledge of the team members, it enforces the common ownership of effort estimation. Thus, it is crucial that all members contribute to the process [10]. However, given the personal factors that could affect team interaction dynamics, the contributions of team members could not be equally distributed, hindering the goal of the technique. Ensuring the equal participation of team members sets a challenge not only in the professional context but also for training future software developers and team managers [18] that must facilitate team collaboration. Hence, it is vital to detect team members' contributions in order to value collaboration in a development team. In this article, we present the analyses of the interventions of 13 groups of students from the Computer Engineering course at the University of Valparaiso during a user story estimation activity using planning poker. The experimental setup involved computer science undergraduate students, performing a learning activity regarding the Planning Poker estimation technique. The students' interventions were classified according to a human expert following a collaboration framework. Subsequently, they were classified using ChatGPT 4 using the Zero Shot technique in order to compare the automatically generated labels with those provided by human experts. The type of classification used was binary to determine whether or not the intervention analysed was a contribution. The analysis focused on evaluating the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT in the contribution classification task, considering the model's ability to correctly identify the different types of interventions. The results of this comparison demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatGPT and its potential to assist in real-time evaluation and analysis tasks.

	abstract = {In recent years, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Knowledge Management (KM) has led to transformational changes. These changes have significantly enhanced traditional KM processes. To identify how AI technologies improve and reshape knowledge processes, this study conducted a systematic literature review. The review identified AI technologies suitable for each of Probst's building blocks, which outline the eight central KM processes. The research reveals a wide range of AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing and chatbots such as ChatGPT. These technologies can be applied in different domains and introduce innovative approaches to improve KM processes. Based on the AI technologies analysed, this study proposes a four-stage model to support the documentation and application of best practices and lessons learned. The model is designed to enhance the knowledge development process and aims to document and secure key project developments in the long term. A further objective was to analyse which KM process is most affected by chatbots. The findings indicate that chatbots have the potential to transform the use of knowledge in organisations. They act as facilitators by breaking down existing barriers, foster an open culture of knowledge sharing, streamline workflows and increase the accessibility of knowledge. The study also examines the broader changes that AI will bring to KM and forecasts the sixth generation of KM. It draws on Bencsik's (2021) evolutionary and revolutionary perspectives that specifically forecast this next generation. The study shows that AI not only enhances existing KM processes but also has the potential to fundamentally disrupt traditional methods and approaches. These findings underline the need for future research to explore the effective integration and scalability of AI technologies in real-world KM environments. This will help ensure that their long term impact and potential benefits are fully understood across different industries and organisational contexts. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.},

	abstract = {Health holds significant importance in our lives, hence the adage 'Health is Wealth' resonates deeply. This study endeavors to develop a diabetes risk management system incorporating thyroid levels and additional parameters. The major research has been conducted in the field of Data Science by collecting, dividing, and preprocessing patient data. It can be asserted that the dataset is completely unique and not available on any platform across the globe. Patient data sourced from Trinity Hospital in Nagpur, Maharashtra, has been compiled to construct a bespoke dataset for the research. The AI-inspired Health Meter project aims to modernize diabetes risk assessment by utilizing key health indicators such as age, hypertension, heart disease history, blood glucose level, BMI, and thyroid readings. This innovative method offers a comprehensive view of an individual's health without the need for invasive blood sampling. Especially tailored for older patients, who often have a multitude of tests already under their belt, the project extends the convenience of at-home monitoring.

	abstract = {Software requirements are the foundation of a successful software development project, outlining the customer's expectations for the software's functionality. Conventional techniques of requirement prioritization present several challenges, such as scalability, customer satisfaction, efficiency, and dependency management. These challenges make the process difficult to manage effectively. Prioritizing requirements by setting criteria in order of importance is essential to addressing these issues and ensuring the efficient use of resources, especially as software becomes more complex. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to these challenges through algorithms like Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Optimization, and Natural Language Processing. Despite the availability of reviews on conventional prioritization techniques, there is a notable gap in comprehensive reviews of AI-based methods. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of AI-driven requirements prioritization techniques within Agile methodologies, covering 32 papers published between 2010 and 2024. We conducted a parametric analysis of these techniques, identifying key parameters related to both the prioritization process and specific AI methods. Our findings clarify the application domains of various AI-based techniques, offering crucial insights for researchers, requirement analysts, and stakeholders to choose the most effective prioritization methods. These insights consider dependencies and emphasize the importance of collaboration between stakeholders and the development team for optimal results. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

This responsibility falls, in a large part, to the effectiveness of Project Management Offices (PMOs) running these large projects. Additionally, there are rapid advances being made in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). At present, there is lack of wide-spread use cases in wide array of industries, however, Gartner's research (2023) indicates that in a decade, over 80% of standard project management tasks will be carried out using AI, machine learning and other digital advances. Project management offices (PMOs) are a feature of large banking and financial service organisations and offer many services, including portfolio prioritisation, project governance standards, tracking project risks and budget consumption and monitoring internal or external influences. A critical role of the PMO is to move the organisation closer to its strategic goals and report the achievement of enterprise objectives to shareholders and stakeholders.

	abstract = {Purpose: Accounting information systems are mainly rule-based, and data are usually available and well-structured. However, many accounting systems are yet to catch up with current technological developments. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) in financial accounting is often applied only in pilot projects. Using AI-based forecasts in accounting enables proactive management and detailed analysis. However, thus far, there is little knowledge about which prediction models have already been evaluated for accounting problems. Given this lack of research, our study aims to summarize existing findings on how AI is used for forecasting purposes in financial accounting. Therefore, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview and agenda for future researchers to gain more generalizable knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify existing research on AI-based forecasting in financial accounting by conducting a systematic literature review. For this purpose, the authors used Scopus and Web of Science as scientific databases. The data collection resulted in a final sample size of 47 studies. These studies were analyzed regarding their forecasting purpose, sample size, period and applied machine learning algorithms. Findings: The authors identified three application areas and presented details regarding the accuracy and AI methods used. Our findings show that sociotechnical and generalizable knowledge is still missing. Therefore, the authors also develop an open research agenda that future researchers can address to enable the more frequent and efficient use of AI-based forecasts in financial accounting. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the rapid development of AI algorithms, our results can only provide an overview of the current state of research. Therefore, it is likely that new AI algorithms will be applied, which have not yet been covered in existing research. However, interested researchers can use our findings and future research agenda to develop this field further. Practical implications: Given the high relevance of AI in financial accounting, our results have several implications and potential benefits for practitioners. First, the authors provide an overview of AI algorithms used in different accounting use cases. Based on this overview, companies can evaluate the AI algorithms that are most suitable for their practical needs. Second, practitioners can use our results as a benchmark of what prediction accuracy is achievable and should strive for. Finally, our study identified several blind spots in the research, such as ensuring employee acceptance of machine learning algorithms in companies. However, companies should consider this to implement AI in financial accounting successfully. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted that provided a comprehensive overview of AI-based forecasting in financial accounting. Given the high potential of AI in accounting, the authors aimed to bridge this research gap. Moreover, our cross-application view provides general insights into the superiority of specific algorithms. © 2023, Marko Kureljusic and Erik Karger.},

	abstract = {Software Maintenance and Evolution (SME) is moving fast with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models (LLM). Researchers have already started automating various activities of the SME workflow. Un-derstanding the requirements for maintenance and development work i.e. Requirements Engineering (RE) is a crucial phase that kicks off the SME workflow through multiple discussions on a proposed scope of work documented in different forms. The RE phase ends with a list of user stories for each unit task and usually created and tracked on a project management tool such as GitHub, Jira, AzurDev, etc. In this research, we collaborated with Bell Mobility to develop a tool 'Geneus' (Generate UserSory) using GPT-4-turbo to automatically create user stories from software requirements documents. Requirements documents are usually long and contain complex information. Since LLMs typically suffer from hallucination when the input is too complex, this paper proposes a new prompting strategy, 'Refine and Thought' (RaT), to mitigate that issue and improve the performance of the LLM in prompts with large and noisy contexts. Along with manual evaluation using RUST (Readability, Understandability, Specificity, Technical-aspects) survey questionnaire, automatic evaluation with BERTScore, and AlignScore evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the results of the 'Geneus' tool. Results show that our method with RaT performs consistently better in most of the cases of interactions compared to the single-shot baseline method. However, the BERTScore and AlignScore test results are not consistent. In the median case, Geneus performs significantly better in all three interactions (requirements specifi-cation, user story details, and test case specifications) according to AlignScorebut it shows slightly low performance in requirements specifications according to BERTScore. Distilling RE documents requires significant time & effort from the senior members of the team through multiple meetings with stakeholders. We believe automating this process will certainly reduce additional loads off the software engineers and increase the ultimate productivity allowing them to utilize their time on other prioritized tasks.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Smart plugs, which remotely control various appliances, can significantly reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings by about 20% when effectively scheduled using AI techniques. Designing these AI pipelines involves numerous steps and variables, requiring collaboration and shared knowledge among designers. A Decision Support System (DSS) can facilitate this process. This paper introduces the Explorative Decision Support System (EX-DSS), which extends the classical DSS framework. The EX-DSS integrates an Explorative Management Subsystem to provide project-specific recommendations and a Data Quality (DQ) module to validate user inputs, ensuring clarity and enhancing information sharing. The EX-DSS architecture framework was tested through a software prototype designed to create AI pipelines for forecasting smart plug loads. The study found that using the EX-DSS improves the quality of suggestions, making them more problem-specific and resulting in a more personalized and meaningful user experience, with a significant potential to reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {How to address the obstacles of efficiency and cost control within project cost management? These limitations would be an issue because they are not suitable for the refined management requirements and would increase the amount of labor for the personnel. In this investigation, artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to improve the efficient and accurate refined amount in the cost management, for engineering, based on the refined construction cost information. Therefore, a significant amount of data of the construction engineering project was acquired. Key moments were the data cleaning, data preprocessing and data quality improvement. Furthermore, the machine learning algorithm was utilized to formulate the refined cost prediction model. For identifying the cost trend and probably other rules, the data mining technology was adopted. The cost model was further optimized by using the linear regression method in order to support the risk management and decision-making. The results of this study showed that the achievement for the refined construction amount of this paper was 93% to 98%. The application of AI in the refined amount of engineering cost management was able to significantly improve the cost prediction, and the refined cost control of engineering in the expeditious and accurate model. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {In modern urban environments, efficient waste management is a significant challenge. This paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart trash bin system that integrates ultrasonic sensors, weight sensors (simulated), and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize waste collection processes. The system utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers and ESP32-CAM modules to monitor the fill levels and types of waste. Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to the waste surface, while potentiometers simulate the weight of the trash. An AI algorithm processes images captured by the ESP32-CAM to classify the waste, enhancing the accuracy of the monitoring system. Data from the sensors and AI analysis are transmitted via Wi-Fi to a centralized server, where it is stored and visualized using Oracle APEX dashboards. The sensor's software can update its status to "full"based on the weight and level readings; a mobile application developed with MIT App Inventor also allows users to update the status of the trash bins via a mobile device. This enables city waste management authorities to make informed decisions, reducing operational costs and improving environmental sustainability. The proposed system demonstrates significant potential in enhancing urban waste management efficiency through real-time data acquisition, processing, and intelligent decision-making.

	abstract = {Decentralized energy solutions, particularly microgrids, have proven transformative in ensuring reliable, equitable, and sustainable access to energy in remote regions of India. This paper presents the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in a microgrid project implemented in the Billenahosalli and Lakshmanapura Tribal Hamlets, Mysore District, India, led by NIE-CREST. The AI-ML-driven system enhances the microgrid's decision-making processes, optimizing energy generation, consumption, and resource allocation in real-time, even under adverse weather conditions. Key AI-ML techniques such as ARIMA and LSTM models have been used to forecast weather conditions, enabling proactive energy management and resource switching between solar and biodiesel-based systems. By implementing reinforcement learning (RL), the system autonomously switches between energy sources based on predicted weather patterns, ensuring continuous electricity supply. IoT components integrated into the system provide real-time data on energy production and consumption, allowing for data-driven decisions and efficient energy use. Results demonstrate that the AI-ML-empowered microgrid consistently meets the hamlets' energy demands, generating 11,680 units of electricity annually. This energy production replaces an equivalent amount of energy from coal, resulting in a reduction of 11,680 kg of CO2 emissions and saving 46 tons of coal per year. The inclusion of energy storage, through hydrogen generation via electrolysis, ensures that surplus energy is effectively utilized. By incorporating advanced AI protocols, the microgrid improves the quality of life for residents by providing a sustainable, reliable energy supply, particularly during peak energy consumption periods and festivals.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The ways that traffic is now managed frequently result in longer wait times, more pollution, and worries about road safety. With an emphasis on the cutting-edge You Only Look Once (YOLO) object identification method, this review paper offers a comprehensive solution for traffic optimization employing real-time traffic analysis, intelligent signal control, and state-of-the-art AI-powered object recognition. With the help of the YOLO algorithm, our suggested system tracks and monitors cars in real time, allowing for data-driven traffic analysis. Our solution reduces congestion and improves vehicle flow by optimizing traffic signal timings through real-time data. It is possible to respond to shifting traffic circumstances more quickly with this proactive approach to traffic management. The initiative tackles a number of important issues. It provides exact and real-time vehicle tracking, providing accurate traffic analysis, by utilizing the YOLO method. In addition, our eco-friendly strategy lessens the negative effects of traffic on the environment by lowering energy use and pollutants. The interface is easy to use, providing traffic officials with the necessary tools to make well-informed judgments for more effective traffic control.

To manage tourist pictures from customers’ views, online travel notes are first utilized as examples. Next, tourism texts’ keywords are extracted using Python big data and AI technology to understand consumers’ perceptions of scenic spot preferences, tourism facilities and services, and social and cultural customs. The findings demonstrate that, when compared to the conventional tourism brand development strategy, the integrated development strategy based on the AI big data platform can not only increase the effectiveness of managing tourists’ perceptions of scenic locations but can also encourage the common development of national sports event components and intelligent tourism image management. Several sports tourist boutique picturesque locations have also been built along B&R following years of development of intelligent tourism and sports projects, which will strengthen the effect of multicultural exchanges. © 2024 – IOS Press.

	abstract = {With the G-20 prioritising the development of a solution that will address the challenges of cross-border payment, a lot of focus and research has been exploring ways of using a decentralised ledger technology (DLT) solution to address this challenge. Some of the issues that have been identified with the DLT option are interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) implementing DLT have also been acknowledged by experts as having the potential to address some of these challenges. Given the focus on CBDCs as an alternative technology that could address the shortcomings of traditional cross-border payment systems, some of the design challenges that are impacting their widespread adoption have come to the fore. Considering that early CBDC projects were in reaction to emerging digital currencies and therefore were meant to address the domestic needs of each implementing jurisdiction, the lack of a common development framework for developing the technology contributed to the challenge of the interoperability of the various CBDCs across jurisdictions and has impacted it’s full-scale adoption as an alternative to existing cross-border payment systems. With specific focus on regulatory frameworks used by various jurisdictions and also an identified challenge of CBDCs, this paper explores Customer Due Diligence (CDD) regulation as a mechanism for combating anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT). As part of the efforts to adapt cross-border payment system into a world of distributed ledgers relying on smart contracts, it reviews the impact of divergent regulatory frameworks that limit the interoperability of CBDCs. It discusses some of the existing techniques in place for conducting CDD, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and how they fit with the new technology.

Based on the possibilities offered by AI and metadata, we propose, in this paper, a model for processing media objects using AI and metadata.

In this study, we base use the pedagogical resources of the Cheikh Hamidou Kane Digital University's training courses. The proposed model enables us to extract contextual information, classify metadata and categorize multimedia objects for future use. The application of our model makes it possible to classify educational data by category or activity (consultation, TD, TP, project) according to pedagogical objectives; to automatically add metadata to a media object using the model; to manually annotate a media object by pedagogical actors; and finally, to create a search engine based on metadata. © 2024 Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2024.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue that human resource development (HRD) needs to embrace and include futures and foresight learning (FFL) as a new addition to its field of theorising and practice. The question to consider is: How can FFL become a new feature of HRD? A key part of the authors’ argument is that the inclusion of FFL will enable HRD to add to the success of any organisation and make a vital contribution to the management of people at work. Design/methodology/approach: This paper firstly considers some of the debates surrounding the meaning of HRD. The authors suggest that instability of the time serves to disturb any comforts that have been created in HRD and that there is a need to consider how there might be different futures for what we still call HRD in research, practice and praxis. This paper then considers how FFL might become one possibility for expanding the existing boundaries of HRD. The authors characterise futures and foresight as a learning process, which provides new but complementary features to what is already considered as HRD. This paper will show how FFL can lead to organisation's success and the way this can be achieved. Findings: There is a wide variety of meanings of the term HRD; however, HRD is still cast as a “weakened profession” which has to play a subservient role to others in the workplace. Over the last 15 years, the expansion of the meaning of HRD has been seen as evidence of its evolving and emerging nature and development based on a co-creation with other disciplines. This creates a space for FFL, defined as an ongoing learning process to find predictable, probable, possible and/or a variety of long-term futures. FFL embraces three key processes of scanning, futuring and reconfiguring, all of which contain a high potential for participants and others to learn as they proceed, providing outcomes at each stage. FFL has been shown to enhance organisation performance and success and HRD interventions can play a key part in implementation. This represents a significant opportunity for the HRD profession to move from weakness towards strength. Research limitations/implications: For HRD researchers, while FFL is not yet on its radar, the authors would argue that the uncertainties of the future require that more attention be given to what might lie ahead. Indeed, HRD researchers need to ask the question: What is the future of HRD research? In addition, if the authors’ call for FFL to be included in the practice of HRD, such practice will itself provide new pathways for HRD research. Further research questions might include: To what extent is FFL practiced in organisations and what role do HRD practitioners play in delivery? How does FFL impact on organisation behaviour and outcomes? What new products and services emerge from FFL? What new skills are required to deliver FFL? Can FFL enhance the status of HRD practitioners in the work place and its role in decision-making? and How can the HRD profession develop as a hybrid profession with respect to machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI)? Practical implications: FFL produces outcomes that have importance for strategy, HRD practitioner can learn to facilitate FFL by action learning and in leadership development programmes. FFL offers a significant opportunity to enhance the importance of HRD in organisations and beyond. FFL offers those involved in HRD a significant opportunity to transfer ideas into practice that have an impact on organisation sustainability. HRD can play a significant role in the design and delivery of ML and AI projects. Originality/value: This paper concludes with a call for embracing FFL as a challenging but important addition to how we talk about learning at work. The authors argue that FFL offers a significant opportunity to enhance the importance of HRD in organisations and beyond. At its centre, FFL involves learning by people, groups, organisations and machines and this has to be of concern to HRD. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents itself as a crucial tool for predicting postoperative complications, improving outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. This project employs the INSPIRE database to develop AI models for predicting ICU stay length for abdominal surgeries. The CRISP-DM methodology was applied for the selection, preprocessing, and analysis of patient data using machine learning. The models were evaluated using confusion matrices, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, the area under the curve (AUC), and ROC curve graphs. It was observed that the Random Forest and KNN models showed the best overall performance, standing out for their high precision and balance in classifying the duration of ICU stay. The analysis of feature importance using SHAP revealed that the most influential intraoperative parameters on the length of stay were estimated blood loss (ebl), heart rate (hr), inspired oxygen fraction (fio2), and positive end-expiratory pressure (peep). Machine learning models, especially Random Forest, proved to be an effective tool for predicting the length of ICU stay. This approach can significantly improve hospital resource management and patient care planning, enabling the early identification of those at risk for prolonged ICU stays and facilitating the implementation of preventive measures to improve clinical outcomes and reduce associated health care costs. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: In intensive care units (ICUs), accurate mortality prediction is crucial for effective patient management and resource allocation. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-2), though commonly used, relies heavily on comprehensive clinical data and blood samples. This study sought to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model utilizing key hemodynamic parameters to predict ICU mortality within the first 24 h and assess its performance relative to SAPS-2. Methods: We conducted an analysis of select hemodynamic parameters and the structure of heart rate curves to identify potential predictors of ICU mortality. A machine-learning model was subsequently trained and validated on distinct patient cohorts. The AI algorithm's performance was then compared to the SAPS-2, focusing on classification accuracy, calibration, and generalizability. Measurements and main results: The study included 1298 ICU admissions from March 27th, 2015, to March 27th, 2017. An additional cohort from 2022 to 2023 comprised 590 patients, resulting in a total dataset of 1888 patients. The observed mortality rate stood at 24.0%. Key determinants of mortality were the Glasgow Coma Scale score, heart rate complexity, patient age, duration of diastolic blood pressure below 50 mmHg, heart rate variability, and specific mean and systolic blood pressure thresholds. The AI model, informed by these determinants, exhibited a performance profile in predicting mortality that was comparable, if not superior, to the SAPS-2. Conclusions: The AI model, which integrates heart rate and blood pressure curve analyses with basic clinical parameters, provides a methodological approach to predict in-hospital mortality in ICU patients. This model offers an alternative to existing tools that depend on extensive clinical data and laboratory inputs. Its potential integration into ICU monitoring systems may facilitate more streamlined mortality prediction processes. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Reliable effort estimation is of paramount importance to software planning and management, especially in industry that requires effective and on-time delivery. Although various estimation approaches have been proposed (e.g., planning poker and analogy), they may be manual and/or subjective, which are difficult to apply to other projects. In recent years, deep learning approaches for effort estimation that rely on learning expert features or semantic features respectively have been extensively studied and have been found to be promising. Semantic features and expert features describe software tasks from different perspectives, however, in the literature, the best combination of these two features has not been explored to enhance effort estimation. Additionally, there are a few studies that discuss which expert features are useful for estimating effort in the industry. To this end, we investigate the potential 13 expert features that can be used to estimate effort by interviewing 26 enterprise employees. Based on that, we propose a novel model, called Fine-SE, that leverages semantic features and expert features for effort estimation. To validate our model, a series of evaluations are conducted on more than 30,000 software tasks from 17 industrial projects of a global ICT enterprise and four open-source software (OSS) projects. The evaluation results indicate that Fine-SE provides higher performance than the baselines on evaluation measures (i.e., mean absolute error, mean magnitude of relative error, and performance indicator), particularly in industrial projects with large amounts of software tasks, which implies a significant improvement in effort estimation. In comparison with expert estimation, Fine-SE improves the performance of evaluation measures by 32.0%-45.2% in within-project estimation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art models, Deep-SE and GPT2SP, it also achieves an improvement of 8.9%-91.4% in industrial projects. The experimental results reveal the value of integrating expert features with semantic features in effort estimation. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In Malaysia, approximately 70%-80% of recyclable materials end up in landfills due to low participation in Separation at Source Initiative. This is largely attributed to the public perception that waste segregation is a foreign idea, coupled with a lack of public knowledge. Around 72.19% of the residents are unsure about waste categorization and proper waste disposal. This confusion leads to apathy toward recycling efforts exacerbated by deficient environmental awareness. Existing waste classification systems mainly rely on manual entry of waste item names, leading to inaccuracies and lack of user engagement, prompting a shift towards advanced deep learning models. Moreover, current systems often fail to provide comprehensive disposal guidelines, leaving users uninformed. This project addresses the gap by specifically developing an AI-Powered Waste Classification System incorporated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), classifying waste technologically and providing environmentally friendly disposal guidelines. By leveraging primary and secondary waste image data, the project achieves a training accuracy of 80.66% and a validation accuracy of 77.62% in waste classification. The uniqueness of this project lies in its utilization of CNN within a user-friendly web interface that allows the user to capture or upload waste image, offering immediate waste classification results and sustainable waste disposal guidelines. It also enables users to locate recycling centers and access the dashboard. This system represents an ongoing effort to educate people and contribute to the field of waste management. It promotes Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), contributes zero waste, raises environmental awareness, and aligns with Malaysia's goals to increase recycling rates to 40% and reduce waste sent to landfills by 2025. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

	abstract = {This work of research determines the productivity of smart city schemes in the pursuit of achieving a similar urban development that can be sustainable. We designed a study consisting of a comparative case study of the different smart city projects in global history. Our objective was to assess the point that technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data had on some key urban management indicators, putting in focus energy efficiency, traffic congestion, and emergency response time. The paper has argued this issue through regression analysis, revealing an average welfare improvement of up to 16. It demonstrated 65% energy savings and an almost a quarter increase in electric vehicle share over the evaluated cities. Moreover, the next part of the article explores the factors that complicate the implementation of the projects, for example, technical difficulties, insufficient funds, and public opposition, getting assigned as difficult ones with a score of 7.5, 8.0, and 6. 5 correspondingly. This case examination is useful for discovering effective strategies to minimize the failure of smart city projects substantially. The strategies will include unifying data systems, developing strong public-private partnerships, and having an inclusion community program. Policymakers should prioritize increasing funding (importance score: Equipping a small engineering team with training materials (importance score: 8. 5) and enhancing public engagement (importance score: 9. Finally, as a result of blending these two concepts, cities can be more advanced in their structures and adept in their functions, as they tackle the hindrances and take advantage of these technologies. © 2024 IEEE.},

The complex nature of the SDLC process leaves plenty of scope for human error, which impacts the overall business cost. This paper introduces AI-Analyst, an AI-assisted framework developed using the transformer-based model with more than 150 million parameters to assist with SDLC management. It minimizes manual effort errors, optimizes resource allocation, and improves decision-making processes, resulting in substantial cost savings. The statistical analysis shows that it saves around 53.33% of costs in an experimental project. The transformer model has been trained with a uniquely prepared dataset tailored for SDLC through transfer learning. It achieved impressive results, with an accuracy of 91.5%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.3%, and an F1-score of 91.5%, demonstrating its high reliability and performance. The perplexity score of 15 further indicates the model's strong language understanding capabilities to retrieve relations from complex characteristics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The AI-Analyst framework represents a significant advancement in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SDLC, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for optimizing business processes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

AI and ML can be used in handling unfinalized criminal cases in India can be one of the possible ways of improving the functioning of the criminal justice system in this country. The approach to this project is to create an AI system that will filter through the open cases and then rank them according to complexity, time-sensitivity, prior performances, and location. Since priority in a case is explained through the use of a supervised learning based on selected set, then law enforcement as well as legal personnel are able to shift most of their attention to other significant cases. Despite feature engineering and data preprocessing being in the construction of the system from the data collected from the various sources such as court records. This means that there is than models such as; Random Forest, Apriori and Rule-Based in an effort to establish the most suitable model. Perhaps the application of this AI based mechanism to form priorities could aid India in better organization of resources and with the assistance of backlog decrease – the justice system in India.

It aims to assess how AI adoption in PM affects project efficiency. The study surveyed 159 project supervisors and specific project managers implementing projects from 7 industries in the Republic of Kazakhstan: software, green energy, engineering, construction, science, transport, and tourism. The research used variance and linear regression analyses to evaluate the relationship between AI adoption and project efficiency level measured by the Likert scale from 1 to 5 and test the associated hypotheses. The results show that AI adoption varies among industries, with software, construction, and scientific projects being the most active users. The study also found that the use of AI differed across eight project performance domains, with the stakeholder domain using voice technologies and process automation and the uncertainty domain using fewer tools. Projects with higher AI adoption rates showed higher efficiency scores (for example, in Software projects, the AI adoption rate is 3.2; the efficiency rate is 3.3), while those with lower efficiency levels (for example, in the Tourism industry, the AI adoption rate is 1.9; the efficiency rate is 2.2) showed the worst results. Decision-making systems, process automation, and voice technologies are the three most critical AI technologies PM professionals use to improve project efficiency. © Assel Kozhakhmetova, Almas Mamyrbayev, Aknur Zhidebekkyzy, Svitlana Bilan, 2024.},

	abstract = {The integration of data visualization, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) with human knowledge transfer across teams presents significant opportunities for managing the world's largest programs, commonly referred to as megaprojects. According to the Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management, megaprojects are characterized as “large-scale, complex ventures that typically cost $1 billion or more, take many years to develop and build, involve multiple public and private stakeholders, are transformational, and impact millions of people.” These projects often function as mega-systems marked by operational uncertainty, behavioral complexity, pluralistic decision-making, and external environmental volatility. Despite the fundamental role of uncertainty management in megaproject leadership, the project management literature offers limited coverage on this topic. Similarly, the visualization of uncertainties has not been extensively analyzed. In response to these gaps, this study introduces a new assessment framework designed to categorize and describe the dimensions of uncertainty in megaprojects. We developed an innovative megaproject uncertainty framework to use as a project assessment and management playbook for megaproject uncertainties. The framework was tested on historical case studies and ongoing megaprojects. This paper will discuss the development, application, and evaluation of the Megaproject Uncertainty Framework..

	abstract = {This paper presents state-of-the-art user localization technologies that can effectively assist the authorities and first responders to localize individuals during emergency and disaster scenarios. Localization is an essential tool that ensures preparedness, response, and coordination between first responders and impacted people. Many of these technologies employ artificial intelligence techniques to improve the localization accuracy using the information collected by a variety of sensing equipment such as sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless access points, cameras, and smart load meters. The paper also highlights the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies such as integrated sensing and localization, THz communications, satellite-based non-terrestrial networks, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that can modify the reflection properties of materials to enable device localization. These technologies are expected to play a key role in enabling emergency services. Other localization technologies include WiFi, Bluetooth, radio frequency identification, and long range wide area network. In addition, crowd sensing and smart meter-based non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques that are supported by deep learning and federated learning techniques are also presented in the context of device localization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces NILM for the first time as a useful technique that can provide information about the inhabitants' behaviour in residential and commercial buildings to assist in emergency and public safety applications. All the technologies reviewed in this paper can play an effective role in device localization, and are presented to serve as a foundation for researchers to further investigate and conduct research in this domain.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Estimates predict a global deficit of 4 million software engineers by 2025, further complicated by the software engineering (SE) industry's escalating use of artificial intelligence (AI). To tackle this issue, our research suggests that computer science (CS) curricula in middle and high schools need to be updated to incorporate SE industry segments that significantly employ AI. This strategic curriculum alignment is significant for preparing a workforce equipped to meet future industry demands. Our initial analysis involved reviewing nine international AI education guidelines to evaluate current methods for integrating AI into SE education. The findings indicated a pronounced lack of specific guidance connecting AI applications in the SE industry with educational content. To address this, we performed a systematic literature review of 12 research papers focusing on AI's role across the SE industry, followed by multiple rounds of inductive content analysis. An industry segment was deemed "essential" if it was referenced in 75% or more of the papers' findings. Through this method, we identified 10 essential SE industry segments for inclusion in CS education: software development, software maintenance, process improvement, software economics, knowledge management, project management, software testing, software security, quality assurance, and deployment and operations (DevOps). These findings led to the creation of the AI-USE (Artificial Intelligence Usage in Software Engineering) framework, which maps these 10 key segments to the predominant uses of SE in the industry as identified in the literature. Further inductive content analysis helped us develop subsegments for these essential areas. Ongoing framework development involves refining these subsegments and gathering feedback from industry and academic professionals. We anticipate that the fully developed AI-USE framework will significantly enhance SE education, equipping the next generation of software engineers with the AI proficiency required to address the industry’s evolving demands. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.},

	abstract = {Addressing violations of traffic laws is critical for ensuring public safety, encouraging responsible driving behavior, lowering economic costs, and minimizing transportation's environmental impact. It is imperative to implement punitive measures for traffic violations. An AI model can play a crucial role in monitoring and issuing fines to those who breach traffic regulations through the alerts. High resolution cameras and sensors captures vehicular movements, while the algorithms analyze the footage to detect infractions. Hence, a YOLO v8 Convolutional Neural Networks model is proposed for the traffic rules violation detection and management. The YOLO v8 model is trained to identify major five specific traffic violations starting with Wrong Way Violation, Red Light Crossing, Over Speeding, Triple Riding, and Helmet Less Driving. The model operates in real-time, providing immediate identification of violations, thereby contributing to the enhancement of enforcement system and road safety measures. A unique feature of this project is the integration of an automated alert system. This automated approach decreases the need for manual monitoring, improves the accuracy of violation detection, and provides a robust mechanism for monitoring roads. The system notifies the respective person through email alert when a violation is detected, enabling them to take immediate action.

	abstract = {The wireless communication systems of today rely to a large extent on the condition of the accessible channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and receiver. Channel aging, denoting the temporal and spatial evolution of wireless communication channels, is influenced by obstructions, interference, traffic load, and user mobility. Accurate CSI estimation and prediction empower the network to proactively counteract performance degradation resulting from channel dynamics, such as channel aging, by employing network management strategies such as power allocation. Prior studies have introduced approaches aimed at preserving high-quality CSI such as temporal prediction schemes, particularly in scenarios involving high mobility and channel aging. Conventional model-based estimators and predictors have historically been considered state-of-the-art. Recently, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the interest in developing models based on AI. Previous works have shown high potential of AI-aided channel estimation and prediction, which inclines the state-of-the-art title from model-based methods to be confiscated. However, there are many aspects to consider in channel estimation and prediction employed by AI in terms of prediction quality, training complexity, and practical feasibility. To investigate these aspects, this chapter provides an overview of state-of-the-art neural networks, applicable to channel estimation and prediction. The principal neural networks from the overview of channel prediction are empirically compared in terms of prediction quality. An innovative comparative analysis is conducted for five prospective neural netwoion horizons. The widely acknowledged tapped delay line (TDL) channel model, as endorsed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), is employed to ensure a standardized evaluation of the neural networks. This comparative assessment enables a comprehensive examination of the merits and demerits inherent in each neural network. Subsequent to this analysis, insights are offered to provide guidelines for the selection of the most appropriate neural network in channel prediction applications. © 2025 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

	abstract = {We propose and implement a task planning system that integrates a series of validated robotic instructions, deep learning models, and demonstration cases, into a larger structure using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which is commonly used in engineering project management. By organizing these small-scale solutions in a sequence based on temporal and resource dependencies, we use simulations and evaluation functions to select the optimal structure as the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). These SOPs are then used to train a generative AI, enabling it to mimic human experts in generating high-level structures according to real-world needs and perform minor parameter generalizations to address issues involving temporal dependencies, spatial relationships, and resource allocation. The generated high-level structures are gradually transformed into low-level operations to execute actual tasks. The system records the execution results for automatic or manual analysis, and the feedback is used to continuously improve the generative AI's output. Our work lays the foundation for further research on the innovative application of combining generative AI with WBS data in robotic task planning. https://github.com/NOMIzy/LLM-Project. © 2024 IEEE.},

Drawing from pedagogical theories and cognitive science, especially Leinenbach and Corey (2004)’s Universal Design for Learning, this study proposes a framework tailored to the unique needs and backgrounds of engineering students. The framework emphasizes active learning strategies, collaborative problem-solving, and real-world applications to engage learners in meaningful experiences with Generative AI concepts. The central learning context is a M.Sc. program in management engineering with a course/training opportunity in Machine Learning Fundamentals using Python based on Google Collab. The introduction of Generative AI is based on selected Google libraries for Python. Furthermore, this paper explores various instructional approaches and tools to scaffold students' understanding of Generative AI, including hands-on projects, case studies, and interactive simulations. It also addresses ethical considerations and societal implications associated with Generative AI deployment, encouraging students to critically reflect on the broader impacts of their technical decisions. Through a synthesis of pedagogical best practices and AI development principles, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on effective AI education for non-computer science disciplines. By embracing a holistic approach that integrates theory with practical application, educators can empower engineering students to harness the transformative potential of Generative AI while navigating its complexities responsibly and ethically. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.},

	abstract = {The world is currently going through a huge transition towards digitalization and sustainability. Sustainability focuses on responsible resource management and environmental preservation, whereas digitalization entails the conversion of many processes and systems into connected, digital forms. Energy management, which aims to offer clean and affordable energy solutions while minimising waste and environmental damage, is one of the important sectors garnering significant attention in this context. Energy management involves the methodical optimisation of energy use in a variety of contexts, including commercial and industrial facilities and residential settings. The energy metre, a tool used to measure electricity, gas, or other energy kinds, is essential to this project. Traditional energy metres are evolving into "smart"energy metres, which may send consumption data periodically or in real-time in addition to measuring energy usage. The usability of energy metres is considerably increased by this feature for both consumers and energy suppliers. Industry 4.0 refers to the fourth industrial revolution, which is characterised by the incorporation of digital technologies into manufacturing and industrial processes, in the broader context of business and technology. Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and automation are key technologies advancing this transformation. These technologies are essential for improving productivity, sustainability, and efficiency across sectors. A key component of increasing energy management practises is the Internet of Things (IoT). The internet of things (IoT) is a network of connected gadgets and sensors that can gather and send data. IoT-enabled devices are crucial to the real-time monitoring and management of energy use in the field of energy management. These gadgets are capable of collecting information from many sources, such as energy metres, and transmitting it for analysis and well-informed decision-making. An IoT-improved Automatic Metre Reading (AMR) system is shown in the study. Energy metres can be remotely read using AMR technology, eliminating the requirement for manual intervention. In this case, IoT technology enhances the capabilities of the AMR system by being easily incorporated into it. Wireless sensors and specialised communication protocols are used in the energy metres as part of this integration to enable real-time data monitoring and transfer. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (Al) technology into the workplace has become a focal point of discussion in recent years. While management scholars have typically advocated for an approach that augments rather than substitutes human labour, little consideration has been given to the potential drawbacks of human-AI augmentation strategies. Thus, this paper focuses on addressing employee deskilling that can arise from human-AI augmentation in the workplace. Drawing on insights from eight semi-structured interviews with experts across industry and academia, this paper details two key factors influencing managerial decision-making in augmentation projects and touches on the blurred lines between augmentation and substitution strategies—especially when augmentation erodes the satisfaction of human work. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

This research endeavors to delve into the utility of AI in managing engineering cost risks and to suggest appropriate warning and control approaches. By conducting a thorough literature review and case studies, the study identified and compared three AI models: the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), evaluating their performance against key metrics such as Cost Variance Ratio (CVR), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Risk Response Efficiency (RRE). The research methodology encompassed data collection and preprocessing, model training and validation, and comprehensive performance assessment. The findings revealed that the LSTM model achieved a minimum CVR of 1.1%, a maximum SPI of 1.03, and a remarkable risk response efficiency as fast as 12.5 minutes. The study concludes that LSTM significantly enhances the precision of engineering cost risk warnings, offering a novel insight and robust technical foundation for project management in the construction industry.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The design and development of an AI-Powered Video Surveillance System for Enhanced Intrusion Detection project aims to redefine today's conventional surveillance approaches by integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods for automated detection of threats in real-time. In particular, unlike the existing systems that require human monitoring, and which can result in inattention, missing possible strikes, or false alarms, the current application has the potential to increase the accuracy, efficiency, and responsiveness of intrusion detection in a number of unsecure environments, including businesses, public areas, and facilities. The use of computer vision methods and deep learning principles, such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, enables the system to analyze the feed from a live video and detect unusual activities. The AI solutions are trained on vast datasets to recognize multiple types of intrusions, including both physically and unusual behaviors, thereby reducing the amount of human monitoring and the number of false alarms. Additionally, the current video surveillance approach is not limited to monitoring the current filter but has a number of other features, including object tracking, facial recognition, and general behavioral analysis. The use of AI analytics allows the system to become more accurate through time and gives the current system an ability to learn and recognize new patterns. Overall, the proposed AI-powered video network is more solid, intelligent, and reliable, and allows it to eliminate strikes in unprotected areas and eliminate falsesures and unresponsive behavior.  © 2024 IEEE.},

However, managing Agile projects requires effective communication, collaboration, and decision-making. ChatGPT, a large language model, has the potential to enhance these aspects of Agile project management. In this chapter, we conduct a survey study to understand the perception of Agile project managers about adopting ChatGPT in their projects. Based on responses from 73 Agile professions in Nordic countries, we found that (1) in general, the perceived benefits offered by ChatGPT outweigh the perceived complexity required for its setup, (2) Agile professions are positive toward the adoption of ChatGPT on non-technical activities in Agile projects, and (3) administrative tasks involving meetings, emails, and technical writing are seen as the blue ocean, offering significant value with relatively lower setup complexity. We also discuss the limitations of ChatGPT in the Agile project context, such as bias, privacy concerns, and dependency on data quality. Our discussion provides insights into the potential applications of ChatGPT in Agile project management and recommendations for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Data-driven innovation has served as a pivotal element in technological advancement for more than a decade. However, the recent pandemic and the subsequent post-pandemic period have underscored the diverse needs facing industries today, from addressing supply chain challenges to adapting to hybrid work cultures. Additionally, the recent surge in generative AI has steered companies toward the development of enterprise data platforms. This shift underscores the urgent need to harness data more effectively, empowering businesses to navigate the evolving landscape and tackle these critical challenges. However, recent research in this direction—aiming to develop economical, timely, and scalable data platforms—has been notably scarce. This research presents the development of a scalable, cost-effective, and time-efficient data platform designed to support various data domains such as Data Analytics, Marketing, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Utilizing a case study with a simulation within a real-world organizational context, in the practical organizational setting of over the past four years, we integrated data into a central Lakehouse using Spark Delta to assess the platform’s capabilities. We have collected data using metadata-driven ingestion patterns using near real-time, batch, and Application programming interface (API). The platform leverages advanced technologies like Spark, Databricks, Kafka, Power BI, and cloud infrastructure to meet the high-performance demands of data management and analysis. The implementation results revealed the platform’s proficiency in processing data, performing intelligent analytics, and generating actionable insights efficiently. Its cost-effectiveness and impressive performance outcomes highlight the platform’s potential as an invaluable resource for organizations optimizing data assets. This platform also builds in short duration. This paper details the design, implementation, and benefits of our proposed data platform, illustrating its significance as a robust solution for enterprises leveraging data-driven decision-making.

	abstract = {While documenting Architectural Knowledge (AK) is crucial, it is frequently neglected in many projects, and existing manual tools are underutilized. Although undocumented, Archi-tecture Knowledge (AK) is dispersed across various sources such as source code, documentation, and runtime logs. To address this, automated tools for efficient AK extraction and documentation are essential. Even after generating AK, navigating through vast the Architectural Records can be overwhelming. Building on that, we propose an automated Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) System using Information Extraction and Generative AI, which generates AK from various source for a given system and answers architectural queries with respect to the given system. The development of an efficient Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) system, which is both effective and user-friendly, entails the resolution of numerous challenges. It requires consolidating diverse AK data sources scattered across code, dia-grams, repository commits, and online platforms. The integration of Multimodal AI for AK extraction, incorporation of global AK, and leveraging Generative AI for AK documentation further compounds the problem. Moreover, generating contextually appropriate query responses adds another layer of complexity. To this end, we performed an initial exploratory study on generating Architectural Design Decisions using generative Large Language Models (LLM) in the context of Architecture Decision Records (ADR). Our initial results have been promising indicating the potential impact of GenAI for architectural knowledge management.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Software development teams often deviate from their adopted frame-work, such as Scrum, and these deviations can sometimes bring consequences with different impact levels if the adaptations are not tailored for the specific teams’ needs and circumstances. For instance, agile developers sometimes oversimplify crucial Agile steps, such as estimating needed effort for a specific task or lack of explicit assessment of the criteria for “Definition of Done.” This information, though, is useful for subsequent planning activities. We hypothesise that generative AI could be used to help Agile teams conduct a number of software management tasks in a systematic and effective way. A family of experiments to compare the performance ofhumans andgenerative AItools,namely, GPT-models andBard,will be conducted. The findings from these experiments will serve as a foundation for a discussion on the role of artificial intelligence in software engineering tasks. This discussion will primarily focus on the balance between performance (perfect?) and efficiency (done?) and the importance of human oversight in Agile environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Temi, Mobile Robot is programmed to act as a receptionist and registration robot in hospitals to simplify the task of hospital staff and decrease the waiting time of patients and thereby serves the patients more effectively and efficiently. In this project, a programmed robot handled certain hospital staff duties, such as greeting patients and directing them to the preliminary investigation room if an appointment is already scheduled, after verifying this with specific patient data. The robot will prompt the patient to provide information such as name, ID number, and the section or doctor they would like to see if they do not already have an appointment. Thus, the robot will schedule a visit and provide the patient's turn number. The patient can type on the screen or speak in response to the robot. The robot is designed to go from patient to patient while they are seated in the waiting area, performing the preliminary examination in their stead and saving time. Moreover, the temi's face-tracking technology adapts the screen to the user's position. The Hospital use case is deployed and tested for 10 patients and the robot is reliable for 95 % of the trials. From the survey collected from the users it is observed that patients in the age group below 50% found it interesting and engaging while old people are not comfortable with the use of Robots in health care. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of resource optimization scheduling for large and complex engineering projects, this paper proposes an optimization scheduling algorithm system based on cloud computing, which deeply integrates cloud computing, convolutional neural network (CNN) and Beetle Antennae Search (BAS). The Cloud Convolution Antennae Search (CCAS) model is proposed to realize efficient, accurate and dynamic resource allocation and scheduling. With cloud computing as the underlying support, the CCAS model realizes efficient storage, processing and real-time update of large-scale engineering project data through the powerful computing power and elastic expansion characteristics of cloud computing, ensuring that the model can still maintain efficient operation in the face of massive and dynamic data, and providing a solid foundation for subsequent intelligent decision-making. Secondly, at the algorithmic level, CNN is applied to the prediction of resource demand of engineering projects. It uses its advantages in spatiotemporal series data modeling to carry out deep learning on multi-dimensional data such as project schedule and resource consumption to achieve accurate prediction of future resource demand. At the same time, a Longniu whisker search algorithm is introduced to make resource scheduling decision. BAS simulates the natural process of Longurus searching for food, explores the scheduling space effectively by iteratively updating the search path, and finds the global optimal or near-optimal scheduling scheme. The organic combination of the three not only provides strong computing power support and the advantages of data management and deep learning in complex data mining, but also utilizes the efficiency of optimization algorithms in large-scale problem solving. In terms of system architecture, the three-layer cloud service model based on IaaS, PaaS and SaaS is built to provide comprehensive support for the research and development, deployment, operation and application of resource scheduling algorithms. IaaS layer integrates hardware resources to realize on-demand infrastructure rental. PaaS layer provides big data processing, AI algorithm library and other development environment to help scheduling model construction and optimization; The SaaS layer encapsulates various scheduling functions and is easy for engineering project teams to call directly. Finally, this paper compares the model algorithm with the neural network and analyzes the case to verify the significant advantages of the proposed system in the accuracy of project resource demand prediction, the scientific scheduling decision and the overall efficiency improvement. The results show that the cloud computing based engineering project resource optimization scheduling algorithm system integrates the CCAS of the three, effectively solves the complexity and uncertainty problems that the traditional scheduling methods are difficult to deal with, realizes the intelligent and fine management of engineering projects, and provides a strong technical support for industry practice.  © 2024 IEEE.},

At the beginning of their studies, students usually only know the basics of IT, primarily related to their personal (mobile) environments, rather than real business scenarios such as business process management or workflow management. This paper explores an innovative teaching concept in the digitalization field for business students. It focuses on how students perceive process automation in workflows using tools like Camunda, especially when tasks involve artificial intelligence (AI) components and decision models (DMN). In this paper, we discuss the decision criteria relevant to the selection of an automation task for business students, examining the criteria students use to choose topics—whether based on difficulty, topic selection (such as supplier selection, project evaluation, product development, etc.), or the relevance to DMN and AI. Additionally, we compare whether there are differences in topic selection between Vietnamese and Swiss students. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Notably, African countries are leading in the shift towards renewable energy, inspiring smart city initiatives, particularly in Kigali. The study critically documents and reflects on real-world architectural and infrastructural transformations in Kigali, examining socio-technical elements facilitating these changes and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Our methodology utilises cloud-based simulation analysis, generative design optimisation, and building physics tools, incorporating Kigali’s cultural, geographical and climatic specifics. These strategies have led to various initiatives, such as sustainable smart buildings, smart traffic management, and digitally enabled economic environments. A Kigali Innovation City (KIC) case study exemplifies Kigali’s sustainable vision but also reveals challenges like neglect of demographic and economic realities. Learning from these hurdles, the team, including the author, is working on the large 42-ha Vision City Phase 2, aiming for carbon neutrality and the International Well-Being Institute certification.

For each module, EO data, calculation models and algorithms are integrated to identify “hot-spots” of urban and peri-urban territory at high risk from the point of view of land degradation caused by phenomena of hydrogeological instability, sediment flow or vegetation fires. The extracted information is expressed with specific indicators (“geo-analytics”) calculated dynamically and automatically.

A typical NEDO project has an implementation period of about 5 years, a total budget of about 3 billion yen, and about 7 participating companies. Project managers (PMs) formulate basic project plans, establish implementation systems, manage progress, and allocate budgets in NEDO projects. NEDO has developed two tools for enhancing PM's leadership capabilities: 1) 'R&D Management Guideline' to foster PM mindsets and 2) a 'Training Course' that teaches the basic knowledge and skills needed to serve as a PM. This 'Training Course' consists of 5 management skills classes and 5 planning skills classes. This study analyzes the PM 'Training Course' by applying quantitative and text analysis on questionnaire results in order to improve PM human resource development. Results show that management skills classes were more satisfactory and useful than planning skill classes. This result suggests that emphasizing the acquisition and advancement of management skills is an effective strategy for PMs human resource development.  © 2024 PICMET.},

However, in practice, participants execute their tasks using applications within their workspace and manually report their activities to a separate PMS. This approach is not only time-consuming for end-users but also poses reliability challenges for the PMS in verifying the accuracy of reported task completion. This paper proposes an AI-augmented framework to establish seamless integration between PMSs and end-user workspace, which can automatically manage process execution by intelligently monitoring the tasks of process participants. We examined the utilization of our framework via a prototype pMage in a software implementation process. The results showcase the capability in managing process progress in various scenarios. The service effortlessly integrates the working environment with the corresponding process while maintaining its low-code applicability and independence from specific PMS or end-user workspace. This framework is anticipated to encourage end-users to embrace PMS as an integral part of their daily work, thereby unlocking the benefits of a process-aware workspace. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Unlocking the potential of Big Data Analytics (BDA) has proven to be a transformative factor for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This has prompted researchers to focus attention on BDA in the AEC industry (BDA-in-AECI) in recent years, leading to a proliferation of relevant research. However, an in-depth exploration of the literature on BDA-in-AECI remains scarce. As a result, this study seeks to systematically explore the state-of-the-art review on BDA-in-AECI and identify research trends and gaps in knowledge to guide future research. Design/methodology/approach: This state-of-the-art review was conducted using a mixed-method systematic review. Relevant publications were retrieved from Scopus and then subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A quantitative bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer software and Gephi to reveal the status quo of research in the domain. A further qualitative analysis was performed on carefully screened articles. Based on this mixed-method systematic review, knowledge gaps were identified and future research agendas of BDA-in-AECI were proposed. Findings: The results show that BDA has been adopted to support AEC decision-making, safety and risk assessment, structural health monitoring, damage detection, waste management, project management and facilities management. BDA also plays a major role in achieving construction 4.0 and Industry 4.0. The study further revealed that data mining, cloud computing, predictive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, such as deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, are the key methods used for BDA-in-AECI. Moreover, several data acquisition platforms and technologies were identified, including building information modeling, Internet of Things (IoT), social networking and blockchain. Further studies are needed to examine the synergies between BDA and AI, BDA and Digital twin and BDA and blockchain in the AEC industry. Originality/value: The study contributes to the BDA-in-AECI body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive scope of understanding and revealing areas for future research directions beneficial to the stakeholders in the AEC industry. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The study introduces an innovative breakthrough in the analysis of medical images, particularly focusing on the timely identification and categorization of lung cancer using computed tomography (CT) scans. Employing the pioneering Cat Mouse Optimizer algorithm, which has undergone enhancements via self-improving mechanisms, we' ve crafted an intricate framework. This framework seamlessly integrates cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to streamline the process of diagnosing lung cancer from CT scans with unparalleled precision and efficiency. Conventional methods for diagnosing lung cancer often hinge on manual interpretation of CT images by radiologists, a process susceptible to time constraints and human error. Our methodology tackles these challenges by capitalizing on the capabilities of artificial intelligence and deep learning methodologies. Through extensive training on extensive datasets of annotated CT scans, our model becomes adept at identifying nuanced patterns and indicators of lung cancer, leading to robust classification outcomes. The hallmark attributes of our system encompass its flexibility and scalability, enabling continual enhancement and adaptation over time. The self-enhancing features of the Cat Mouse Optimizer algorithm empower the system to autonomously fine-tune its algorithms and parameters, informed by feedback from new data and user interactions. This guarantees that the system remains abreast of the latest advancements in medical imaging and lung cancer research. Moreover, our framework underscores the importance of interpretability and transparency, furnishing clinicians with invaluable insights into the decision-making process of the AI model. This cultivates trust and collaboration between human experts and AI systems, culminating in more precise diagnoses and enhanced patient outcomes. Through rigorous experimentation and validation across varied datasets, we showcase the effectiveness and dependability of our methodology in real-world clinical scenarios. Our system exhibits promising outcomes in terms of sensitivity and specificity, surpassing existing approaches to lung cancer classification. In essence, our project marks a significant stride forward in the domain of medical image analysis, presenting a potent tool for the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer. By amalgamating the strengths of advanced machine learning techniques and self-improving algorithms, we aspire to transform the landscape of lung cancer detection and management, ultimately contributing to saving lives and advancing healthcare outcomes. © 2024 IEEE.},

This information feeds into a pre-trained machine learning model, which generates recommendations for optimal traffic signal durations. These recommendations are then communicated to the traffic light controller, which dynamically adjusts signal timings based on current conditions. The adaptive traffic control system continuously monitors and adapts to changing traffic patterns, leading to reduced congestion and minimized delays.

	abstract = {Conceptual cost estimates, evaluated during a construction project's initiation phase, are fundamental for determining whether to invest in the project, validating its budget, or screening alternatives. Compared to traditional estimation techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) methods proved effective in assessing the nonlinear relationship between project variables and actual cost at completion. Due to the number and variability of available studies, it is not clear which AI techniques are most effective. This study systematically reviews previous works employing AI for conceptual cost estimation, focusing on the techniques adopted and the scorers utilised. The results show a rising trend in AI adoption, including supervised machine learning, knowledge-based, and evolutionary techniques. Performance-wise, the results hint at gradient boosting, random forest, and neural networks proving superior to both genetic algorithms and case-based reasoning techniques, which in turn prove superior to linear models. This review provides a brief overview of possible AI techniques and performance scorers to utilise for conceptual cost estimation in construction projects. © Association of Researchers in Construction Management},

With the growing prevalence of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions worldwide, timely and precise diagnosis is paramount for effective patient care. The study begins with a comprehensive review of existing methodologies and technologies employed in the identification of chest diseases from X-ray images. It critically evaluates the strengths and limitations of current approaches, highlighting the challenges faced in achieving high accuracy, speed, and scalability. To address these issues, the project aims to develop an AI-powered system for medical image analysis. In response to these challenges, our research proposes a novel approach that integrates Inception V3 model and imagenet. We leverage a large dataset of annotated chest X-rays to train a deep neural network capable of recognizing subtle patterns indicative of various diseases, including pneumonia, pneumothorax, lung and cardiac abnormalities. The model is optimized to provide not only accurate diagnoses but also to minimize false positives and negatives. In conclusion, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts in utilizing chest X-ray images for disease identification, presenting a robust and efficient methodology that could revolutionize the current diagnostic landscape.

	abstract = {This groundbreaking paper, driven by AI and ML, seeks to revolutionize heart disease management globally through data visualization and predictive modeling. Given the persistent prevalence of cardiac disease, proactive measures are imperative, with early diagnosis pivotal for effective intervention. Employing advanced AI and ML techniques, our primary goal is to glean invaluable insights from extensive heart health datasets, utilizing sophisticated data visualization tools to enhance comprehension. In contrast to the current landscape of the medical field, which is abundant in data but often lacks robust analytical tools capable of discerning intricate patterns and trends, this research embarks on a journey into the realm of state-of-the-art discovery techniques housed within databases. The primary emphasis is directed towards the prediction of heart diseases, utilizing datasets traditionally confined to the realms of medical studies. A multitude of trials have been conducted, rigorously evaluating the efficacy of various predictive data mining methodologies on identical datasets. The findings underscore the superiority of decision trees over alternative techniques. While Bayesian classification occasionally demonstrates comparable accuracy to decision trees, methodologies such as KNN, neural networks, and classification generally exhibit inferior performance metrics. A significant discovery reveals that employing genetic methods to refine real data enhances the accuracy of both decision trees and Bayesian classification, resulting in remarkable outcomes conducive to heart disease prediction. The utilization of Pyplot, an indispensable tool within the matplotlib module, is vital for generating a diverse array of plots and graphs, spanning charts, histograms, scatter plots, and 3D charts. Key functionalities such as standardscaler(), expression distribution, and confusion matrix bolster the model's resilience. As this project reaches its apex, a comprehensive plan emerges, showcasing the model's precision and offering a nuanced insight into its predictive prowess. This holistic approach not only empowers healthcare providers by enhancing diagnostic precision but also fosters a deeper understanding of individual health among patients. Through the fusion of AI, ML, and advanced visualization techniques, our aim is to redefine the management of cardiovascular health, thus making a significant contribution to global well-being.  © 2024 IEEE.},

But while there is a broad consensus on this, and public regulative initiatives are taken; there is far less knowledge about how these dilemmas/opportunities/risks are played out in practice. The interest into ethics in organisation driven by a discourse on “Trustworthy AI”; makes us wonder whether an ethical approach to AI in organisation is purposeful; or needs modification. We investigate this by viewing the development and use of AI as structuration of practices. The empirical material is our own development of an AI system. Using studies of ethics in moral engineering design; AI is a question of structuration processers with unintended consequences. It is a “slide” from ethics of virtue to ethics of benefit as corroborated by engineers/designers referring ethical dilemmas to managers and politicians. The EU framework of Trustworthy AI for designing and using more accountable AI systems - considering ethics; human autonomy; harm prevention; fairness etc., conflicts with contemporary construction organisations.

However, labels assigned to issues are often inconsistent, which can negatively impact the performance of supervised classification models. In this work, we investigate how label consistency and training data size affect automatic issue classification. We first evaluate a few-shot learning approach on a manually validated dataset and compare it to fine-tuning on a larger crowd-sourced set. The results show that our approach achieves higher accuracy when trained and tested on consistent labels. We then examine zero-shot classification using GPT-3.5, finding that its performance is comparable to supervised models despite having no fine-tuning. This suggests that generative models can help classify issues when annotated data is limited. Overall, our findings provide insights into balancing data quantity and quality for issue classification. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become popular in the industrial sector as it helps to improve operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. However, deploying and managing ML models in production environments can be complex. This is where Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) comes in. MLOps aims to facilitate this deployment and management process. One of the MLOps challenges is understanding how ML models reason, which is key to trust and acceptance. Here, explainable AI (XAI) can help. Better error identification and improved model accuracy are only two resulting advantages. An often neglected fact is that deployed models are bypassed when model performance or explanations do not meet user expectations. In this paper, we provide a novel reference architecture to address the challenge of integrating explanations and feedback capabilities into MLOps. Our architecture is implemented in a series of industrial use cases in the project EXPLAIN. The proposed MLOps software architecture has several advantages. It provides an efficient way to manage ML models in production environments. Further, it allows for integrating explanations into the development and deployment processes. © 2024 IEEE.},

When it comes to images, the challenge is increased, as they have characteristics that differentiate them from other typologies. We conducted a study in which we obtained a set of 27 images described according to their content, by researchers of the projects where they are inserted. After obtaining the ground-truth that would support the analysis, we proceeded to two more stages of description, one through an automatic processing tool (Vision AI) and the other through researchers with no knowledge of the images. We concluded that the human description is more elucidative of the images’ content, namely at a semantic level. In turn, the automatic tools enhance a more literal description. This study allowed us to reflect on the description of images in a research context and to discuss the potential of formal analysis and analysis of the semantic expression of images. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

In this project, an innovative approach that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to address these challenges comprehensively is being proposed. This AI-driven organ matching system employs advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze extensive donor and recipient datasets, swiftly identifying optimal matches based on medical histories, genetic profiles, and geographic proximity. By streamlining the matching process, this system significantly reduces wait times and enhances transplantation success rates. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology ensures the integrity and transparency of transplantation-related data by securely recording all transactions and medical records on a decentralized ledger. This approach not only safeguards sensitive medical information but also fosters trust among patients, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies. Through this synergistic fusion of AI and blockchain, our framework offers a scalable and sustainable solution to revolutionize transplantation management, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced confidence in the healthcare system. © 2024 IEEE.},

By exploring how AI supports monitoring peatlands and climate change, we propose a novel framework that integrates AI and peatland management in order to bolster climate resilience and sustainability efforts based on evidence. Therefore, policymakers can improve the peatland restoration, monitoring and conservation programs by leveraging AI for data analysis, predictive modelling and decision-making processes. AI enables real-time tracking of peatland conditions, detecting activities and wildfires, and optimizing land management strategies.

It is based on personal experience while working on several research and innovation projects in diverse areas - business process management, unauthorized intrusion detection, malicious interference protection, digital forensics and diagnostics, data management, etc. Despite their differences, all these areas share something in common: they require multiple operations to be executed in a single transaction and incorporate heuristic rules for different purposes, related to data, knowledge, and operation management. The position of this article is that combining the classical rule-based approach from the early days of AI with more recent developments in AI, such as data-focused machine learning and utility-based reinforcement learning, as well as utilization of the recent technological developments on the cloud and at data centers can be beneficial for widening the real-world application of AI. The challenges, which this complexity creates require joined efforts of academic researchers, industrial engineers, and business enablers.

Boot space of a car, remains underutilized due to the lack of automation and intelligent planning. Firstly, the inability to fulfil the optimal utilization of available space leads to inefficient packing, often resulting in wasted room and compromised comfort during travel. Secondly, the absence of a smart planner of luggage causes the problem, especially when coordinating luggage from multiple passengers or pick-up points. This lack of coordination not only impedes efficient space allocation but also prolongs the loading process, causing delays and inconvenience. The technical implementation of the project involves hardware, software, and machine learning principles. Hardware components such as raspberry pi, force sensors, and camera module will form the backbone of the system. On the software side, a cloud-based Android Auto application will facilitate communication between the vehicle and a centralized server, where the machine learning model resides. This model will continuously analyze incoming data, learning from past experiences to generate optimized packing plans. Finally, user interfaces on the vehicle's infotainment system through the Android auto application provides smart access to the system, allowing passengers to input their luggage details and receive real-time packing recommendations. © 2024 IEEE.},

Through the integration of AI-based techniques, the study aims to propose an approach based on graph-structured data to manage the complexity of geospatial information and improve planners' ability to abstract the possible relationships between elements of the territory. The approach utilizes graph-based data modeling while preserving spatial connections. It has been demonstrated how, through a bipartite graph approach, it is possible to decode the territorial components while taking into account the spatial connections between different pieces of information. Furthermore, the implementation of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has been discussed as a way to facilitate a more integrated and context-aware analysis.

	abstract = {In the rapidly urbanizing landscape of Mumbai, a megacity confronted with significant traffic management and law enforcement challenges, the deployment of an advanced city surveillance system represents a transformative approach to urban governance. This paper examines the integration of over 11,000 CCTV cameras into the Mumbai Traffic Police's operational framework, covering an area of 438 square kilometers encompassing 41 traffic divisions and 94 police stations. Since its inception in 2016, the system has been pivotal in enhancing safety, order, and mobility within the city, especially amid obstacles such as ongoing infrastructure projects, traffic congestion, accidents, and natural disasters. Central to this study is the analysis of the Mumbai City Surveillance System Project (MCSP), which leverages CCTV technology to generate and classify Incident Reports (IR) based on severity, ranging from minor disruptions to significant emergencies. The period from October 2021 to 2023 saw a marked increase in IR generation, from 742 reports in 2021 to 10,392 in 2022 and 9,639 in 2023, indicating the system's growing efficacy in real-time traffic management and incident response.This paper further explores the cutting-edge integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within the MCSP framework, highlighting the role of computational intelligence in enhancing the capabilities of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). By employing AI-driven predictive analytics, the system effectively anticipates traffic conditions based on diverse variables such as traffic flow, vehicle speed, and weather, thereby optimizing traffic management strategies.The findings underscore the significant impact of AI and IoT technologies in redefining urban transportation networks, demonstrating improved efficiency, safety, and resilience in the face of Mumbai's complex transportation challenges. This study contributes to the discourse on smart city initiatives, offering insights into the role of advanced computational technologies in facilitating intelligent transportation solutions and shaping the future of urban living.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The results suggest that these technologies in the medical field can reduce workload, standardize diagnosis, improve accuracy and treatment, and positively impact the quality of patient care. The management of chronic wounds is complex due to their etiology and the lack of visual capacity of the medical professional. For this reason, the automation of these processes promises to have the potential to significantly improve medical care, and consequently, affect the quality of patients' lives. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Extended Reality (XR) technologies in construction education, focusing on their application in internship programs. Traditional internships often face limitations such as restricted exposure to complex scenarios and geographical constraints. To address these challenges, this research examines how BIM-XR technologies can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) disciplines. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative data from interviews with students, educators, and industry professionals alongside quantitative survey data. This comprehensive methodology enabled an in-depth assessment of BIM-XR's impact on student learning outcomes and operational efficiency. The findings revealed that BIM-XR integration significantly enhances educational experiences by providing immersive simulations that help students visualize complex construction processes. This leads to better preparedness for real-world challenges, increased engagement, and more effective internships. Additionally, BIM-XR offers practical benefits for industry practices, such as improved project planning, real-time decision-making, and enhanced stakeholder collaboration. However, the study also highlights challenges, including the steep learning curve, limited access to necessary technologies, and high implementation costs. These limitations point to the need for comprehensive training programs, affordable technology options, and institutional support to ensure broader adoption. Looking ahead, the study suggests that further integration of BIM-XR with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT) could further enhance educational outcomes and industry practices. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Optimizing field operations to boost sustainability while maintaining output levels is one of these projects. The fourth industrial revolution is having a significant influence on the oil and gas industry, which also makes it feasible to more thoroughly examine possibilities for lowering carbon footprints. With the aid of contemporary production logging technology, the formation may be accurately described, and its production behavior quantified. Technologies that use polymer injection may significantly lower water cut, which helps lower carbon emissions and achieve net-zero objectives. We evaluated the effects of various polymer injection strategies on the Volve field using a variety of production and injection wells in order to predict the influence of injecting polymers on the fluid production rates. Lowering the reservoir’s water production rates is made possible by the injection of polymers. Consequently, managing produced water and water injection results in a reduced carbon footprint. Integrating properly log interpreted polymer amounts to maximize recovery is a crucial component of optimization. The total carbon footprint was determined using a probability-likelihood framework following the evaluation of many scenarios to determine their overall impact on carbon emissions. Although there are many factors that determine the optimal injection strategy, polymers have demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce overall carbon footprints while increasing hydrocarbon output. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

These technologies use sensor and IoT data to provide individualized, responsive, and effective assistance for elderly people. Many obstacles prevent these systems from reaching their full potential. Training data quality and representativeness are major issues. Collecting broad and reliable datasets that represent older people's real-world experiences is vital yet challenging. The ethical and technological challenges of protecting senior users' sensitive data are very high. To offer accurate and contextually relevant replies, multimodal data from aural, visual, and tactile sources must be seamlessly integrated. Maintaining robots' physical and cognitive ergonomics for natural and intuitive interactions is another design challenge. This study offers an AI-driven HRI system to improve senior care to solve these issues. Creating powerful AI models that can learn from high-quality, diversified datasets and combining multimodal data processing approaches to increase robotic caregiver accuracy and responsiveness are the goals. To employ the robots safely and ethically in geriatric care, the project will improve their physical design and apply strong data privacy and security safeguards.

	abstract = {Optimizing the management of construction processes is crucial in municipal engineering, yet it struggles with incorrect performance positioning. Traditional Neural network algorithms fail to adequately address this issue, resulting in subpar outcomes. Consequently, an optimized approach based on Computational intelligence for managing municipal engineering construction processes is introduced, and its efficacy is evaluated. Firstly, employing artificial intelligence theory helps identify influential factors, and these indicators are categorized according to the needs of process management optimization to minimize disruptive elements. Following this, a scheme for Computational intelligence-based construction process management optimization is devised using artificial intelligence theories, and its results are meticulously examined. MATLAB simulations indicate that, under specific evaluation criteria, Computational intelligence surpasses conventional Neural network algorithms in both precision and speed of impact variables in construction process management optimizationThis indicates that Computational intelligence can significantly enhance construction process management optimization in municipal engineering, leading to more efficient and effective project outcomes. The use of AI theory not only identifies the crucial factors influencing the construction process but also minimizes potential disruptions, ensuring a smoother execution of projects. This research paves the way for future exploration into integrating advanced algorithms with construction management practices. © 2024 IEEE.},

They often pursue highly heterogeneous approaches, leading to new challenges in collaboration, particularly regarding software quality, data versioning and the traceability of model metrics and other resulting artifacts. These challenges are further intensified when AI projects rely on dynamic datasets, introducing an entirely new dimension that teams must deal with. Adopting principles from the machine learning operations (MLOps) paradigm becomes essential in this context. To go beyond existing process models and develop actionable guidelines, our work introduces a Git workflow for AI projects. We present basic instructions for data and code while outlining a minimal infrastructure setup. Building upon abstract concepts, we delve into concrete, actionable steps by examining the proposed branching workflow. Through a case study, we apply the development methodology to two use cases and demonstrate that the principles and approaches positively impact project outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

These collaborations aim to create new products that meet market needs, deliver value to customers and end-users, and generate revenue for firms. However, the rate of NPD failure is high with traditional NPD often facing significant challenges that can limit productivity and product innovation performance; these include lengthy development cycles and limited market insights. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential collaborator for NPD teams. Much like the emergence of rapid prototyping in the 1980s, which is now widely accepted as a standard NPD tool in most engineering firms, AI promises to revolutionize NPD by improving decision-making, reducing development time, and providing deeper market insights. This paper examines the current state of AI in NPD, reviewing its application across various industries and at different stages of the NPD lifecycle. In addition, the paper outlines some of the key implications of AI adoption for technology and engineering managers, emphasizing the need for AI infrastructure investment, regulatory compliance, strategic planning and cultural change, cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and employee development. © 1973-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The security of data and apps stored on the cloud must be guaranteed due to the growing reliance on cloud computing. The goal of this project is to create an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is only intended to be used in cloud environments, using Artificial Intelligence (AI). A machine learning model trained on the NSL-KDD dataset enhances the algorithm's capacity to distinguish between likely intrusions and legitimate network traffic. This research provides a novel approach that combines a hybrid backpropagation neural network with a genetic algorithm for cloud-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). The hybrid model will be more accurate and resilient in recognizing various types of intrusions by merging the best aspects of both methods. The backpropagation neural network serves as the foundation for understanding complex patterns in the dataset, while the evolutionary algorithm improves the model parameters for improved performance. The proposed methodology has potential, with an impressive 97.65% accuracy rate. This high degree of accuracy demonstrates how well cloud environments can detect and address any security threats using the hybrid neural network and genetic algorithm method. The study's conclusions address the expanding problems caused by cyber attacks on cloud computing and advance the creation of AI -powered security measures. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many data science endeavors encounter failure, surfacing at any project phase. Even after successful deployments, data science projects grapple with ethical dilemmas, such as bias and discrimination. Current project management methodologies prioritize efficiency and cost savings over risk management. The methodologies largely overlook the diverse risks of sociotechnical systems and risk articulation inherent in data science lifecycles. Conversely, while the established risk management framework (RMF) by NIST and McKinsey aims to manage AI risks, there is a heavy reliance on normative definitions of risk, neglecting the multifaceted subjectivities of data science project failures. This paper reports on a systematic literature review that identifies three main themes: Big Data Execution Issues, Demand for a Risk Management Framework tailored for Large-Scale Data Science Projects, and the need for a General Risk Management Framework for all Data Science Endeavors. Another overarching focus is on how risk is articulated by the institution and the practitioners. The paper discusses a novel and adaptive data science risk management framework – “DS EthiCo RMF” – which merges project management, ethics, and risk management for diverse data science projects into one holistic framework. This agile risk management framework DS EthiCo RMF can bridge the current divide between normative risk standards and the multitude of data science requirements, offering a human-centric method to navigate the intertwined sociotechnical risks of failure in data science projects. © 2024, IJISPM.},

To enhance BM performance, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for beam prediction in the evolution toward sixth-generation (6G) communications. The main goals of these 3GPP-based standard studies are to minimize the overhead from reference signals (RSs) and to reduce the number of beam sweepings at the user equipment (UE), which arise due to frequent beam measurements caused by UE movement and rotation. This paper delves into an AI/ML algorithm design that supports spatial domain beam prediction tailored for BM in 6G. This includes forecasting the optimal beam (pairs) and anticipating beam changes. Simulations are based on a data-driven strategy that uses RS receive power (RSRP) measurements as input for fast beam pair prediction with an advanced convolutions neural network (CNN) architecture. Results indicate that the proposed AI/ML model outperforms conventional BM techniques, reducing beam sweeping overhead and thereby validating the AI/ML's potential in BM. Additionally, our proposed algorithm achieves up to 40.58% higher beam prediction accuracy and improves the mean RSRP difference of the predicted best beam pair by up to 2.89 d B. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose The rise of modern artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, machine learning (ML), has provided new opportunities and directions for knowledge management (KM). A central question for the future of KM is whether it will be dominated by an automation strategy that replaces knowledge work or whether it will support a knowledge-enablement strategy that enhances knowledge work and uplifts knowledge workers. This paper addresses this question by re-examining and updating a critical argument against KM by the sociologist of science Steve Fuller (2002), who held that KM was extractive and exploitative from its origins. Background This paper re-examines Fuller’s argument in light of current developments in artificial intelligence and knowledge management technologies. It reviews Fuller’s arguments in its original context wherein expert systems and knowledge engineering were influential paradigms in KM, and it then considers how the arguments put forward are given new life in light of current developments in AI and efforts to incorporate AI in the KM technical stack. The paper shows that conceptions of tacit knowledge play a key role in answering the question of whether an automating or enabling strategy will dominate. It shows that a better understanding of tacit knowledge, as reflected in more recent literature, supports an enabling vision. Methodology The paper uses a conceptual analysis methodology grounded in epistemology and knowledge studies. It reviews a set of historically important works in the field of knowledge management and identifies and analyzes their core concepts and conceptual structure. Contribution The paper shows that KM has had a faulty conception of tacit knowledge from its origins and that this conception lends credibility to an extractive vision supportive of replacement automation strategies. The paper then shows that recent scholarship on tacit knowledge and related forms of reasoning, in particular, abduction, provide a more theoretically robust conception of tacit knowledge that supports the centrality of human knowledge and knowledge workers against replacement automation strategies. The paper provides new insights into tacit knowledge and human reasoning vis-à-vis knowledge work. It lays the foundation for KM as a field with an independent, ethically defensible approach to technology-based business strategies that can leverage AI without becoming a merely supporting field for AI. Findings Fuller’s argument is forceful when updated with examples from current AI technologies such as deep learning (DL) (e.g., image recognition algorithms) and large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Fuller’s view that KM presupposed a specific epistemology in which knowledge can be extracted into embodied (computerized) but disembedded (decontextualized) information applies to current forms of AI, such as machine learning, as much as it does to expert systems. Fuller’s concept of expertise is narrower than necessary for the context of KM but can be expanded to other forms of knowledge work. His account of the social dynamics of expertise as professionalism can be expanded as well and fits more plausibly in corporate contexts. The concept of tacit knowledge that has dominated the KM literature from its origins is overly simplistic and outdated. As such, it supports an extractive view of KM. More recent scholarship on tacit knowledge shows it is a complex and variegated concept. In particular, current work on tacit knowledge is developing a more theoretically robust and detailed conception of human knowledge that shows its centrality in organizations as a driver of innovation and higher-order thinking. These new understandings of tacit knowledge support a non-extractive, human enabling view of KM in relation to AI. Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners can use the findings of the paper to consider ways to implement KM technologies in ways that do not neglect the importance of tacit knowledge in automation projects (which neglect often leads to failure). They should also consider how to enhance and fully leverage tacit knowledge through AI technologies and augment human knowledge. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers can use these findings as a conceptual framework in research concerning the impact of AI on knowledge work. In particular, the distinction between replacement and enabling technologies, and the analysis of tacit knowledge as a structural concept, can be used to categorize and analyze AI technologies relative to KM research objectives. Impact on Society The potential of AI on employment in the knowledge economy is a major issue in the ethics of AI literature and is widely recognized in the popular press as one of the pressing societal risks created by AI and specific types such as generative AI. This paper shows that KM, as a field of research and practice, does not need to and should not add to the risks created by automation-replacement strategies. Rather, KM has the conceptual resources to pursue a (human) knowledge enablement approach that can stand as a viable alternative to the automation-replacement vision. Future Research The findings of the paper suggest a number of research trajectories. They include: Further study of tacit knowledge and its underlying cognitive mechanisms and structures in relation to knowledge work and KM objectives. Research into different types of knowledge work and knowledge processes and the role that tacit and explicit knowledge play. Research into the relation between KM and automation in terms of KM’s history and current technical developments. Research into how AI arguments knowledge works and how KM can provide an enabling framework. © 2024 Informing Science Institute. All rights reserved.},

Drones, U-space, UTM, and their application to Air Mobility are fostering new applications that evolve quicker than the regulatory framework. For instance, the number of domains of applications is increasing, ranging from infrastructure inspection to parcel deliveries in urban settings. Thus, the number of drones flying simultaneously in the same geographical area is expected to grow over the next few years. It will soon pose safety issues as it might become more and more challenging to ensure safe control of drones so that they are separated from each other and with manned flight operations. The deconfliction or separation management problem, a pressing issue, has been tackled in several research projects. However, there is still an urgent need for a better approach to automate deconfliction at the strategic and tactical levels. Our SESAR-funded project (AI4HyDrop) aims to explore the use of machine learning to develop an intelligent control system to resolve drone deconfliction. To this purpose, we have conducted an extensive literature review, as outlined in this paper. This research was needed to understand better how AI has been explored in the field of UAV's deconfliction and thus will pave the way for basic concepts that contribute to the requirement elicitation for an AI model-based UAV's deconfliction. © 2024 IEEE.},

Beyond data and model requirements, AI/ML projects necessitate cross-domain performance, business analysis, effective stakeholder and team management, risk and quality management, and a tailored development approach. These factors underline the need for a systemic project management (PM) approach that addresses the interconnections among business, organizational, team, and PM factors, rather than focusing on isolated AI/ML achievements. Current PM methods like CRISP-DM, TDSP, Scrum, and Kanban may not adequately meet these challenges. Therefore, a systemic PM framework is essential for AI/ML project success, particularly in critical areas such as healthcare. This study argues for a change toward a principle-based, holistic, and systemic PM approach tailored to the performance domains of AI/ML projects. It explores the adoption of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK V7) for an ML project at Baskent University Hospital Ankara (BUHA). By combining Systems Engineering and Soft Systems Methodology with a survey on performance domains, we enhance PMBOK V7's applicability to AI/ML, proposing solutions that include conceptual and process models. Findings indicate PMBOK V7 meets AI/ML project requirements but needs adaptations for ML processes.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research paper delves into the symbiotic relationship between Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, and their pivotal role in revolutionizing crop management within the sphere of smart urban farming. Urban agriculture is rapidly emerging as a crucial solution to the challenges of food security and sustainability in densely populated areas. By harnessing the capabilities of IoT and AI this paper outlines a comprehensive framework for real-time monitoring and intelligent decision-making processes that are vital for the optimal growth of crops in urban settings. The core of this research lies in the seamless integration of IoT devices, such as sensors and automated systems, with advanced AI algorithms. This combination enables the continuous monitoring of various environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, leading to more informed and data-driven agricultural practices. The AI component of this integration is particularly significant in analyzing vast amounts of data collected by IoT devices, predicting potential issues, and making proactive decisions to enhance crop health and yield. The paper discusses in detail the methodology adopted for implementing this IoT-ai integration in urban farming scenarios. It includes the design and deployment of IoT networks, the development of AI models tailored to agriculture, and the establishment of a communication framework for effective data exchange. The results of experimental studies conducted to validate the efficiency of this integrated system are presented, showcasing significant improvements in crop yield, resource utilization, and overall farming efficiency. The paper also explores the broader implications of this technology. It discusses how the IoT-AI integration could be a game-changer in urban agriculture, potentially leading to more sustainable and self-sufficient urban communities. This study concludes with a forward-looking perspective, examining future prospects and potential enhancements of this technology, including the integration of advanced machine learning techniques and the scalability of the system for larger urban farming projects. This research not only demonstrates the immediate benefits of integrating IoT and AI in urban agriculture but also opens new avenues for future innovations in smart farming practices. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges for banks, NPAs have an adverse impact on profitability, stability, and shareholders' equity. The current study, therefore, is an attempt to explore the impact of NPAs on shareholders' equity and returns, with special emphasis on the application of AI and block chain technologies as innovative solutions to the problem. It considers takaful principles in examining Fintech Corporations characterized by high NPAs and focuses on the main external and internal factors behind NPAs high interest rates, inadequate monitoring, natural calamities, willful defaults, recession, and unhealthy competition. The study uses AI-based predictive analytics to project potential NPAs and proactive measures in enhancing asset management processes. Block chain helps to introduce transparency and security of financial transactions, providing an immutable ledger that will help in creating accurate record-keeping and auditability. Taken together, these technologies offer robust solutions for the management of NPAs, risk reduction, and financial stability. Results underline the huge impact AI and block chain can have in attenuating the negative impact of NPAs on shareholder equity and returns. These technologies, therefore, stabilize and make the banking sector more effective by addressing these interrelated external and internal factors. This research thus follows the journal's focus on the implementation and management of advanced information systems to improve socio-economic environments related to the potentials AI and block chain can bring into the process of financial management. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Therefore, the system is composed of a lot of different sensors that are incorporated into different physical devices. With this in mind, we explore the concept of management of an IoT network of these heterogeneous devices and evaluate the path to follow, considering the components that already exist in the system. We use the Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) as a management protocol, even though it is recent and there was not a lot of information on its use in cyber-physical systems. To integrate this protocol into this innovative platform, we present two approaches. The first one is based on the Eclipse's Leshan project and the second works with FIWARE's LwM2M IoT Agent. Concerns about the energy consumption by the Raspberry Pi and the smartphone application with the protocol were raised, so performance tests were made, and the results were favorable. The percentage of traffic introduced by LwM2M was also obtained.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The management of various tasks on the construction site mostly relies on the experience of managers, but this experiential management is often not the optimal solution. The implementation of a people-centered on-site management method plays a crucial role in providing managers with the optimal solution. In this paper, we presented a human-centric construction resource provisioning approach (CRA-AO) that combines computational intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation in construction projects while providing evaluation feedback. The proposed approach consists of two main parts. First, the concept of time series window is employed to incorporate various construction activities and human resources in the construction network diagram (i.e., an AOV network), leading to the optimal human resource allocation plan using an improved Aquila optimizer. Second, an AI-based method is proposed to train construction quality standards and actual quality parameters through a deep auto-coder, comparing the similarity analysis of the training results. We use actual project time and cost data for analysis and compare it with the cost related index of traditional construction schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CRA-AO approach effectively optimizes construction resource allocation and quality evaluation, enabling a robust project schedule and cost adjustments, while achieving optimized management of construction sites in projects. This research highlights the importance of human-centric computing and information science in developing intelligent, adaptive solutions for construction engineering challenges. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the challenges decision makers involved in a crisis face in obtaining a reliable picture of the situation. Collecting data rapidly and efficiently, incorporating diverse sources of information, and merging information into a near-real-time situational picture are crucial for managing critical situations effectively. The primary objective of the KRISAN research project is to develop the model for an AI-based assistance system that can automatically manage calls to hotlines and control centres and create a near-real-time situational picture during a crisis. This system aims to significantly enhance crisis management capabilities by providing decision makers with timely and accurate information. After the transfer into a product, the AI-based voice dialogue system will process hundreds of simultaneous calls. Two selected use cases, in which the phone calls are simulated, will be used to analyze and evaluate these calls in real-time using automated call centre support. Consequently, the system will dynamically generate relevant questions based on the course of the call to extract relevant information from the caller. By streamlining the call-handling process and leveraging AI technology, the KRISAN project aims to improve crisis response effectiveness, resource management, and contribute to better outcomes during health emergencies. © IDIMT 2024.All rights reserved.},

Unless both parties understand these implications, GenAI tools have the potential to disrupt the traditional balance of power and trust between Researcher and Supervisor, potentially impacting both the rigour of PhD training and research outcomes. Rather than exploring the technical competence and reach of GenAI tools, this scoping study explores Researcher/Supervisor relationships pre-and post-GenAI and sets out avenues for further research. Informed by structuration theory, and using reflective ethnography and semi-structured interviews, the research maps changes in agency and structure and identifies several important issues. Findings highlight that fear and suspicion surrounding the use of GenAI confer undue agency on the technology, which further conceals its use. Opportunities to develop critical analytical skills are missed and this can threaten the integrity of research outputs. The study concludes that GenAI tools should be more than a covert “third wheel” in the relationship. Instead, the technology could be openly incorporated into supervision frameworks in a transparent, integrated approach. © Association of Researchers in Construction Management},

As traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project, involves the marsh deer in the Paraná Delta, while the second, WiMoBo, focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuyú National Park. A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations.

	abstract = {The research aims to provide an artificial intelligence framework to improve strategic decision-making in higher education administration. Although offering unprecedented potential to tackle complex administrative challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence in managing higher education institutions is still in its early stages. This study aims to fill the existing gap by creating a comprehensive framework utilizing artificial intelligence to improve data-driven decision-making, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and strategic planning at universities. This study aims to identify the specific areas within higher education administration that are most inclined to utilize artificial intelligence for decision-making. The framework combines artificial intelligence technology with administrative data to optimize resource allocation, forecast trends, and offer actionable insights. A comprehensive literature analysis was conducted as part of the mixed-methods approach to methodology to find possible uses of artificial intelligence in school administration. The next phases involve building an artificial intelligence-based framework in an iterative way and then testing its functionality in a real institution’s setting. The goal of this project is to create a decision support system with artificial intelligence that can adjust to the unique needs of higher education administrators. The operation should be efficient and adaptable. The method claims to enhance the speed and precision of strategic decision-making, resulting in a notable enhancement of institutional performance and governance. This study’s results enhance the theoretical underpinnings of artificial intelligence in school administration and offer practical guidance for its application.

	abstract = {Nowadays, the global challenge of ensuring food security for a growing population necessitates innovative solutions in agriculture. The convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies presents a promising avenue for addressing key issues such as crop disease management and resource optimization. In that project proposes a holistic approach to smart agriculture by integrating IoT-based sensor systems for real-time monitoring of key agricultural parameters with AI-powered disease detection and severity estimation techniques. Leveraging advanced sensor technologies, including soil moisture, float level, pH, and humidity sensors, the proposed system collects real-time data from agricultural lands and transmits it to a cloud-based platform. Additionally, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is employed to detect and classify crop diseases from images captured in the field. The system further estimates disease severity by analyzing affected and unaffected leaf regions, enabling targeted treatment with appropriate pesticide concentrations. By combining IoT sensor data with AI-driven disease management. The integrated system offers a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture. Through early disease detection, optimized resource usage, and timely intervention, the proposed system aims to enhance crop yield, minimize wastage, and contribute towards global food security goals. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations projects that the global population will surpass 9 billion by 2050. With shrinking farmland, depleting natural resources, unpredictable climate shifts, and evolving market demands, the agricultural production system faces a transformative phase. To meet these challenges, agriculture must boost productivity, enhance efficiency, adapt to climate variability, and prioritize sustainability. However, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to tackle these demands head-on. The current study aims at presenting the contemporary Czech young generation and its interest and attitude towards food security, development of Czech agriculture and the impact of agriculture on the environment. The study uses a structured questionnaire and analyzes the primary data to verify the hypothesis. The study finds out that current younger generation in the Czech Republic displays minimal interest in topics such as food security, contemporary trajectory of Czech agriculture, and environmental effects of agricultural practices, and thereby the hypothesis is confirmed. The practical value of the study lies in the empirical assessment of the awareness about the Food Security in the Czech Republic and in the world and the awareness of food self-sufficiency in the Czech Republic, which proves the need for increased awareness. On the other hand, the recognition of hunger as a pivotal issue within the UN's Sustainability Goals is widespread. It reflects a collective understanding of the urgency to address food insecurity as a fundamental aspect of sustainable development. © IDIMT 2024.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Organizations depend on the capabilities their members possess to survive and succeed in the highly competitive operating environment. Typically, capability or competence profiles have been created cross-sectionally, serving the current needs of the organization, whilst the Knowledge (KM) and Human Resource Management (HRM) also need to be future-oriented, addressing the emerging needs for new capabilities in an anticipatory manner. The development of capability profiles has moved from I-shaped models stressing the need for deep professional special knowledge to T-shaped models where the emphasis is adding horizontal knowledge capabilities (about business processes and additional knowledge areas) to balance the deep vertical specialization to specific occupational areas. In an ECKM (European Conference on Knowledge Management) conference paper in 2022, a new model called T2-model was introduced on a conceptual level (Saukkonen & Kreus, 2022). The development step to earlier T-shaped capability models was the addition of a second horizontal layer on top of combinatory capabilities – thus the name of T2. The lower horizontal layer contains business-specific items (like supply chain management, quality, or project management) where advanced knowledge is needed. The higher horizontal layer contains items of phenomena where a basic level of knowledge is needed (e.g., financial literacy, AI principles, sustainability). In the experimental research design, capability profiles were created for selected professional positions. The capability profiles were created by both business professionals (individuals currently having or managing the profession in question) and higher education professionals (who educate undergraduates and graduates to the industry and function studied). The respondents filled into the visualized T2-model the skills preselected from earlier literature to relevant and were also able to add the skills they felt were missing in the original list of skills for the profession in question. The results give early proof-of-concept of the viability of T2-model as a method of bridging both HRM and KM within organizations as well as University-Industry views on the knowledge items and levels needed for the future. Furthermore, the results give a basis for the knowledge anticipation process. The paper elaborates on a new model for anticipation of knowledge and offers a process that organizations can use in designing their HRM and Knowledge Management. Using T2-model may offer an improved integration to other areas of planning such as technology development and strategic change. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The high accident rate in the construction industry has a major impact on how well projects turn out. Despite substantial investments in safety planning and supervision, there has been a marked increase in the construction industry’s accident rate compared to other sectors. Serious games based on VR have recently been used in the study, suggesting that workers are now more safety conscious. However, these situations need many resources to create and are not always realistic. Hence this paper, Digital Twin-based Construction Safety Training Framework (DT-CSTF) with Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been proposed to monitor employees’ emotional, mental, and physical well-being in real-time. The report sheds light on the significance of DT technology and its function in Industry 5.0. Using the Unity game engine, the proposed DT-CSTF creates a virtual reality-based training environment (VRTE) prototype that incorporates BIM, construction timetables, and safety requirements. Following this, the suggested structure enables gathering user data about risks and providing tailored feedback. Automated virtual reality game training scenarios are created using data given by digital twins on project intent, project status, safety requirements, and history. Both improved digital twins and periodic construction safety monitoring are anticipated to reap the benefits of dynamic virtual reality training. The proposed management system offers effectiveness of VR-based security training, cost-benefit analysis, monitoring,employee behaviour, safety education values are obtained by the ratio of 96,90 %, 98,33 %, 99,25 %, 95,91 %, 98,66 % respectively. © 2024; Los autores.},

	abstract = {The service management and orchestration (SMO) framework plays a major role in the management and orchestration (M&O) of applications, services, and components within the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture, as defined by the O-RAN Alliance. It comprises the non-real-time RAN intelligence controller (Non-RT RIC) and possesses the capability to incorporate management systems and components from multiple standards development organizations (SDOs), notably the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This multi-SDO-based SMO framework aims to provide a rich set of M&O services in a coherent and unified manner. Leveraging management data analytics (MDA) to deliver M&O services can enhance SMO capabilities. This article proposes an intelligence-driven approach by integrating MDA into the 3GPP and ETSI management systems within the context of SMO. Furthermore, it introduces the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) Function into the Non-RT RIC, consolidating existing intelligent components and introducing novel ones to enhance the intelligence capabilities of the Non-RT RIC. The article further proposes an architectural solution that unifies and facilitates interoperability among the intelligent systems of the 3GPP, ETSI, and Non-RT RIC - collectively referred to as 'three modules' - within SMO. It also presents the end-to-end lifecycle workflow of the AI/ML model across the three modules. Finally, the article outlines key research challenges related to integrating MDA within the SMO framework.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The project aims to develop an affective and intelligent tutoring system for detecting students facing difficulties and helping them. We designed this experimentation during the 2022–2023 academic year with students in a French engineering school. We collected and analyzed two primary data sources: student results from the Learning Management System (LMS) and images captured by students’ webcams during their learning activities. It is known that basic (primary) emotions (like fear or disgust) do not reflect student affective states when facing pedagogical issues (like misunderstanding or proudness). Since such “academic emotions” are not easy to define and detect, we changed the paradigm and used a 2D dimensional model that describes better the wide spectrum of emotion encountered. Moreover, it allows to build a temporal emotion trajectory reflecting the student’s emotional trajectory. Firstly, we observed a correlation between these trajectories and academic results. Secondly, we found that high-performing student trajectories are significantly different from the others. These preliminary results, support the idea that emotions are pivotal in distinguishing highly performing students from their less successful counterparts. This is the first step to assess students’ profiles and proactively identify those at risk of failure in a human learning context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Managing paper applications also poses challenges like misplacement and physical storage needs. Our methodology addresses this by designing the application’s UI in Figma, exporting assets to Android Studio and creating a new project. In Android Studio, we implement the UI and functionality using these design assets, integrating Firebase services for authentication, real-time database and storage. Artificial Intelligence will be used for formatting the applications. We then test the application and ensure ongoing maintenance and updates. Our observations reveal that many institutions still rely on traditional application methods.

In addition, weather variability can significantly impact the number of tourists visiting a destination. Thus, when analyzing tourist flows, it is essential to take account of weather variations. In this paper, a thorough analysis of the dynamics of monthly tourist flows per day and year is investigated, by using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically BIRCH. This approach allows the discerning of distinctive patterns and clusters within the tourist data. Furthermore, LightGBM is used with the above tourist data, to project the expected tourist flow based on date-time and weather fluctuations.

	abstract = {The convergence of cloud and edge computing, along with distributed AI and the latest 5G/6G communications, is revolutionizing collaboration, connectivity, and interaction. These digital advancements pave the way for a new era of AI-powered robots, enabling them to navigate unfamiliar scenarios and adapt in the long term by seamlessly engaging with the digital realm. Consequently, these innovative applications generate diverse, continuous, and rapidly evolving data transmission requirements that traditional network resource management struggles to satisfy in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we take a step beyond focusing solely on network-side traffic engineering efforts. Instead, we explore the potential of application-side traffic shaping within non-public networks to address these demanding transmission needs. Within the framework of optimizing Quality of Experience, we discuss on how the 5G-ERA project focuses on a multi-domain learning process for autonomous robotics using an intent-based networking approach for optimized resource management within the network validated by the use cases within the project enabling the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. Our central aim is to efficiently control and direct data traffic within the confines of the private network, ensuring it aligns with predefined objectives. While this methodology can be applied in various contexts, it is essential to establish precise intentions rooted in domain expertise. This innovative approach serves as a valuable complement to conventional network resource management methods typically employed at the network infrastructure level. © 2024 The Authors.

Studies in the field of AI currently focus on AI in business areas outside of marketing. Due to the increasing economic importance of AI in marketing, we address relevant influencing factors for AI use, potential AI applications in marketing, and the obstacles and opportunities associated with the use of this technology. Investigating this topic is particularly relevant for SMEs which lack resources and rely on cost reductions and prospective revenues through AI. This study consists of an online survey targeting marketing professionals in SMEs. The results show a strong interest among SMEs in adopting AI for marketing, but a significant gap exists between interest and actual implementation. Key challenges to its application include a lack of AI knowledge, a shortage of specialists, and inadequate data infrastructure. Our results show that, despite these challenges, marketing professionals see AI as a valuable tool for gaining consumer insights and enhancing performance management. Through this study we emphasize the importance of internal training, collaborative projects, and the formation of specialized AI teams to bridge the theoretical and practical application gap. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical, distributed, scalable and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based management of a massive number of network slices in different domains with the goal of zero-touch management is a major challenge for 6G networks. In this paper, we first propose a new vision for distributed network management and orchestration based on existing standardization architectures. This vision aims to embed AI/Machine Learning (ML) into the AI/ML architectures of Standardization Development Organizations (SDOs) such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Our second contribution is a numerical comparison of the benefits of the proposed distributed management and orchestration approach in terms of energy savings through Federated Learning (FL). The experimental topology includes a sophisticated infrastructure with VR streaming clients and servers, a monitoring system (MS), core network elements, aggregation server for federated learning (FL) and analytics engines (AEs). The deployment uses Kubernetes (K8s) and a top orchestrator that works together with an AI/ML model tailored to the envisioned use case. Experimental studies emulating the demanding Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming have demonstrated the effectiveness of the MonB5G framework in optimizing resource management, reducing overhead and improving energy efficiency. In particular, when convergence is achieved, the monitoring overhead is reduced by more than 11 times compared to the centralised SLA-constrained algorithm, along with data-driven management systems. This led to a more than 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency. At the end of the paper, we also discuss experimental results, VR video streaming specific challenges, scalability considerations and lessons learned throughout the implementation.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The escalating integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various domains, especially Project Management (PM), has brought to light the imperative need for inclusivity in AI systems. This paper investigates the role of AI software in augmenting both the inclusiveness and efficiency within the realm of PM. The research pivots around specific criteria that define and measure the inclusiveness of AI in PM, highlighting how AI, when developed with inclusiveness in mind, can significantly enhance project outcomes. However, there are inherent challenges in achieving this inclusiveness, primarily due to biases embedded in AI learning databases and the design and development processes of AI systems. The study offers a comprehensive examination of AI's potential to revolutionize PM by enabling managers to concentrate more on people-centric aspects of their work. This is achieved through AI's ability to perform tasks such as data collection, reporting, and predictive analysis more consistently and efficiently than human counterparts. However, the incorporation of AI in PM extends beyond mere efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in the epistemology of PM, calling for a deeper understanding of AI's role and impact on society. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI comes with significant challenges, particularly in terms of bias and inclusiveness. Biased AI learning databases, which use shared and reusable datasets, often perpetuate initially discriminatory algorithms. Moreover, unconscious biases and stereotypes of AI designers, developers, and trainers can inadvertently influence the behavior of the AI systems they create. This necessitates a paradigmatic shift in how AI systems are developed and governed to ensure they do not replicate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. The research proposes a methodological approach involving the development of criteria for inclusion and exclusion, alongside data extraction, to evaluate the inclusiveness and efficiency of AI software in enhancing PM. This approach is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges and limitations of AI in the context of PM. By focusing on inclusiveness, the study underscores the importance of a synergy between technological advancement and ethical consideration, demanding a comprehensive understanding and regulation to mitigate risks and maximize benefits. In conclusion, this paper presents a detailed exploration of AI's role in PM highlighting both its potential benefits and the ethical challenges it poses. The findings and recommendations of this study contribute to the growing discourse on the need for inclusive AI systems in PM, offering insights for AI developers and Project Managers (PMs) alike. © 2024 IEEE.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have become crucial enablers of this integration in this environment. They have been specifically integrated into the sixth-generation (6G) architecture to continuously improve coverage effectiveness. With an emphasis on the invaluable contributions of AI/ML to the world of 6G services, this research aims to address the complex issues associated with the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Additionally, it explores different possibilities, with a special emphasis on the practical approaches that AI/ML offer. In order to shed light on the difficulties and problems associated with this integration, the research offers a thorough overview of AI/ML-based solutions that can make it easier for terrestrial networks to be integrated into non-terrestrial networks. The roles of adaptive resource allocation, intelligent routing and handover, autonomous network operation, and effective spectrum management are highlighted in the research. These AI/ML-driven functions act as powerful catalysts, improving non-terrestrial networks performance, maximizing resource use, and improving the seamlessness of connections. Furthermore, they provide networks with the ability to make independent decisions, enhancing overall network efficiency and facilitating optimal spectrum allocation. By providing novel insights and outlining a course for future research projects in this field, this research considerably contributes to the depth of knowledge already known about the use of AI and ML in NTN integration.  © 2018 IEEE.},

This study examines the implications of integrating AI tools in software development projects, focusing on potential benefits, challenges, and perceptions of the broader software development community. The study employs a qualitative methodology that captures the sentiments and personal adaptive measures from a diverse group of industry professionals who integrate generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub’s Copilot in their software development projects. Findings suggest that generative AI tools aid developers in automating repetitive tasks, improve their workflow efficiency, reduce the coding learning curve, and complement traditional coding practices and project management techniques. However, generative AI tools also present ethical limitations, including privacy and security issues. The study also raises concerns regarding the long-term potential for job elimination (insecurity), over-reliance on generative AI assistance by developers, generative AI lack of contextual understanding, and technical skills erosion. While developers are optimistic about the positive benefits of generative AI use within project environments in the short term, they also hold a pessimistic view in the longer term. There is a need for the software development projects community to critically assess the use of generative AI in software development projects while exploring how to retain the critical aspect of human oversight and judgment in the software development process in the long term. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently made significant advancements and is now pervasive across various application domains. This holds true for Air Transportation as well, where AI is increasingly involved in decision-making processes. While these algorithms are designed to assist users in their daily tasks, they still face challenges related to acceptance and trustworthiness. Users often harbor doubts about the decisions proposed by AI, and in some cases, they may even oppose them. This is primarily because AI-generated decisions are often opaque, non-intuitive, and incompatible with human reasoning. Moreover, when AI is deployed in safety-critical contexts like Air Traffic Management (ATM), the individual decisions generated by AI models must be highly reliable for human operators. Understanding the behavior of the model and providing explanations for its results are essential requirements in every life-critical domain. In this scope, this project aimed to enhance transparency and explainability in AI algorithms within the Air Traffic Management domain. This article presents the results of the project’s validation conducted for a Conflict Detection and Resolution task involving 21 air traffic controllers (10 experts and 11 students) in En-Route position (i.e. hight altitude flight management). Through a controlled study incorporating three levels of explanation, we offer initial insights into the impact of providing additional explanations alongside a conflict resolution algorithm to improve decision-making. At a high level, our findings indicate that providing explanations is not always necessary, and our project sheds light on potential research directions for education and training purposes. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {While a digital transformation plan begins in the C-suite, it is in the implementation that project managers must grab the reins. Project managers, as the executive muscle of any business, are in charge of putting senior leadership's vision into action and delivering the company's new digital capabilities. Cross-team communication is one of the most significant areas where new digital technology is reshaping project management. When it comes to collaboration, traditional methods like email are inconvenient because they aren't meant for real-time communication. Important information is quickly lost in long email exchanges, and email saturation saps productivity. Collaborative work management software, on the other hand, allows team members and coworkers from other departments to engage, connect, and interact in real time, drastically reducing email clutter and saving time. However, these technologies do more than just improve the efficiency of intra-work communication; they also improve its effectiveness. A good example is the viability of AI as a transformation tool in several businesses. It has been effectively used and underlined in several businesses as important. The importance of AI can be seen in its wide and seamless integration across several sectors of business that ultimately helps them in the growth and expansion of their various services. This study therefore seeks to look at the influence of digital transformations on the overall outlook of businesses from various industries. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Using DAO, contributors get incentive tokens as a reward in return for contributions. The earned tokens can be used in the process of decision-making governance.

	abstract = {This paper conducts a systematic literature review on systems thinking (ST) and system dynamics (SD) applications in construction project risk and stakeholder management over the past decade. It evaluates current practices' alignment with SD, addressing project complexity and uncertainty. Seventy-three articles are analysed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, using descriptive, thematic and bibliometric analyses. Findings show fluctuating trends in ST and SD applications due to COVID-19 in 2019, with notable contributions from China, Australia and the UK. Building projects are the most studied, employing mixed methodologies. Thematic analysis highlights SD's significant role in system representation and risk management, with 80% of studies utilizing SD models for various risk factors. While less common in stakeholder management, SD enhances communication and understanding of stakeholder dynamics. The study advocates for integrating SD modelling in construction management for improved decision-making, risk mitigation and stakeholder engagement for project management practitioners, urging collaboration between academia, industry and policymakers for effective construction policies. Academics and researchers should focus on standardizing SD modelling tools, exploring hybrid methodologies like agent-based modelling, and integrating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance real-time decision-making capabilities. Collaboration between academia, industry practitioners and policymakers is crucial to ensure SD research translates into effective policies and best practices, particularly in safety and environmental impact assessments. © 2024 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study draws a qualitative and quantitative comparison between 16 human risk management experts from Finnish construction companies and the ChatGPT AI model utilizing anonymous peer reviews. It focuses primarily on the areas of risk identification, analysis, and control. Findings: ChatGPT has demonstrated a superior ability to generate comprehensive risk management plans, with its quantitative scores significantly surpassing the human average. Nonetheless, the AI model's strategies are found to lack practicality and specificity, areas where human expertise excels. Originality/value: This study marks a significant advancement in construction project risk management research by conducting a pioneering blind-review study that assesses the capabilities of the advanced AI model, GPT-4, against those of human experts. Emphasizing the evolution from earlier GPT models, this research not only underscores the innovative application of ChatGPT-4 but also the critical role of anonymized peer evaluations in enhancing the objectivity of findings. It illuminates the synergistic potential of AI and human expertise, advocating for a collaborative model where AI serves as an augmentative tool, thereby optimizing human performance in identifying and managing risks. © 2024, Roope Nyqvist, Antti Peltokorpi and Olli Seppänen.},

	abstract = {In the evolving field of Agile Project Management (APM), the role of the project manager is in transition. This paper identifies common ‘pain points’ in APM through a literature review and constructs a theoretical model to address them. The study introduces ‘Prompt Engineering’ as a novel approach to leverage artificial intelligence (AI), specifically ChatGPT, for mitigating these challenges. Empirical research evaluates ChatGPT's capabilities and reliability in managing various project tasks using engineered prompts. The findings suggest that while ChatGPT cannot fully replace human project managers, it excels in assisting, guiding, and automating specific tasks when guided by well-crafted prompts. As an outcome, prompt engineering patterns for project managers is proposed to facilitate the application of AI in agile settings. In this paper, we introduce patterns for requirements management, stakeholder and management teams and role clarification. The paper concludes that ChatGPT's knowledge is generally reliable but emphasizes the need for expert evaluation in critical areas. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {In the construction industry, traditional methods of cost estimation are inefficient and cannot reflect real-time changes. Modern techniques are essential to create new tools that outperform current cost estimation. This study introduced the Least Square Moment Balanced Machine (LSMBM), AI-based inference engine, to improve construction cost prediction accuracy. LSMBM considers moments to determine the optimal hyperplane and uses the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to assign weights to each data point. The effectiveness of LSMBM was tested by predicting the construction costs of residential and reinforced concrete buildings. Correlation analysis, PCA, and LASSO were used for feature selection to identify the most relevant variables, with the combination of LSMBM-PCA giving the best performance. When compared to other machine learning models, the LSMBM model achieved the lowest error values, with an RMSE of 0.016, MAE of 0.010, and MAPE of 4.569%. The overall performance measurement reference index (RI) further confirmed the superiority of LSMBM. Furthermore, LSMBM performed better than the Earned Value Management (EVM) method. LSMBM model has proven to enhanced the precision in predicting cost estimates, facilitating project managers to anticipate potential cost overruns and optimize resource allocation, provide information for strategic and operational decision-making processes in construction projects. © 2024 The author(s).},

	abstract = {The advancements of the 1980s led to the creation of various important technologies, including GPS and satellite imagery, which allowed for the sustainable management of land resources. This must be done while preserving sustainable landuse systems and confronting concerns such as climate change, water scarcity, and the risk of increasing erosion and productivity due to extreme weather events. In several areas, geospatial Big Data analytics is transforming the way firms’ function. Although there are many research workson geographic data analytics and real-time data processing of massive spatial data streams in the literature, only a few have covered the entire geospatial big data analytics and geospatial data science project lifecycle. Because of the volume, pace, and variety of the data being analysed, big data analysis differs from typical data analysis. In comparison to conventional data analysis projects, geospatial data science initiatives are likely to be more difficult and require advanced technologies. The current study introduces a novel geographic big data mining and machine learning framework for geospatial data gathering, fusion, storage, management, processing, analysis, visualisation, and land resource modelling and evaluation. Any data science project that has a robust procedure for land resource data analysis and clear instructions for comprehensive analysis is always a positive. It also aids in estimating the amount of time and resources required early in the process to gain a good picture of the land resource challenges that must be overcome. Automation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), drones, satellite imagers, and Big Data lay the foundation for a global “Digital Twin,” which will aid in the development of site-specific conservation and management practices that will boost incomes and ensure the long-term sustainability of land use/land cover systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cloud computing's offshoot, fog computing, moves crucial data storage, processing, and networking capabilities closer to the people who need them. There are certain advantages, such improved efficiency and lower latency, but there are also some major privacy and security concerns. For these reasons, this article presents a new paradigm for fog computing that makes use of blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI). OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this research is to create and assess a thorough framework for fog computing that incorporates AI and blockchain technology. With an emphasis on protecting the privacy and integrity of data transactions and streamlining the management of massive amounts of data, this project seeks to improve the security and privacy of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems that are cloud-based. METHODS: Social network analysis methods are utilised in this study. The efficiency and accuracy of data processing in fog computing are guaranteed by the application of artificial intelligence, most especially Support Vector Machine (SVM), due to its resilience in classification and regression tasks. The network's security and reliability are enhanced by incorporating blockchain technology, which creates a decentralised system that is tamper resistant. To make users' data more private, zero-knowledge proof techniques are used to confirm ownership of data without actually disclosing it. RESULTS: When applied to fog computing data, the suggested approach achieves a remarkable classification accuracy of 99.8 percent. While the consensus decision-making process of the blockchain guarantees trustworthy and secure operations, the support vector machine (SVM) efficiently handles massive data analyses. Even in delicate situations, the zero-knowledge proof techniques manage to keep data private. When these technologies are integrated into the fog computing ecosystem, the chances of data breaches and illegal access are greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: Fog computing, which combines AI with blockchain, offers a powerful answer to the privacy and security issues with cloud centric IIoT systems. Combining SVM with AI makes data processing more efficient, while blockchain's decentralised and immutable properties make it a strong security measure. Additional security for user privacy is provided via zero-knowledge proofs. Improving the privacy and security of fog computing networks has never been easier than with this novel method. © 2024 S.

This calls for research on the integration and evaluation of ML development practices within software companies. To investigate these issues, we conducted expert interviews with software and ML professionals. We structured the interviews around information systems development (ISD) models, which serve as conceptual frameworks that guide stakeholders throughout software projects. Using practice theory, we analyzed how software professionals perceive ML development within the context of ISD models and identified themes that characterize the transformative impact of ML development on these conceptual models. Our findings show that developer-driven conceptual models, such as DevOps and MLOps, have been embraced as common frameworks for developers and management to understand and guide the ML development processes. We observed ongoing shifts in predefined developer roles, wherein developers are increasingly adopting ML techniques and tools in their professional work. Overall, our findings underscore that ML technologies are becoming increasingl y prominent in software projects across industries, and that the incorporation of ML development in ISD models is an ongoing, largely practice-driven, process. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.},

The rise of AI in journalism fosters new challenges and opportunities for truth-telling and newsworthiness, two central concepts in journalistic practice. On one hand, AI can automate the detection of false information and increase the accuracy of fact-checking. However, the use of AI may also intensify issues of bias and discrimination, and there are concerns that AI may not be completely reliable in detecting truth. AI may preserve the dominance of established news sources and overlook underrepresented voices, leading to the “echo chamber” effect.

	abstract = {The poultry business in contemporary India is one of the most important and rapidly expanding sectors of the country's agricultural economy. Increases in chicken production can be attributed to better manufacturing methods and more efficient agricultural methods. The importance of automation in the current world cannot be overstated, and neither can the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) idea with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using a certain method, manual tasks may be made fully automatic. Poultry farms can benefit from IoT-based operations when remote monitoring and repair are required, transforming them from traditional to cutting-edge operations that make extensive use of automation. In order to maintain and enhance chicken health, it is necessary to constantly check for changes in a number of variables. In this study, we propose and construct a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for monitoring environmental factors in a chicken farm in real time, including temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, and light i ntensity. Information gleaned via sensors and continuous monitoring. By putting the planned system into action, we were able to evaluate its viability. Temperature and humidity levels, as well as their management, are the most important climatic parameters for a poultry farm's output. The purpose of this project is to automate the operation of a chicken farm by utilising Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

	abstract = {Open radio access network (O-RAN) has gained great attention owing to openness and intelligent management. To orchestrate and optimize mobile access networks with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, the O-RAN community standardized the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Owing to RICs, the mobile network operator can obtain more optimization solutions for classical use cases (e.g., ondemand traffic steering, anomaly detection, Quality-of-Service (QoS) management, and base station on-off policy). To intelligently control the network, RICs need to collect the data to make and verify the intelligent application. Thus, the O-RAN simulator is necessary for obtaining RAN data collection and testing intelligent applications in RICs. In this work, we develop a network simulation-3 (ns-3)-based novel O-RAN simulator by benchmarking the ns-O-RAN project. A real-world near-real-time RIC and ns3-simulated 5G NR gNBs are integrated through the E2 interface by exchanging E2 messages, RAN key performance measurements (KPMs), and RIC Control Messages. We implement the novel O-RAN simulator with ns-3 and present the experimental validation results.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The early diagnosis of lung diseases, including pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), asthma, fibrosis, and COVID-19 is critical for effective treatment and management. With the emergence of COVID-19, distinguishing between pneumonia caused by the virus and other respiratory illnesses has become increasingly challenging. Medical imaging, particularly chest CT scans, plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis. In recent years, machine learning and image processing techniques have been employed to aid in the classification of lung diseases using various medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and histopathology slides. Transfer learning, a powerful technique for addressing complex cognitive tasks, has shown promise in this domain. This study aims to utilize an Xception Model, a supervised neural network, to detect COVID-19 using CT scan images. Additionally, this project employs a Multi-class Xception model to differentiate between various lung diseases, including pneumonia, TB, influenza, cancer, and COVID-19. The methodology involves training the models on a dataset consisting of annotated medical images and evaluating their performance in disease classification. The results show that the proposed method improves accuracy in disease classification and provides valuable diagnostic insights for the diseases under study. The utilization of transfer learning with the Xception architecture enhances the efficacy of the models in accurately identifying lung diseases, including distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia and other respiratory conditions. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of AI-based systems for aiding medical professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of lung diseases.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Increasing expectancy for efficiency in the delivery of building projects and the adoption of lean production processes for construction has made the necessity for the development of an integrated system for cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and payments in the construction lifecycle important. Existing 5D BIM tools are used to estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of standardization in the use of model elements through the project lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined. According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of a cost estimation project. It was also revealed that 5D BIM improves project cost visualization and budget control. © 2024 The author(s).},

Unlike traditional OSSs, it is an open-source project where companies all over the world are collaborating to build different functionalities of an end-to-end Network operating system. For this reason, the ONAP platform has several different sub projects and APIs each performing a specific function to achieve Network Management. There is some complexity associated with using these APIs and knowing and understanding the many parameters associated with them, which impedes adoption. This not only prevents an end- to-end cloud service orchestration like experience for network services, but also increases the time and money spent on network orchestration. This paper proposes and discusses the design of a conversational AI solution that can interface with some significant APIs in ONAP to solve these problems. The conversational AI solution has the potential to significantly simplify network orchestration tasks.

	abstract = {Voting is a cornerstone of democratic societies, ensuring active participation and representation in decision-making processes. However, traditional voting systems face challenges like inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and a lack of transparency. In response, electronic voting has emerged as a promising solution. This project aims to create an intuitive and secure e-voting web application tailored for Covenant University’s Departmental Associations, fostering a fair and transparent democratic process, aligned with SDG 16: “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions”. By following the waterfall model for software development, effective planning, requirement gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment ensure a reliable and efficient e-voting platform. Skillfully built with Next.js and CSS for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, the application enhances user accessibility. Adopting a schema-based approach with MongoDB streamlines database management. The application is securely deployed on a cloud hosting service, utilizing a virtual machine for seamless operation. With the addition of AIoT, the IoT-enabled I-voting system gains new capabilities and functionalities. Furthermore, AI algorithms can aid in voter authentication, fraud detection, and result prediction, making the voting system even more efficient and reliable. The results obtained, including a remarkable response time of 97%, throughput of 95%, F1score of 99%, precision of 99%, and recall of 99%, validate the creation of a secure, accessible, and efficient platform for conducting elections. The implementation of two-factor authentication and real-time results has further heightened transparency while minimizing the risk of fraud. In conclusion, this project empowers democratic governance within Covenant University’s Departmental Associations, supporting Sustainable Development Goals 16 (SDG 16) vision of strong institutions and just governance. By embracing AIoT-enabled electronic voting, we actively contribute to advancing peace and transparency in our democratic society.

	abstract = {Construction projects worldwide consistently face the persistent challenges of time and cost overruns, wreaking havoc on budgets and economies. Effective mitigation necessitates identifying root causes—a complex task often dependent on deciphering project reports and subjective expert knowledge. Remarkably, there is a notable lack of suitable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for addressing the complex challenges in road construction management. This study addresses this gap by employing a large language model (GPT-3), which is an advanced language model, to develop an unbiased delay risk detection framework. This research methodology involved a comprehensive literature review unveiling the limitations of conventional approaches that rely heavily on subjective data collection methods. To address these shortcomings, the proposed framework automates the generation of question–answer pairs using ChatGPT, thereby ensuring data consistency and efficiency. Real-time project reports serve as the crucible to validate the system’s efficacy, resulting in impressive performance metrics: high precision for “Class 0 (No Delay)” (0.79), “Class 1 (Delay Detected)” (0.91), and “Class 2 (False Positives)” (1.00), high recall for “Class 0” (1.00) and “Class 1” (0.89), a balanced F1-Score (0.90 overall), and an accuracy of 0.85, emphasizing its ability to minimize both false positives and false negatives. This study explored the potential of AI-driven solutions, such as GPT-3, to contribute to advancements in construction project management. Our framework presents a data-driven approach for forecasting project delays, enhancing monitoring capabilities, and bolstering sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Python is one of the most widely adopted programming languages, with applications from web development to data science and machine learning. Despite its popularity, Python is susceptible to vulnerabilities compromising the systems that rely on it. To effectively address these challenges, developers, researchers, and security teams need to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks in Python code, but this is not an easy task due to the scattered, incomplete, and non-Actionable nature of existing vulnerability data. This article introduces a comprehensive dataset comprising 1026 publicly disclosed Python vulnerabilities sourced from various repositories. These vulnerabilities are meticulously classified using widely recognized frameworks, such as Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. Our dataset is accompanied by patched and vulnerable code samples (some crafted with the help of AI), enhancing its utility for developers, researchers, and security teams. In addition, a user-friendly website was developed to allow its interactive exploration and facilitate new contributions from the community. Access to this dataset will foster the development and testing of safer Python applications. The resulting dataset is also analyzed, looking for trends and patterns in the occurrence of Python vulnerabilities, with the aim of raising awareness of Python security and providing practical, actionable guidance to assist developers, researchers, and security teams in bolstering their practices. This includes insights into the types of vulnerabilities they should focus on, the most exploited categories, and the common errors that programmers tend to make while coding that can lead to vulnerabilities. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a common application for Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to provide language teachers with a simple to apply tool for topic model analyses to integrate into their classroom. The project also involves project based learning for students programming the actual AI web application. The original notion is to provide language teacher with AI methodology without requiring any technical knowledge in AI or any programming skills. Natural Language Processing provides various tools for word frequencies, but also topic modelling, allowing to track the relevance of topics over time in the media or in the literature. In collaboration with University of Technology linguistics, we intend to provide a corpus of classical English and German literature, as well as the option of uploading your own corpus which can be obtained from webscraping or other sources. A team of students of the vocational high school TGM Wien specialised in IT and Software Development is working on the design of the interactive GUI for this NLP application, learning in this way the methods of Natural Language Processing and Artrificial Intelligence in a project based setting. For this the statistical programming language R is utilized which already provides packages with implementation for Natural Language Processing and in addition the shiny package which allows to develop interactie web apps without additional web and app programming. A team of teachers supervises and supports the students during the development process, providing expertise in AI and NLP, in web and app programming, as well as server management. Two intended outcomes exist. Ont the one hand, we want our students to learn Natural Language Processing first hand through development of this application. On the other hand, we intend to obtain an interactive AI tool which can assist language teachers and their students on the long term in the classroom. In times of GPT3 and GPT4 dominating the media and perception of Artificial Intelligence, we intend to teach students about the methodology involved first hand by having them participate in the development of such an interactive application for Natural Language Processing. Through a project based learning approach, we involve them in all steps of the development over a times of one and a half years, two school years. The final product of this project is an interactive web application for topic modelling and visualising word frequency counts in various ways. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Such workflows often include multiple steps of classical simulations, but increasingly also ML and AI components. As a result, they use not only HPC, but also Cloud-like resources. Efficient and user-friendly execution and management of such workflows pose many challenges. In this paper, we share our experience in implementing three such workflows in the eFlows4HPC project. We focus, however, on the data management dimension of the workflows. How to ensure the timely availability of the required data, how to move data to and from compute resources, and how to make the workflows complete and portable. To this end, we implemented the Data Logistics Service, integrated it with the workflow execution engine, and defined multiple data movement pipelines to cater for specific scientific needs. We will share our experience from implementation and operation of the service. This will include building a solution for continuous deployment and access management in a federated environment. On a more abstract level, we also explore how the presented approach fits into the vision of the FAIR paradigm.  © 2024 IEEE.},

One of the most critical aspects is a reliable identification of litigations which can be successfully mediated outside court procedures. The decision is under responsibility of a judge/court who has to read hundreds of pages and several documents, to be able to take a decision on the basis of few statements. This paper describes both an artificial intelligence solution and a tool to provide a decision support system which could process documents and be capable to: (i) produce reliable suggestions, (ii) produce circumstantiated motivations, thus highlighting statements which could support identified suggestion focusing the work of any judge/court on actual statements and documents with relevant facts, and (iii) provide a web based tool producing suggestions and motivations on demand at service of the involved court and judges, compliant with privacy and security, as to data.

These deviations are subjected to condonation by the municipal commissioner if recognizable hardships are faced. The historical concession applications for similar cases are stored in an unstructured manner, creating a barrier to knowledge transfer. The subjective statements given by applicants are composed of logical structure, language, and embedded knowledge that requires years of experience from the domain expert to decipher. A knowledge graph (KG) representation of the problem can capture concepts and represent them visually, which is easy for novice stakeholders to understand. A Large Language Model (LLM)-based method is used in this study for ontology extraction in the form of concepts and relationships. Also, unstructured input preprocessing and entity disambiguation were performed to evaluate the applicability of KG in this domain. The performance of the proposed method was checked qualitatively in a case study from real-life project examples. The limitations and scopes for improvements were also highlighted. The outcome of this study indicates KG as a potential candidate for knowledge generation from the unstructured archival data of compliance checking. The target audience for this application can be the new architects, reviewers, and programmers working on developing the end-to-end automated compliance checking systems. Finally, applying these Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based knowledge transfer mechanisms can ignite future research on automated concession applications and approvals, laying a path to the digital transformation of the industry. © 2024 ISARC.

Additionally, the DISAC framework integrates novel waveform design with new semantic and goal-oriented communication paradigms, enabling ISAC technologies to transition from traditional data fusion to the semantic composition of diverse sensed and shared information. This progress facilitates large-scale, energy-efficient support for high-precision spatial-temporal processing, optimizing ISAC resource utilization, and enabling effective multi-modal sensing performance. Addressing key challenges such as efficient data management and connect-compute resource utilization, 6G- DISAC stands to revolutionize applications in diverse sectors including transportation, healthcare, and industrial automation.

	abstract = {The water crisis, global warming and climate changes have become recently prominent world issues. Saving and conserving water have become, therefore, an imperative for water resources' sustainability. In this context, dramatic innovations have come to light, e.g., Precision Agriculture. Numerous research projects on this subject have been conducted, as illustrated not only by the huge number of research works in this topic, but also by the dozens of surveys dedicated to. Surveys regarding smart agriculture are of two categories, surveys on smart agriculture in general in which smart irrigation is a subtopic among others, and surveys dedicated to smart irrigation. Existing surveys, however, suffer from limitations including low paper numbers, linear description without structural classification, and missing key information. To fill this gap, we propose, in this paper, a survey on SI that classifies the large body of literature into categories in a structured way. To this end, we have employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to determine the inclusion or exclusion of articles. We have reviewed a total of 610 publications out of which 227 met the inclusion criteria. We have categorized the selected references into three conceptual clusters corresponding to: (1) 41.8% focusing on field measurements, based on IoT sensors, (2) 37% involving Remote Sensing (RS) and (3) 21.1% Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. Each category is thoroughly described, including the inputs and outputs, along with a description of the various tasks employed in irrigation management. This systematic re-view is expected to serve as a useful reference for research on smart irrigation management methods.  © 2024 The Authors.},

The concept of AI in Project Management (PM) has been discussed since the 1980s, portraying AI as a tool with the potential to expedite, optimize, and enhance project management, aiding decision-making processes. Project management is a pivotal process in nearly every organization, and integrating AI into this process can offer numerous advantages, such as heightened efficiency, precision, speed in decision-making, and improved risk assessment. Data from Eurostat in 2020 indicates that only 6% of businesses in Croatia used some form of AI in their operations, reflecting the limited adoption of this technology in the business sector. This paper explores the current state of AI application in project management in Croatia, exploring both perceived benefits and barriers. A survey conducted in Croatia with 115 respondents revealed that currently, only 29.1% of correspondents utilize some form of AI in project management.

While combinations of vehicular sensors and AI offer promising prospects for advanced environmental perception, challenges still persist in accurately identifying dangers during the transition to automated traffic. The ESRIUM project, funded by the EU Horizon 2020 Programme, aims to address these challenges by developing digital maps representing road deterioration and employing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to generate infrastructure-assisted routing recommendations for CAVs. While the solutions for sending standardized safety messages and controlling enabled CAVs were demonstrated in the ESRIUM project, the solution for the automatic generation of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) safety messages was not studied. In this paper, we propose a pipeline named "ConnectGPT", which connects Large Language Models (LLMs) with CAVs, utilizing GPT-4, to observe traffic conditions, identify conditions that can endanger the flow of traffic, and automate the generation of the corresponding standardized C-ITS messages, such as Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) about the actual safety problem. Practical experiments with ongoing development show potential for real-world applications, which can significantly improve traffic management efficiency and enhance the security of all traffic participants, marking a crucial advancement in the integration of AI tools in ITS.  © 2024 IEEE.},

However, like any technology, they are not without their challenges. Assessing and improving performance in these systems requires an approach combining model optimization, the use of more efficient specialized hardware and intelligent management of computing resources. In this context, the final objective of our project is to develop and evaluate the performance of an embedded computer vision system via a deep learning-based approach: Application to the sorting and grading of agricultural products. To achieve the final objective, in this article we will first try to present and define the architecture of a type of CNN model, and we will build a fruit classification model based on visual appearance using the 'Fruits-360 dataset-Kaggel '.

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has profoundly influenced the technological landscape, reshaping various industries and applications. This surge in computational demands has led to the widespread adoption of Cloud data centers, crucial for supporting the storage and processing requirements of these advanced technologies. However, this expansion poses significant challenges, particularly in terms of energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. As the reliance on cloud data centers intensifies, there is a growing concern about the environmental impact, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of these computational infrastructures. This paper focuses on addressing the challenges linked to training ML and AI applications, emphasizing the importance of energy-efficient solutions. The proposed framework integrates components from the AI-SPRINT project toolchain, such as Krake, Space4AI-R, and PyCOMPSs. Our reference application involves training a Random Forest model for electrocardiogram classification, profiling available resources to obtain a performance model able to predict the training time, and dynamically migrating the workload to sites with cleaner energy sources providing guarantees on the training process due date. Results demonstrate the framework’s capacity to estimate execution time and resource requirements with low error, highlighting its potential for establishing an environmentally sustainable AI ecosystem. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and edge computing have recently emerged as major trends in the ICT industry. Enterprise applications increasingly make intensive use of AI technologies and are often based on multiple components running across a computing continuum. However, the heterogeneity of the technologies and software development solutions in use are evolving quickly and are still a challenge for researchers and practitioners. Indeed, lack of solutions tailored for AI applications is observed in the areas of applications placement and design space exploration with performance guarantees, both under-developed. The aim of the AI-SPRINT “Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum” project is to develop a framework composed of design and runtime management tools to seamlessly design, partition and operate Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications among the current plethora of cloud-based solutions and AI-based sensor devices (i.e., devices with intelligence and data processing capabilities), providing resource efficiency, performance, data privacy, and security guarantees. AI-SPRINT is intended to accelerate the development of AI applications, whose components are spread across the edge-cloud computing continuum, while allowing trading-off application performance and AI models accuracy. This is accomplished by the thorough suite of design tools provided by the AI-SPRINT framework, which exposes a set of programming abstractions with the goal of hiding as much as possible the computing continuum complexity, while further providing a simple interface to define desired constraints upon which the application design is guided. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The work presented here introduces a cutting-edge paradigm of a data-driven approach to Agile project management, contributing to the evolving research in project management methodologies. As organizations strive to consolidate the competitive market, their success is often measured by their agility and resilience. Such agility stems from the underlying management practices that an organization embraces and is crucial for the effective planning and delivery of large-scale projects. While management philosophies have continued to evolve, organizations specializing in software development have increasingly adopted Agile project management practices to keep up with a disruptive landscape inundated with rapidly emerging technological advancements. As organizations have continued to expand globally, the existing Agile practices have been laggard and sluggish, unable to keep up with the demands of a modern market.

	abstract = {Scaled agile development approaches are now used widely in modern software engineering, allowing businesses to improve teamwork, productivity, and product quality. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into scaled agile development methods (SADMs) has emerged as a potential strategy in response to the ongoing demand for simplified procedures and the increasing complexity of software projects. This paper explores the intersection of AI-driven assistants within the context of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) for large-scale software development, as it stands out as the most widely adopted framework. Our paper pursues three principal objectives: (1) an evaluation of the challenges and impediments encountered by organizations during the implementation of SADMs, (2) an assessment of the potential advantages stemming from the incorporation of AI in large-scale contexts, and (3) the compilation of aspects of SADMs that AI-driven assistants enhance. Through a comprehensive systematic literature review, we identified and described 18 distinct challenges that organizations confront. In the course of our research, we pinpointed seven benefits and five challenges associated with the implementation of AI in SADMs. These findings were systematically categorized based on their occurrence either within the development phase or the phases encompassing planning and control. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 15 different AI-driven assistants and tools, subjecting them to a more detailed examination, and employing them to address the challenges we uncovered during our research. One of the key takeaways from this paper is the exceptional versatility and effectiveness of AI-driven assistants, demonstrating their capability to tackle a broader spectrum of problems. In conclusion, this paper not only sheds light on the transformative potential of AI, but also provides invaluable insights for organizations aiming to enhance their agility and management capabilities. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The vision of 6G foresees telecommunication infrastructures that move from provisioning classical telecommunication and data services to delivering more intelligent, flexible and energy-aware services, opening up and exploiting new sources of information that link physical and digital worlds together. Sensing, localization and network self-organization are key enablers driving this trend. In this context, Research and Development activities focus on enabling sensing and high accuracy localization solutions either exploiting in-bound or out-bound network channels, while network intelligence emerges in various forms, among which as inherent enabler for network optimization, as facilitator of data management and analysis, and as part of service functionalities. These advancements are expected to make room for new roles in 6G ecosystems and novel use cases involving multiple service layer roles. This paper provides insights on preliminary sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled network capabilities to be adopted by 6G networks, as explored by the SNS-JU 6G-SENSES project, and touches upon potential changes in ecosystem formulations in support of forth-coming 6G use cases. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2024.},

	abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed an important increase in research focusing on how machine learning (ML) techniques can be used for software quality assessment and improvement. However, the derived methodologies and tools lack transparency, due to the black-box nature of the employed machine learning models, leading to decreased trust in their results. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we extend the state-of-the-art and-practice by building explainable AI models on top of machine learning ones, to interpret the factors (i.e. software metrics) that constitute a module as in risk of having high technical debt (HIGH TD), to obtain thresholds for metric scores that are alerting for poor maintainability, and finally, we dig further to achieve local interpretation that explains the specific problems of each module, pinpointing to specific opportunities for improvement during TD management. To achieve this goal, we have developed project-specific classifiers (characterizing modules as HIGH and NOT-HIGH TD) for 21 open-source projects, and we explain their rationale using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis. Based on our analysis, complexity, comments ratio, cohesion, nesting of control flow statements, coupling, refactoring activity, and code churn are the most important reasons for characterizing classes as in HIGH TD risk. The analysis is complemented with global and local means of interpretation, such as metric thresholds and case-by-case reasoning for characterizing a class as in-risk of having HIGH TD. The results of the study are compared against the state-of-the-art and are interpreted from the point of view of both researchers and practitioners.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

However, today many researchers, startups and innovative companies are starting to apply artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and other advanced technologies to the field of project management. By 2030 the industry will undergo significant changes. By using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol this paper explores the intersection of project risk management and AI. The study highlights how AI-driven methodologies and tools can revolutionize the way project risks are managed throughout the project lifecycle. Specifically, 215 papers have been analysed to explore how the scientific community has been moving so far on the topic. Besides, a cross-sectional investigation of the PM processes and AI categories/tools was carried out to identify any path that is prevalent, where the prevalence comes from, and for which PM process or sector it is most successful. Finally, from this study several gaps emerged that scientific research would have to fill to effectively implement AI in PM and that have been turned into opportunities for future research in the form of a research agenda. © The Author(s) 2024.},

While researchers predict that project management would “fit well” with emerging technologies, it remains unclear how this relationship would work in light of principle-based project management. This study fills this knowledge gap by analyzing previous research to investigate the influence of emerging technologies on shaping project management principles. We used the normative method preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to screen 1647 titles and abstracts and finally analyze 121 full papers. The study generated and discussed the effects of emerging technologies on project management principles. This contributes to our understanding of “how do principles guide us in carrying out our projects?” given the digital disruption of project management. We proposed future research based on two new principles, technology value thinking and technology leadership, and examined the dynamic role of emerging technologies on principle-based project delivery models.

This paper compares different algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision tree regression, XGBoost, random forest, logistic regression, etc., and based on the result generated the best algorithm will be used. The proposed smart agriculture system includes applications for crop recommendation, fertilizer guidance, plant disease prediction, and crop price forecasting and will incorporate these applications into a single website which later can also be developed and connected through the servers. This research provides the farmers with new and advanced information regarding their soil and field data. Through binding the power of data-driven decision-making, this project aims to enhance agricultural productivity, encourage sustainability, and empower farming communities.

The problem captured the attention of researchers and practitioners from an international and interdisciplinary GeoSen team. The project’s objective is to devise an IT system to identify land-use and land-cover changes with dedicated tools and computing algorithms. GeoSen uses remote-sensing data processed with artificial intelligence algorithms. Its macroscale research is intended to identify trends and changes in land management and landscape, while the microscale segment tests the IT system. Final algorithms will be published as an interactive online platform that will stimulate the activity of participants in spatial planning, leading to effective and sustainable use of space and its resources. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Autonomous decision-making is considered an intercommunication use case that needs to be addressed when integrating open radio access networks with mobile-based 5G communication. The robustness of innovations is diminished by the conventional method of designing an end-to-end radio access network solution. Through an analysis of these possibilities, this paper presents a machine learning-based intelligent system whose primary goal is load balancing using Artificial Neural Networks with Particle Swam Optimization-enabled metaheuristic optimization mechanisms for telecommunication industry requests, like product compatibility. We increase the proposed system's reliability by using third-generation partnership project standards to automate the distribution of transactional load among various connected units. This intelligent system encloses the hierarchy of automation enabled by artificial intelligence. Conversely, AI-enabled open radio access control explores the barriers to next-generation intercommunication, including those after 5G.

	abstract = {CNH is a global capital goods company of more than 37000 employees, specializing in equipment and services for Agriculture and Construction. CNHi vehicles cover a vast variety of applications, operating conditions, and environments, making design for reliability one of the main objectives of the company. Warranty claims analysis is a key activity for product support and product development technicians. A widely used source of information is a set of documents, referred to as 'Claim Comments' that are filled in by mechanics during repairs. Repair records include valuable information as failure modes descriptions, diagnosis and troubleshooting, potential causes, and other useful details. The information is then fed back for customer/field support and continuous product improvement. Claims details review is mostly executed manually, and engineers need to read thousands of lines each year. This task is constrained by human limitations - e.g., ability of consistently identifying failure modes and the limited number of documents that can be processed at once. This paper describes a solution to make that kind of massive documents analysis more scalable and efficient. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not a new discipline in data science; however, the problem was tackled in an innovative way using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a semantic approach instead of the classic frequentist one. This means that the analysis is not limited to single words occurrences but relies on the whole text context understanding. The core technology is based on a deep neural network called BERT [2] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which can read and understand the sentences, their context and enable the identification of the main topics in a set of documents. This solution can build topics-failure modes relationships, fostering an automated cross-system analysis previously unattainable. The developed application connects to the Enterprise Data System (EDS) through workflows embedded in a cloud-computing environment. The cloud environment allows managing large amounts of raw text, develop code, build data pipelines, schedule jobs, and manage distributed computer resources. The outcome is then delivered through dashboards that can easily convey the model's complexity in an interactive platform. Through the dashboards, users can analyze topics/failure modes across thousands of claims in a more efficient and effective way. The modular structure grants flexibility to the process, which is now able to adapt to different contexts and data sources. Main strengths of the developed solution are the automation and increased productivity for product support technicians, faster failure modes identification and prioritization and easier data exploration, presentation and sharing. © 2024 IEEE.},

However, the rapid ascension of AI and ML technologies that provide a foundation of groundbreaking capabilities need to be protected. Moreover, techniques that make AI and ML effective, efficient, and a force multiplier within the computing domain, and the central tenets of modern AI and ML technological advancement positioning them as the future of tomorrow, need to be safeguarded against exploitation and abuse by threat actors. Based on their ubiquity, embedded use of AI and ML within industry faces a major paradox; as AI and ML technologies empower and streamline operations while providing transformative benefits to users, they simultaneously introduce formidable threats through security vulnerabilities that can cause massive damage if not defended against. This discourse delves into cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent to AI and ML implementations within critical infrastructure domains of supply chain management and project management to explore how these weaknesses may be exploited. Further, we discuss ways AI and ML can be exploited by cybersecurity vulnerabilities within industry to compromise data and resources. Through a focused, multiple case study, we identify a serious flaw within AL and ML needing further investigation, identify data needing further examination, and isolate specific cybersecurity threats associated with AI and ML in supply chain management and project management, including exploitation of user vulnerabilities, use of AI and ML to bypass security measures, and use of AI and ML to automate attacks.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the context of the journey toward digital transformation and the realization of a fully connected factory, concepts such as data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and even predictive models emerge as indispensable pillars. Given the relevance of these topics, the present study focused on the analysis of customer complaint data, employing ML techniques to anticipate complaint accountability. The primary objective was to enhance data accessibility, harnessing the potential of ML models to optimize the complaint handling process and thereby positively contribute to data-driven decision-making. This approach aimed not only to reduce the number of units to be analyzed and customer response time but also to underscore the pressing need for a paradigm shift in quality management. The application of AI techniques sought to enhance not only the efficiency of the complaint handling process and data accessibility but also to demonstrate how the integration of these innovative approaches could profoundly transform the way quality is conceived and managed within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: To conduct this study, real customer complaint data from an automotive company was utilized. Our main objective was to highlight the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the context of quality. To achieve this, we adopted a methodology consisting of 10 distinct phases: business analysis and understanding; project plan definition; sample definition; data exploration; data processing and pre-processing; feature selection; acquisition of predictive models; evaluation of the models; presentation of the results; and implementation. This methodology was adapted from data mining methodologies referenced in the literature, taking into account the specific reality of the company under study. This ensured that the obtained results were applicable and replicable across different fields, thereby strengthening the relevance and generalizability of our research findings. Findings: The achieved results not only demonstrated the ability of ML models to predict complaint accountability with an accuracy of 64%, but also underscored the significance of the adopted approach within the context of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0). This study served as a proof of concept in complaint analysis, enabling process automation and the development of a guide applicable across various areas of the company. The successful integration of AI techniques and Q4.0 principles highlighted the pressing need to apply concepts of digitization and artificial intelligence in quality management. Furthermore, it emphasized the critical importance of data, its organization, analysis and availability in driving digital transformation and enhancing operational efficiency across all company domains. In summary, this work not only showcased the advancements achieved through ML application but also emphasized the pivotal role of data and digitization in the ongoing evolution of Quality 4.0. Originality/value: This study presents a significant contribution by exploring complaint data within the organization, an area lacking investigation in real-world contexts, particularly focusing on practical applications. The development of standardized processes for data handling and the application of predictions for classification models not only demonstrated the viability of this approach but also provided a valuable proof of concept for the company. Most importantly, this work was designed to be replicable in other areas of the factory, serving as a fundamental basis for the company’s data scientists. Until then, limited data access and lack of automation in its treatment and analysis represented significant challenges. In the context of Quality 4.0, this study highlights not only the immediate advantages for decision-making and predicting complaint outcomes but also the long-term benefits, including clearer and standardized processes, data-driven decision-making and improved analysis time. Thus, this study not only underscores the importance of data and the application of AI techniques in the era of quality but also fills a knowledge gap by providing an innovative and replicable approach to complaint analysis within the organization. In terms of originality, this article stands out for addressing an underexplored area and providing a tangible and applicable solution for the company, highlighting the intrinsic value of aligning quality with AI and digitization. © 2024, Anabela Costa Silva, José Machado and Paulo Sampaio.},

The findings suggest that AI development in the public sector is still immature, and few projects involving personal data have reached the stage of production. Political pressure to use AI in the sector is significant. Limited knowledge and focus on AI development among managements has made individuals and units with the resources and interest in experimenting with AI an important driving force. The study found that the journey from idea to production of AI in the public sector presents many challenges, which often leads to projects being temporarily halted or terminated. While AI can contribute to the streamlining and improvement of public services, it also involves risks and challenges, including the risk of producing incorrect or discriminatory results affecting individuals and groups when personal data is involved. The risk of discrimination was, however, not a significant concern in the public sector AI projects. Instead, other concepts such as ethics, fairness, and transparency took precedence in most of the project surveyed here. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {In today’s increasingly AI-driven world, there is a growing tendency to rely too heavily on generative AI and technical tools while neglecting the importance of proper data analysis. This scenario often leads to models that are overfitted and redundant processes. Therefore, data science needs to have clear goals and strategies in place. Especially when the low barrier to entry results in fewer feasibility studies, which, unfortunately, often produce poor data results. It is crucial to Regularize AI, assess practicality, and select techniques carefully to execute successful projects. Lack of sufficient data can result in bias and false positives. Thus, each case requires a careful analysis to choose the appropriate methods, algorithms, and frameworks. This paper emphasizes the importance of training intelligent models by exploring the potential of generative AI to enable models to learn problem-solving from existing knowledge. The text delves into the complexities of global data exchange through theoretical frameworks such as GDPR to guide data privacy and cybersecurity. It suggests solutions like VPNs and the significance of data quality and infrastructure through discussions on data lakes, big data, and data pipelines. There is also an emphasis on various model training techniques and common challenges in neural network training. The paper also underscores the importance of ongoing analysis and adaptation in a fast-paced world. It explores data management solutions and values user input and feedback. Suggestions include efficient practices and AI recommendations via data economy, standards, and regulations to reduce pre-work and analysis time. Innovations such as IoT, distributed computing, and AI-friendly databases are crucial for model training. It attempts to show how analysis and pre-work lay the foundation for continuous improvement by providing examples of modulated architectures and emphasizing the link between research and product value. In conclusion, technology advancements and developer contributions have propelled AI progress. This exercise strives to advocate for tailored solutions while anticipating AI’s integration with richer user inputs and intelligent analysis in robust systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Wildfires and related disasters are increasing globally, making highly destructive megafires a part of our lives more frequently. A common observation across these large events is that fire behavior is changing, making applied datadriven fire research more important and time critical. Significant improvements towards modeling wildland fires and the dynamics of fire related environmental hazards and socio-economic impacts can be made through intelligent integration of modern data and computing technologies with techniques for data management, machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, there are many challenges and opportunities in integration of the scientific discoveries and datadriven methods for hazards with the advances in technology and computing in a way that provides and enables different modalities of sensing and computing. The WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure took the first steps to tackle this problem with a goal to create an integrated infrastructure, data and visualization services, and workflows for wildfire mitigation, monitoring, simulation, and response. Today, WIFIRE provides an end-to-end management infrastructure from the data sensing and collection to artificial intelligence and dynamic data-driven modeling efforts using a continuum of computing methods that integrate edge, cloud, and high-performance computing. Through this cyberinfrastructure, the WIFIRE project provides data driven knowledge for a wide range of public and private sector users, enabling scientific, municipal, and educational use. This paper summarizes the talk reviewing our recent work on building this dynamic data driven cyberinfrastructure and impactful application solution architectures that showcase integration of a variety of existing technologies and collaborative expertise. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the motivation, framework, concepts, method, implementation, and results of the HCII2023 Design Café, a dedicated participatory highly interactive design workshop held in Copenhagen in July 2023. Motivated by the ubiquitous challenges our world is facing, this initiative had the goal to explore six main issues from an interdisciplinary perspective with a focus on the UN SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities” and the HCI Grand Challenge 2 “Human-Environment Interactions.” The six issues were formulated as questions and presented to the participants working in small groups. (1) How to create inclusive and ethical smart cities? (2) How to establish trust between people and smart environments? (3) How to address privacy concerns in smart environments that adopt the “disappearing computer” paradigm? (4) How to promote explainability and transparency of policies and measures to citizens of smart cities or in smart environments in general? (5) How to design incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior in smart cities at a personal as well as collective/corporate level? (6) How to measure success and impact in sustainable smart city projects? The method and approach of the Design Café is a tailored composition of a guided, structured format combined with and inspired by processes of informal communication and exchange of knowledge and ideas. Aligned moderation, a minimum set of rules, a set of relevant topics and an interdisciplinary group of motivated participants working in rotating formations provides the structure for achieving results. The results show that the six issues are not independent of each other, but require a holistic view, considering the various dependencies as well as synergies when exploring solutions. Nevertheless, the importance of first establishing higher-level goals based on ethical and inclusive approaches fostering human dignity and human rights were key. Acceptance of overall goals, processes, rules, and regulations was considered as the fundamental pre-requisite for sustainable change towards a declared goal. Acceptance needs trust and privacy as well as explainability and transparency of policies and measures. The role of incentives and rewards for engagement and sustainable behavior was twofold. Offering incentives must include planning on how to measure their impact. Effective measurement of success and impact depends heavily on how the institutions address privacy. Explainability and transparency should become one of the ethical guidelines that steer and control concepts, decision making, and implementations of all activities. The scale of these societal challenges still needs to be recognized by those responsible. It is essential to educate decision makers in the psychological needs and effects of sense making, comprehensibility, and finally acceptance and well-being moving towards a humanity-centered design. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {To support manufacturing firms in realising the value of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we embarked on a six-year process of research and practice to enhance the popular and widely used CRISP-DM methodology. We extend CRISP-DM into a continuous, active, and iterative life-cycle of AI solutions by adding the phase of ‘Operation and Maintenance’ as well as embedding a task-based framework for linking tasks to skills. Our key findings relate to the difficult trade-offs and hidden costs of operating and maintaining AI solutions and managing AI drift, as well as ensuring the presence of domain, data science, and data engineering competence throughout the CRISP-DM phases. Further, we show how data engineering is an essential but often neglected part of the AI workflow, provide novel insights into the trajectory of involvement of the three competences, and illustrate how the enhanced CRISP-DM methodology can be used as a management tool in AI projects. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to present a model of factors affecting the successful project implementation by introducing agility and artificial intelligence to increase the company’s competitiveness. In the model, the multidimensional constructs describing the implementation of an agile work environment and artificial intelligence technologies and tools were developed. These multidimensional constructs are agile work environment, agile leadership, agile team skills and capabilities, improving the work of the leader in the project, adopting AI technologies in the project, and using AI solutions in a project. Their impact on successful project implementation and on the company competitiveness was tested. The fundamental reason for conducting this research and developing the model is to enhance the understanding of factors that contribute to the successful implementation of projects and to increase a company’s competitiveness. Our developed model encompasses multidimensional constructs that describe the agile work environment and the utilization of AI technologies. By examining the impact of these constructs on both successful project implementation and company competitiveness, we aimed to establish a comprehensive framework that captures the relationship between agility, AI, and successful project implementation. This model serves as a valuable tool for companies seeking to improve their project implementation processes and gain a competitive edge in the market. The research was based on a sample of 473 managers/owners in medium-sized and large companies. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. In today’s turbulent environment, the results will help develop guidelines for a successful combination of agile business practices and artificial intelligence to achieve successful project implementation, increasing a company’s competitiveness. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As digital transformation reshapes business practices across numerous industries, a growing need exists to systematically characterize the intrinsic value of digital products and services (DPS). Value comparisons are central to prioritizing project backlogs for groups constrained by budget, headcount, or time. Rationalizing ongoing work also requires assessments of project value to support the decision to discontinue efforts, including those associated with long-duration R&D. A survey of recent literature reveals several proposed DPS value frameworks to address this business need. However, no unified set of value elements collectively defines the utility of individual DPS activities. This paper addresses whether a coherent framework can be derived from multiple disparate DPS value models within the publication record. The problem space is evaluated through a multi-disciplinary lens, using concepts from systems engineering, computer science, and project and portfolio management. Results from optimizing a design structure matrix (DSM), contextual clustering using a natural language processing (NLP) model, and evaluating a hybrid DSM with NLP-derived similarities all reveal the potential for a hierarchical value framework. Each level defines a different granularity of value decomposition. Firms may identify the framework complexity that best suits the needs of their organizations, enabling management to balance DPS portfolios and resources more optimally. Furthermore, the approach allows for flexible updates as additional publications come to light, shifting the focus away from a rigid framework and toward an evergreen perspective on work item valuation.  © 2023 The Authors.},

However, many organisations still struggle to adopt it successfully and empirical studies providing clear indications are scarce in the literature. This research aims to shed light on how AI applications can support OSCM processes and to identify benefits and barriers to their implementation. To this end, it conducts a multiple case study with semi-structured interviews in six companies, totalling 17 implementation cases. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model guided the entire study and the analysis of the results by targeting specific processes. The results highlighted how AI methods in OSCM can increase the companies’ competitiveness by reducing costs and lead times and improving service levels, quality, safety, and sustainability. However, they also identify barriers in the implementation of AI, such as ensuring data quality, lack of specific skills, need for high investments, lack of clarity on economic benefits and lack of experience in cost analysis for AI projects. Although the nature of the study is not suitable for wide generalisation, it offers clear guidance for practitioners facing AI dilemmas in specific SCOR processes and provides the basis for further future research. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms finds more and more its way into complex distributed systems. For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project “Very efficient deep learning in the IoT” (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The availability of digital infrastructures and the fast-paced development of accompanying revolutionary technologies have triggered an unprecedented reliance on Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques both in theory and practice. Within the AI domain, Machine Learning (ML) techniques stand out as essential facilitator largely enabling machines to possess human-like cognitive and decision making capabilities. This paper provides a focused review of the literature addressing applications of emerging ML tools to solve various Project Scheduling Problems (PSPs). In particular, it employs bibliometric and network analysis tools along with a systematic literature review to analyze a pool of 104 papers published between 1985 and August 2021. The conducted analysis unveiled the top contributing authors, the most influential papers as well as the existing research tendencies and thematic research topics within this field of study. A noticeable growth in the number of relevant studies is seen recently with a steady increase as of the year 2018. Most of the studies adopted Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Network and Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle PSPs under a stochastic environment, where these techniques are frequently hybridized with classical metaheuristics. The majority of works (57%) addressed basic Resource Constrained PSPs and only 15% are devoted to the project portfolio management problem. Furthermore, this study clearly indicates that the application of AI techniques to efficiently handle PSPs is still in its infancy stage bringing out the need for further research in this area. This work also identifies current research gaps and highlights a multitude of promising avenues for future research. © 2022 Author(s)},

This study explores the use of socio-technical systems analysis (STSA) in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform called Access-Risk-Knowledge (ARK) to go beyond established accountability frameworks by linking evidence, outcomes, and accountability. The aim of the ARK-Virus project was to use the ARK Platform to support mindful risk governance of infection prevention and control (IPC) for healthcare organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. ARK was deployed across three healthcare organisations: a fire and ambulance service, an outpatient dialysis unit, and a large acute hospital. Each organisation conducted an IPC case study, the three of which were then compiled into a synthesis project. A set of guidance principles for a pandemic preparedness strategy were proposed using the synthesis project findings. A Community of Practice (CoP) enabled the successful deployment of ARK, including intense interdisciplinary collaboration and was facilitated by practitioner-researchers in the implementing organisations. Data governance methods and tools supported a whole organisation and multi-organisation approach to risk. This first full implementation trial of the ARK platform deployed dedicated STSA within a semantically structured AI framework, demonstrating accountable risk management that addresses the complex antecedents of risk, links to evidence, and has the potential for managing the full cycle of risk mitigation and improvement. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project.

	abstract = {Due to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and their widespread use in applications such as ChatGPT, there has been a significant increase in interest in AI over the past year. Multiple researchers have raised the question: how will AI be applied and in what areas? Programming, including the generation, interpretation, analysis, and documentation of static program code based on promptsis one of the most promising fields. With the GPT API, we have explored a new aspect of this: static analysis of the source code of front-end applications at the endpoints of the data path. Our focus was the detection of the CWE-653 vulnerability—inadequately isolated sensitive code segments that could lead to unauthorized access or data leakage. This type of vulnerability detection consists of the detection of code segments dealing with sensitive data and the categorization of the isolation and protection levels of those segments that were previously not feasible without human intervention. However, we believed that the interpretive capabilities of GPT models could be explored to create a set of prompts to detect these cases on a file-by-file basis for the applications under study, and the efficiency of the method could pave the way for additional analysis tasks that were previously unavailable for automation. In the introduction to our paper, we characterize in detail the problem space of vulnerability and weakness detection, the challenges of the domain, and the advances that have been achieved in similarly complex areas using GPT or other LLMs. Then, we present our methodology, which includes our classification of sensitive data and protection levels. This is followed by the process of preprocessing, analyzing, and evaluating static code. This was achieved through a series of GPT prompts containing parts of static source code, utilizing few-shot examples and chain-of-thought techniques that detected sensitive code segments and mapped the complex code base into manageable JSON structures.Finally, we present our findings and evaluation of the open source project analysis, comparing the results of the GPT-based pipelines with manual evaluations, highlighting that the field yields a high research value. The results show a vulnerability detection rate for this particular type of model of 88.76%, among others. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword-based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development. Managerial Summary: Text-based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre-defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI-based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

The research model was based on a previous study of the ten project management knowledge areas presented in PMI’s PMBOK 6th edition, where project schedule, cost and risk management knowledge areas were identified as being the ones most likely to be affected by the development of AI. A group of graduates from a Master of Project Management program were assessed in an online questionnaire, reflecting the PMBOK’s elements of best practices and how AI will affect the project management profession in the future. Different elements of the three knowledge areas were considered to be affected more by AI than others. The schedule baseline is the element believed to be affected the most out of the project schedule management elements. For project cost management, the estimation of resource costs is believed to be affected the most. In the case of project risk management, the application of AI will have the strongest impact on the probability and impact formats. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This research full paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to support the study of software project management, considering the students' learning styles. The learning process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies significantly from one person to another. Everyone absorbs knowledge differently because each has learning characteristics that directly impact the learning process. Ignoring these differences can result in inefficient and demotivating teaching. Therefore, teachers must invest time in understanding each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, which can be overwhelming, especially in classrooms with a high student-teacher ratio. In this scenario, AI-based technology can be a strong ally. For example, chatbot technology offers an opportunity to adapt to these individual differences and to enable a more engaging and friendly approach for students, contributing to an active and interactive learning environment when exercising the role of a study companion and, why not, a bit of study guide. In this context, this paper proposes developing and applying a chatbot-based ITS called Juh to identify each student's learning style and, based on this understanding, present study activities appropriate to their learning style. The ITS uses meaningful learning theory to personalize the learning journey, detecting five profiles: active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. This study chose project management (PM) as its knowledge area, particularly project management methodologies, aiming to evaluate the benefits of this research proposal. In this context, this research proposes to answer the following research question: RQ) How can the study of project management be supported actively and interactively, considering the students' learning styles? As its main contribution, the solution aims to offer support in the introduction to the study of project management and improve the learning experience according to the individual characteristics of each student, maximizing the assimilation of knowledge. Therefore, the difference lies in exploring how and what to learn. The solution was developed using the Design Science Research method and the low code Blip platform. After prototyping and evaluating the ITS with PM and education experts, promising points about the approach were observed, with users highlighting improvements in productivity and ease of use of the tutoring system. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cataracts, a common eye condition characterized by clouding of the lens, can significantly impair vision and quality of life if left untreated. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating the detection of cataracts from medical images, particularly images of the eye's lens captured through various imaging modalities. This project proposes a DL-based approach for cataract detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a large dataset of labelled eye images. The proposed system aims to streamline the cataract screening process by automatically analyzing eye images to identify the presence and severity of cataracts. Additionally, to enhance accessibility and usability, the system incorporates a chatbot interface that allows users to interact with the model in a conversational manner. The chatbot provides real-Time feedback on cataract diagnosis, offers information about the condition, and guides users through the screening process. This proposed system produced an accuracy of 90% for cataract prediction. Key features of the system include the integration of state-of-The-Art DL algorithms for accurate cataract detection, a user-friendly chatbot interface for seamless interaction, and scalability to accommodate a growing dataset and diverse user base. The system holds the potential to revolutionize cataract screening by enabling early detection, facilitating remote monitoring, and improving access to healthcare services, particularly in underserved communities.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present time is a seminal decade for the transition of the energy sector through the deployment of green energy and the optimization of efficiencies using the power of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), which demands competitive policies to handle multidimensional endeavors via a single platform. The failure of energy policies can have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences when policies do not meet the energy and climate goals throughout the lifecycle of the policy. Such shortcomings are reported to be due to inadequate incentives and poor decision making that needs to promote fairness, equality, equity, and inclusiveness in energy policies and project decision making. The integration of AI in energy sectors poses various challenges that this study aims to analyze through a comprehensive examination of energy policy processes. The study focuses on (1) the decision-making process during the development stage, (2) the implementation management process for the execution stage, (3) the integration of data science, machine learning, and deep learning in energy systems, and (4) the requirements of energy systems in the context of substantiality. Synergistically, an emerging blueprint of policy, data science and AI, engineering practices, management process, business models, and social approaches that provides a multilateral design and implementation reference is propounded.

By harnessing the power of AI platforms in collaboration with government resources, our aim is to deliver effective and efficient solutions to combat plant diseases. Our overarching goal is to simplify the process of disease identification and treatment through the utilization of advanced technology. Our project harnesses various convolution neural networks, including VGG-16, ResNet, DeepNet, and YOLO V3. We intend to train our model using these convolutional networks and select the one that exhibits the highest accuracy for our specific project requirements. Beyond merely identifying the type of disease, our project also provides tailored remedies for treating these specific diseases. We leverage Chat GPT technology and collaborate with government platforms to achieve this objective. Additionally, we translate these remedies into local languages to ensure accessibility for those in need. Moreover, we employ text-to-speech conversion, enabling the vocalization of remedies.

	abstract = {The criticality of sustainable development to control the unprecedented consequences of climate change is clear. A vital element in launching sustainability projects is financing, especially for projects by small and medium enterprises. The first and crucial step to offering financing services for sustainable development is to identify and evaluate promising projects. The current practice to accomplish this step heavily depends on subject-matter expertise and professional networks. The current practice also involves extensive manual document reviews and subjective decisions. Therefore, existing methods are time-consuming, inefficient, and not scalable. This study proposes an automated system to identify potential sustainability projects for financing services using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The proposed method uses web crawlers and text mining solutions, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), to search the Internet, analyze text data, evaluate the information quantitatively, and identify potential sustainability projects for financing services. The proposed method was implemented and empirically assessed. The results indicate that the AI-enhanced system is able to identify and prioritize potential sustainability projects with 87% accuracy. The outcomes of this study will help financial experts and decision-makers take advantage of the information available on the Internet efficiently to improve the existing methods for identifying potential projects for financing services. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A critical concern with the UK’s construction project progress monitoring and control techniques is their dependency on data collection, which is time consuming and unproductive and may lead to various circumstances in managing projects. However, collecting and accurately analysing information from construction sites requires the development of technologies. As key artificial intelligence (AI) technology, computer vision (CV) is a powerful tool for big data analysis that can address the aforementioned challenges. This study explores the status of CV-based construction progress monitoring (CV-CPM) adoption and the main barriers to and incentives for its adoption within the UK construction sites. In this respect, after an extensive review of the literature covering the AI technology in construction management and the concept, function and usage of CV and its integration with construction progress monitoring, including its benefits and drivers and technical challenges, a questionnaire was administered to UK construction professionals to collect their perceptions. The study results indicated that construction practitioners were relatively aware of CV-CPM but lacked competencies and skills. CV-CPM has been perceived to be relatively better than the traditional approach. Implications such as the cost of implementation, lack of expertise and resistance to change were the major challenges in CV-CPM adoption. Meanwhile, technological development, decision making and competitiveness were classified as incentives for its adoption. © 2023 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The management of customer services by telephone encounters several problems: an uncontrollable flow of calls, complicated resource management, a very high cost of service, and more. Opportunities to improve the quality of service, save time and money triggered the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) based callbot. This article outlines the straightforward workflow developed to model the architecture of the callbot. Therefore, several algorithms were evaluated and compared based on real knowledge of a call center of an insurance society. The algorithms considered are: k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The comparison criteria are: correct responses, response time, accuracy, Cohen’s kappa and F1 score using n-gram (1.1) and (2.2). The results obtained show that the SVM (accuracy=70.29%) presents the best results on all the comparison criteria. The comparison between the results of the human agents and the callbot shows an improvement in several levels: the cost savings are greater than 80% on all the tests carried out, the holding time decrease to 0 seconds, and the processing time (almost a third or more). The results obtained sufficiently meet the objectives of this project. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

In this context, electronic commerce (hereafter e-commerce) platforms combining artificial intelligence (AI) and agile methods have been thriving. On the one hand, AI is a better way to process the data essential to platform customization and optimization. On the other hand, agile adoption ensures iterative software delivery as well as improved management practices that reduce uncertainty and allow SMEs to adapt more easily to new market requirements. A limited number of studies have covered all three topics, especially in relation to these companies. This research focused on creating an innovative model to identify determinants that favor or inhibit SME development of e-commerce, AI, and agile method projects. The model was developed using cognitive mapping - based on strategic options development and analysis - and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique. Recommendations were generated to help SMEs use these tools to acquire a stronger competitive position in global markets.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Organisations around the world are investing in implementing AI systems to improve their supply chain and become more resilient to pandemics and disruption. At the same time, practitioners are not fully aware of the factors that impact the implementation of these systems. Alongside this, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive study that evaluates the enablers impacting the implementation of AI in production systems. This research fills this gap by identifying, defining, and evaluating the critical enablers influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in production systems. We extracted twelve enablers, created a conceptual model, and categorised the enablers based on the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework. After categorisation, we used the analytical hierarchy process to assess the importance of the enablers presented in the model using data collected from eight experts. The results revealed that technology, as a category, is more crucial than organisation or environment. The findings also indicated that project management is the most critical of all twelve enablers. We discuss the implications of the analysis for practitioners and researchers. We also offer twelve propositions that researchers can empirically assess in future studies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, such as deep learning models, are increasingly used to determine risks in construction. However, the black-box nature of AI models makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of AI models is generated. This article addresses the following research question: How can we accurately identify the critical factors influencing tunnel-induced ground settlement and provide counterfactual explanations to support risk-based decision-making? We apply an XAI approach using counterfactual explanations to help understand decision-making surrounding risks when considering control ground settlement. Our approach consists of a: 1) construction of Kernel principal components analysis-based deep neural network (DNN) model; 2) generation of counterfactual explanations; 3) analysis of risk prediction and assessment factors' importance, necessity, and sufficiency. We apply our approach to the San-yang road tunnel project in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrate that the KPCA-DNN model better predicted ground settlement based on high-dimensional input features than the baseline model (i.e., AdaBoost and RandomForest). The bubble chamber pressure→ cutter-head speed→ equipment inclination is also identified as the primary risk path. Our findings indicate that using counterfactual explanations enables transparency and trust in AI-based risk models to be acquired. Moreover, our approach can help site managers, engineers, and tunnel-boring machine operators understand how to manage better and mitigate the risk of ground settlement.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the ability of organizations to accumulate tacit and explicit knowledge to inform management decision-making. Despite the hype and popularity of AI, there is a noticeable scarcity of research focusing on AI's potential role in enriching and augmenting organizational knowledge. This paper develops a recursive theory of knowledge augmentation in organizations (the KAM model) based on a synthesis of extant literature and a four-year revised canonical action research project. The project aimed to design and implement a human-centric AI (called Project) to solve the lack of integration of tacit and explicit knowledge in a scientific research center (SRC). To explore the patterns of knowledge augmentation in organizations, this study extends Nonaka's SECI (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) model by incorporating the human-in-the-loop Informed Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach. The proposed design offers the possibility to integrate experts' intuition and domain knowledge in AI in an explainable way. The findings show that organizational knowledge can be augmented through a recursive process enabled by the design and implementation of human-in-the-loop IAI. The study has important implications for research and practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To gain a deeper understanding of the issues that arise during these projects and the practices that contribute to addressing them, we study the case of Consult, a North American AI consulting firm that helps organisations leverage the power of AI by providing custom solutions. The management of AI projects at Consult is a multi-method approach that draws on elements from traditional project management, agile practices, and AI workflow practices. While the combination of these elements enables Consult to be effective in delivering AI projects to their customers, our analysis reveals that managing AI projects in this way draw upon three core logics, that is, commonly shared norms, values, and prescribed behaviours which influence actors' understanding of how work should be done. We identify that the simultaneous presence of these three logics—a traditional project management logic, an agile logic, and an AI workflow logic—gives rise to conflicts and issues in managing AI projects at Consult, and successfully managing these AI projects involves resolving conflicts that arise between them. From our case findings, we derive four strategies to help organisations better manage their AI projects. © 2022 The Authors. Information Systems Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation incorporates challenges that are unique to the context of AI, such as dealing with probabilistic outputs. To address these challenges, recent research suggests that organizations should develop specific capabilities for AI implementation. Currently, we lack a thorough understanding of how certain capabilities facilitate AI implementation. It remains unclear how they help organizations to cope with AI’s unique characteristics. To address this research gap, we employ a qualitative research approach and conduct 25 explorative interviews with experts on AI implementation. We derive four organizational capabilities for AI implementation: AI Project Planning and Co-Development help to cope with the inscrutability in AI, which complicates the planning of AI projects and communication between different stakeholders. Data Management and AI Model Lifecycle Management help to cope with the data dependency in AI, which challenges organizations to provide the proper data foundation and continuously adjust AI systems as the data evolves. We contribute to our understanding of the sociotechnical implications of AI’s characteristics and further develop the concept of organizational capabilities as an important success factor for AI implementation. For practice, we provide actionable recommendations to develop organizational capabilities for AI implementation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This full paper describes a complete article in the research category. This work presents a Bibliometric Review that aims to characterize the current scenario of academic research in Artificial Intelligence in education to support educators in the teaching and learning processes in Special Education in different contexts, becoming a tool with potential use in cases of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this sense, this work aims to contribute to a better understanding of research associated with the area of Artificial Intelligence aimed at educational processes involving students with autism. To do this, we used the EndNote reference manager, an online tool designed to support researchers in conducting Literature Reviews, following the bibliometric protocol proposed by Guedes and Borschiver (2005). From the definition of search strings, ('artificial intelligence') AND ('autism' OR 'ASD' OR 'autism spectrum disorder') AND ('education' OR 'teaching'), scientific databases were explored like Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, ERIC, Emerald, Scielo, Portal CAPES, and IEEE, to locate existing studies on the topic, between 2019 and 2024. As a result, 298 articles were mapped and 20 scientific works were selected that address the aforementioned specific theme, written by 89 authors belonging to 50 institutions in 19 countries on four continents, enabling the creation of a significant theoretical basis. By analyzing the information contained in scientific publications in this specific field, it was possible to infer that research is divided into distinct areas of concentration: 1) the exploration of algorithms and data analysis based on Artificial Intelligence for analytical-predictive issues in the field of special education; 2) the use of robots in the teaching and learning processes of students with autism; 3) the development of personalized educational intervention models for learning pedagogical, social and communication skills. The data show that research on the use of Artificial Intelligence in the education of autistic people can still be explored, presenting itself as a promising area for future investigations. The present study facilitates understanding of the current state of knowledge in this area, by identifying gaps in areas that require investigation, thus promoting the development of further research. Finally, the data observed with this research will serve as a basis for the development of future AI projects in the teaching and learning process for autistic students. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This innovative practice full paper presents an empirical study aimed at evaluating the potential of ChatGPT, an advanced AI-driven chatbot, as a supplementary educational tool in undergraduate Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) courses. The study, initiated in the summer of 2023, focused on assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in generating accurate and complete computer code, identifying and rectifying code defects (bugs), and its scalability in handling larger programs. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments with ChatGPT. In one experiment, we introduced bugs into small programs from introductory CSSE courses. ChatGPT was tasked with detecting these defects and providing recommendations for fixing them. We evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness in bug detection, the quality of its recommendations, and the completeness of the proposed solutions. We sought answers to questions such as whether ChatGPT found all injected defects, provided appropriate recommendations, and delivered high-quality solutions based on criteria like code completeness, size, complexity, and readability. In another experiment, ChatGPT was asked to generate code for assignments from previous CSSE courses, including Intro to Computer Science and Programming in C++, Intro to Python Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures using Java. We assessed the generated code's correctness and quality in comparison to student-written code. Similarly, in a third experiment, we evaluated ChatGPT's ability to generate larger programs using requirement specifications from an upper-division CSSE course on Agile Software Engineering. Analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data from these experiments during the summer, we determined that ChatGPT showed promise as an educational tool. Consequently, we developed a plan to integrate ChatGPT into select CSSE courses for the fall semester of 2023. Specifically, ChatGPT was integrated into two of our introductory CSSE courses enabling students to utilize it for debugging assignments and generating practice questions for exam preparation. In addition, we encouraged student teams in our EPICS (Engineering Projects In Community Service) course to utilize ChatGPT as a supplementary aid to help them find and learn any new programming languages or technologies needed for their projects. Anonymous surveys were conducted at the beginning and at the end of these courses to collect feedback from students regarding their experiences with ChatGPT. Initial responses indicated that students were generally familiar with ChatGPT and expressed curiosity about its potential utility, although some skepticism was present. However, by the semester's end, students demonstrated a positive shift in perceptions. They appreciated ChatGPT's assistance in rectifying code bugs, especially after-hours. Additionally, students valued ChatGPT for generating practice questions for exams, despite some inconsistencies in its responses. In our EPICS course, students felt ChatGPT was useful for learning new technologies, though opinions varied on its project management benefits. Lastly, the majority of students felt that ChatGPT helped them adjust to their work progress, showing its potential utility in keeping pace with ongoing projects. Based on student feedback, we propose integrating ChatGPT into future CSSE courses. Finally, as AI -based tools become more integral to academic settings, we believe that disseminating our experiences could potentially enhance engineering and computing education. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Construction workers' behaviors directly affects labor productivity and their own safety, thereby influencing project quality. Recognizing and monitoring the construction-related behaviors is therefore crucial for high-quality management and orderly construction site operation. Recent strides in computer vision technology suggest its potential to replace traditional manual supervision approaches. This paper explores research on monitoring construction workers' behaviors using computer vision. Through bibliometrics and content-based analysis, the authors present the latest research in this area from three perspectives: 'Detection, Localization, and Tracking for Construction Workers,' 'Recognition of Workers' Construction Activities,' and 'Occupational Health and Safety Behavior Monitoring.' In terms of the literature's volume, there has been a notable increase in this field. Notably, the focus on safety-related literature is predominant, underscoring the concern for occupational health. Vision algorithms have witnessed an increase in the utilization of object detection. The ongoing and future research trajectory is anticipated to involve multi-algorithm integration and an emphasis on enhancing robustness. Then the authors summarize the review from engineering impact and technical suitability, and analyze the limitations of current research from the perspectives of technical approaches and application scenarios. Finally, it discusses future research directions in this field together with generative AI models. Furthermore, the authors hope this paper can serves as a valuable reference for both scholars and engineers.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: The clinical documentation of cystoscopy includes visual and textual materials. However, the secondary use of visual cystoscopic data for educational and research purposes remains limited due to inefficient data management in routine clinical practice. Methods: A conceptual framework was designed to document cystoscopy in a standardized manner with three major sections: data management, annotation management, and utilization management. A Swiss-cheese model was proposed for quality control and root cause analyses. We defined the infrastructure required to implement the framework with respect to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. We applied two scenarios exemplifying data sharing for research and educational projects to ensure compliance with FAIR principles. Results: The framework was successfully implemented while following FAIR principles. The cystoscopy atlas produced from the framework could be presented in an educational web portal; a total of 68 full-length qualitative videos and corresponding annotation data were sharable for artificial intelligence projects covering frame classification and segmentation problems at case, lesion, and frame levels. Conclusion: Our study shows that the proposed framework facilitates the storage of visual documentation in a standardized manner and enables FAIR data for education and artificial intelligence research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

The analysis revealed key success factors in teamwork, including effective communication, apportionment of work, regular meetings, and high motivation. Barriers included poor time management, unproductive meetings, external obligations, and absenteeism. Course feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with students valuing the course structure, atmosphere, and lecturer. Suggestions for improvement focused on workload reduction. Then, from these 48 teamwork reflections, we identify requirements for developing an AI-enhanced game-based project simulation platform. The main goal of the platform is to enhance the Agile skills of the students.

	abstract = {This paper provides insights into a new methodology for monitoring and predicting known and unknown risks in the field of risk management in project management through Artificial Intelligence (AI). The novel methodology can significantly reduce the difficulty of using AI for risk management and thus maximize its spread in the private sector. A mathematical model is built by using AI to quickly screen potential risk factors and quickly determine the degree of correlation between each influencing factor and the observed risk. The AI is then used to continuously observe the influencing factors over a certain period of time, and the mathematical model is used to calculate the possible trend of the risk, and ultimately to know the exact impact of the risk before it arrives, and to prepare for the execution of the project. According to the case simulation, using this methodology, it was concluded that over the next year, the U.S. Steel Index would continue to decline until it reached a low of 630.61 in April, but rebounded to 1,428.95 just one month later, an increase of about 126%, with no significant downward trend in the coming months. Therefore, the project manager can avoid overspending the project budget by saving as much as possible before this risk arises, or by purchasing materials in advance. In addition, by forecasting, the project manager can raise the urgency and danger of the risk to the stakeholders, and obtain support for project changes in advance of the risk.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {5G brought an evolution on the network architecture employing the service-based paradigm, enabling flexibility in realizing customized services across different technology domains. Such paradigm gives rise to the adoption of analytics and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in mobile communications with the ease of collecting various measurements related to end-users and the network, which can be exposed towards consumers, including 3rd party applications. AI/ML may influence network planning and optimization considering the service life-cycle and introduce new operations provision, paving the way towards 6G. This article provides a survey on AI/ML considering the business, the fundamentals and algorithms across the radio, control, and management planes. It sheds light on the key technologies that assist the adoption of AI/ML in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks considering service request, reporting, data collection and distribution and it overviews the main AI/ML algorithms characterizing them into user-centric and network-centric. Finally, it explores the main standardization and open source activities on AI/ML, highlighting the lessons learned and the further challenges that still need to be addressed to reap the benefits of AI/ML in automation for beyond 5G/6G mobile systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The evolution of communication systems always follows data traffic evolution and further influences innovations that are unlocking new markets and services. While 5G deployment is still ongoing in various countries, data-driven considerations (extracted from forecasts at the macroscopic level, detailed analysis of live network traffic patterns, and specific measures from terminals) can conveniently feed insights suitable for many purposes (B2B e.g., operator planning and network management; plus also B2C e.g., smarter applications and AI-aided services) in the view of future 6G systems. Moreover, technology trends from standards and research projects (such as Hexa-X) are moving with industry efforts on this evolution. This paper shows the importance of data-driven insights, by first exploring network evolution across the years from a data point of view, and then by using global traffic forecasts complemented by data traffic extractions from a live 5G operator network (statistical network counters and measures from terminals) to draw some considerations on the possible evolution toward 6G. It finally presents a concrete case study showing how data collected from the live network can be exploited to help the design of AI operations and feed QoS predictions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has enhanced resource distribution efficiency in project management. Effective resource management is essential to the project's success since it directly affects the budget, the schedule, and the project's financial results. The function of AI in maximising resource allocation strategies is examined in this abstract, which also identifies potential advantages and disadvantages. Machine learning and predictive analytics are two instances of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that enable the analysis of significant amounts of historical project data, team performance indicators, and outside impacts.It is possible to do this by developing sophisticated models that can estimate resource requirements, identify potential roadblocks, and suggest the most effective influence strategies. Project managers can reduce the risks of over-allocation or underutilization by leveraging AI-driven insights to guide their decisions when allocating workers, funds, and other resources. Real-time monitoring and resource distribution correction while a project is in progress are also made possible by AI. To ensure that the resources are adapted to the project's changing needs, dynamic resource changes can be made in response to changing conditions. This adaptability increases the project's resistance because it lowers the likelihood of delays or exorbitant costs. The use of AI in project management, however, is not without its difficulties. It is important to carefully evaluate ethical issues including data privacy, bias reduction in algorithmic decision-making, and openness in the justification for resource allocation. Additionally, organisations must spend money on technology infrastructure, personnel training, and change management procedures in order to implement AI. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the most prominent topics addressed by national AI policies, as well as their relative importance across nations. This paper integrates the results of a topic modeling analysis of 30 national AI policies with a qualitative content analysis of the policies. Based on this analysis, fourteen main common themes have been identified among national AI policies, which predominantly relate to educational, technological, government, ethical/legal, and social good concerns. Following this, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of topics across countries to determine the extent of topic prioritization in each country. In this investigation, several marginalized AI policy topics were also identified. In general, the challenges and concerns of the majority of policies pertain to education, technology, and the government. Governments refer to real-world projects and investments in AI technologies without developing shared digital governance platforms that promote responsible and sustainable AI among technology titans and mitigate the negative effects of surveillance capitalism. Although governments acknowledge the ethical and legal aspects of AI development and frequently cite the GDPR, they limit their discussion to the data level, particularly data sharing, and marginalize ethical algorithms and other phases of data and AI management and design. In addition, government policies marginalize AI startups and the API economy, even though they play a crucial role in fostering the AI ecosystem. The paper contributes to the existing literature on AI policy and will serve as a guide for AI policymakers to help them better understand the topical similarities across countries and the neglected or marginalized challenges that require further attention. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In order to keep expenses in check while building projects are being carried out, accurate cash flow forecasting is crucial. The project's unique features and risk considerations make it challenging, despite extensive study, to develop a reliable model for predicting future cash flows. Furthermore, both sequence and non-sequence elements have a significant influence on the building projects' cash flow. As a result, the authors of this research suggested a new inference model based on artificial intelligence (AI) called Evolutionary Gravity Neocognitron Neural Network (EG-NN). This model takes project complexity into account and attempts to handle non-sequence elements in time series issues. By attaining the highest values of 2.35%, MAPE of 5.65%, MAE of 2.03%, and coefficient of determination of 0.99, the experimental findings on thirteen construction projects have validated the EG-NN as the top model for cash flow forecasting. When compared to other AI-based inference models, the statistical result shows that cash flow forecasting can be improved by at least 14.1 percent in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 15.2 percent in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). Managers may benefit from the EG-NN network model's ability to predict and manage construction projects' cash flow. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Generative AI is about to radically transform the way intellectual and creative work is being done. Since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, the potential impact of generative AI tools on higher education has been intensively debated. ChatGPT can generate well-formulated human-like text passages and conversations that is often, but not always, of a surprisingly high quality. This paper reports on an early experiment to explore ways in which ChatGPT can be used in the higher education context. The experiment involved a written assignment which required postgraduate Information Systems students to formulate a critique of the outputs of ChatGPT to a specific question in Information Systems project management. The paper investigates the level of criticality that the students demonstrated in working with ChatGPT and assessing the quality of its outputs. It further explores the claim that ChatGPT can be used to generate rubrics and assess students’ assignments by asking ChatGPT to produce a rubric for critical thinking and assess the students’ assignments against the rubric produced. The findings indicate that students perceive the ChatGPT produced responses as generally accurate, although they tend to lack depth, with some key information omitted, produced biased responses and have limitations with academic writing conventions. The rubric that ChatGPT produced for assessing critical thinking is lacking in certain areas and the reliability of using it as an assessment tool is questionable given the inconsistency in the results. Overall, the paper concludes that while ChatGPT and other text generative AI can be useful learning and teaching companions for both students and lectures, human expertise and judgement is needed in working with ChatGPT. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Over the years, AI has been utilized as a powerful tool to address complex challenges in the AEC industry. In the current AI practices, machines predominantly plan, manage, control, and optimize work without appropriately considering human-related input and preferences. However, architects, engineers, managers, clients, and other decision makers should consider their input into their work to better generate their desired ideas, prototypes, and solutions. In addition, significant decisions in the AEC industry are mainly reliant on the heuristic processes where assumptions are developed from past experience. However, the current level of AI is not able to properly deal with such human information and experience. This fact especially in large projects can result in a failure to properly utilize the full benefits of AI. Thus, human-centered AI is an essential need to help the machines understand and utilize human input for amplifying human abilities and reflecting realistic conceptions in the AEC industry. This paper presents the major aspects and applications of human-centered AI in the AEC industry and discusses the anticipated benefits and challenges of this technology. Human-centered AI, mainly via natural language processing and machine reading comprehension, can understand and learn from human interests, preferences, languages, and behaviors for providing human-centered environments, systems, and approaches that satisfy human interests and preferences. As the major benefits, human-centered AI is expected to result in architectural processing optimization, design and engineering capability enhancement, data driven project management, collaboration improvement, and safety enhancement. Personalization of human-centered AI and training its systems are considered as the major challenges in developing this technology in the AEC industry. In addition, AEC-specific guidelines and statements should be regulated in developing human-centered AI utilized in hazardous areas. Human-centered AI is anticipated to provide the highest level of human control in the current fast-growing automation of the AEC industry. © 2023 The Authors},

The several ways that artificial intelligence and automation have affected human resources (HR) in the manufacturing sector is the focus of this research paper Its goal is to throw attention on the chances and difficulties still to arise. This research project employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with executives from manufacturing firms and human resource professionals with quantitative questionnaires. The results show a scene in which artificial intelligence and automation have already started to change manufacturing industry human resource roles. The automation of jobs like payroll processing and candidate screening for employment has made workforce reallocation and chances for upskill possible. After the study ends, a set of suggestions relevant to legislators, manufacturers, and human resource managers is offered. This emphasizes the need of proactive human resource plans that see artificial intelligence and automation as tools to improve the workforce rather than as tools to replace it.

It originated from the desire to understand the potential of true robotic surgery, as existing robotic systems are tele-manipulators rather than autonomous robots. AI’s role in surgery involves levels of autonomy and a balance between human expertise and technological advancements. In this regard, a new field of Surgiomics emerges, integrating patient data such as genomics, radiomics, and pathomics to enhance surgical decision-making. Overcoming limitations in surgical data analysis, AI processes vast amounts of data, detects subtle patterns, and explores complex relationships. As Surgiomics continues to evolve, it holds the potential to reshape surgical patient management. Initiatives like the Artificial intelligence, Radiomics, Genomics, Oncopathomics and Surgomics (AiRGOS) Project aim to develop AI algorithms for precision therapeutic treatments in cancer patients using radiologic imaging, genomic sequencing, and clinical data. In this commentary, we envision a future where AI technologies revolutionize surgical decision-making and create personalized treatment plans based on comprehensive patient data. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has had a profound impact on various aspects of business and technology. One area greatly influenced by AI is innovation project management, which plays a critical role in driving organizational growth and success. The purpose of the paper examines the erosion of competencies in innovation project management as a consequence of the increasing reliance on AI systems. The object is innovation project management relying on the expertise, experience, and decision-making capabilities of human managers. However, the introduction of AI systems in project management processes has brought about significant changes. AI-powered tools and algorithms can automate tasks, analyse vast amounts of data, and provide valuable insights and recommendations. While this presents numerous benefits, it also raises concerns about the diminishing role of human competencies in managing innovation projects. AI systems require vast amounts of training data to operate effectively. In the process, they might overlook or undervalue the tacit knowledge and domain expertise possessed by human project managers. The results emphasize the need for project managers to develop new competencies, such as understanding AI capabilities, interpreting AI-generated insights, and effectively integrating AI systems into project workflows. To mitigate the erosion of competencies, organizations should invest in training programs that equip project managers with the necessary skills to work alongside AI systems. Recognizing these challenges and proactively addressing them through training, collaboration, and a balanced approach to human-AI interaction is crucial for organizations seeking to leverage AI while maintaining a high level of project management expertise. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to wireless technology, specifically in the context of beam management (BM) in the advanced 5th-generation (5G) communication system. Our focus lies in aligning our study with the ongoing discussions within the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as of December 2022. Instead of evaluating the performance of specific AI models, we take user equipment (UE) receiver (Rx) beam prediction as an illustrative example of AI-based BM. We explore various aspects of AI model management, including model selection, monitoring, and activation/deactivation operations, from a 3GPP perspective. For model selection, we propose deploying distinct AI models for different propagation environments, categorized based on base station (BS) transmitter (Tx) beam measurement results. Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) serves as a pivotal key performance index (KPI) for model performance monitoring. Our simulation results indicate that, instead of training one all-encompassing AI model with numerous layers for universal application, transitioning between domain-specific AI models with fewer layers yields superior performance. Model activation/deactivation procedures determine whether AI-based BM or traditional BM should be employed in a given scenario. We also introduce the use of AI for predicting the performance of both AI-based BM and traditional BM. By comparing the performance of these strategies, we can ascertain whether link performance degradation results from AI output errors or UE movement into challenging propagation environments. This approach enables the effective management of model switching between AI-based BM and traditional BM. The simulation shows that we can reduce the number of unnecessary switches by 10%.  © 2020 IEEE.},

When several activities undermine the accessibility, privacy, or reliability of a computer system resource, a compromise is detected. Intrusion Detection Systems warn management stations when they identify unusual network or system activities, such as security policy violations. Cyber networks send too much data for real-time detection of threats. The project focuses on detecting cyber threats using artificial neural networks. Checking user behavior for abnormalities may help spot fraud. How systems can detect new vulnerabilities and respond to mitigate or eliminate threats is a major cyber security topic. Detecting unfriendly nodes before they can interact prevents cyber assaults, requiring sophisticated safety measures. A self- replication technique for spotting network breaches using dynamically intrusion pattern identification and quick node activity analysis is proposed in this paper. This paradigm reduces false positives in highly dynamic systems with frequent behavior changes. Dynamic malware analysis and node behavior may properly identify malware. Alerts given when anything risky happens allow instantaneous delivery of solutions to other systems and avoidance of assaults on various systems. The self-healing technology protects the network against malicious applications. The healing themselves model protects the system from infections by malware and information loss with 98% accuracy, while the proposed model analyzes patterns dynamically with 98.4% accuracy. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective progress monitoring is ineviTable for completing the construction of building and infrastructure projects successfully. In this digital transformation era, with the data-centric management and control approach, the effectiveness of monitoring methods is expected to improve dramatically. ”Digital Twin,” which creates a bidirectional communication flow between a physical entity and its digital counterpart, is found to be a crucial enabling technology for information-aware decision-making systems in manufacturing and other automotive industries. Recognizing the benefits of this technology in production management in construction, researchers have proposed Digital Twin Construction (DTC). DTC leverages building information modeling technology and processes, lean construction practices, on-site digital data collection mechanisms, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based data analytics for improving construction production planning and control processes. Progress monitoring, a key component in construction production planning and control, can significantly benefit from DTC. However, some knowledge gaps still need to be filled for the practical implementation of DTC for progress monitoring in the built environment domain. This research reviews the existing vision-based progress monitoring methods, studies the evolution of automated vision-based construction progress monitoring research, and highlights the methodological and technological knowledge gaps that must be addressed for DTC-based predictive progress monitoring. Subsequently, it proposes a framework for closed-loop construction control through DTC. Finally, the way forward for fully automated, real-time construction progress monitoring built upon the DTC concept is proposed. © 2023},

In this context, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to each risk management sub-process were determined, and then a questionnaire that consisted of prompt templates was prepared for collecting data from ChatGPT. Afterwards, ChatGPT’s responses were evaluated by experts with focus group sessions. The findings indicate that ChatGPT has a moderate level of performance in managing risks. It provides more accurate knowledge in risk response and risk monitoring rather than risk identification and risk analysis sub-processes. This research paves the way for future studies by demonstrating an implication of ChatGPT use for risk-based decision making.

Humanitarian crises exemplify such situations, and the pervasiveness of social media renders it one of the most abundant sources of real-time information available. However, it is quite a difficult task to condense a body of social media posts into useful information quickly. In this paper we consider the challenge of using social media reports to provide a reliable, real-time situational awareness in the management of humanitarian crises. Effectively addressing this challenge requires extracting only the relevant information out of text and images in individual social media posts, fusing this information together into actionable information points for decision makers, and providing an assessment of the trustworthiness of this information. We propose a general solution framework and discuss a system developed in collaboration with NATO which combines state-of-the-art deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and information fusion models to provide a reliable, actionable, real-time situational awareness for supporting decision making in humanitarian crisis logistics. In addition to the technical approach, we also discuss important practical aspects of this project including the development and validation process, challenges encountered along the way, and key lessons learned.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Application of emerging digital technology (DT) is an attractive subject of research and is indispensable to the current goal of intelligent construction in many countries. Relevant studies have either focused on the status of a specific DT or proposed preliminary/qualitative comparisons among DTs. This paper provides a systematic understanding of research on applying DTs to the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry using a mixed-review method. Ten emerging DTs are determined, and publications related to them in 2011-2020 are collected from the Scopus database. The overall status and comparisons of research on 10 emerging DTs by region, journal, and popularity are then presented. The content of research on them is examined through in-depth literature analysis (including research scenario, project stage, and literature evolution in a discipline) and theme classification. Future research directions including technology knowledge, development, application and management, and some practical implications for the country, industry, project, and enterprise, are finally proposed. This research will be informative for academics with regard to the emerging DT's opportunities in this discipline and provide support for work on the digitization of the AECO industry. Practical Applications Some practical implications are proposed from the perspectives of the country, industry, project, and enterprise. For the government, the holistic planning and scientific coordination of emerging DTs need to be highlighted, such as vigorously promoting Building Information Modelling (BIM) and artificial intelligence (AI) and utilizing them to further support the progress of blockchain and digital twin. Establishing demonstration projects to play their radiating roles and accelerate the inter-regional promotion of emerging DTs is also effective. For the industry, it is suggested to build technology alliances to jointly develop integrated platforms covering multiple emerging DTs through in-depth synergy; industry associations are advised to strengthen knowledge diffusion and accumulation for emerging DTs through sharing and training. For projects, applying emerging DTs to the entire life of projects and making them be deeply integrated with off-site, lean, and green construction are advisable. For enterprises, improving the workflow and management model adapted to the application of emerging DTs is necessary. Through adjusting organizational structure and transforming corporate culture, the competitiveness of enterprises could be continuously improved.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The construction phase of nuclear construction projects presents various risks and hazards, putting workers in potentially dangerous situations. Safety guidelines provided by Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) aim to address construction safety concerns, but limitations persist, especially in the context of workers safety and the transportation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Micro Reactors (MRs) in the nuclear construction domain. This research focuses on identifying issues related to safety guidelines in nuclear construction and aims to develop new guidelines and strengthen existing ones. Through a critical literature review, key factors influencing safety in nuclear construction were identified. A questionnaire survey was prepared in line with those identified key safety factors and distributed among 40 professionals from the United States to gather feedback on these factors in countering safety issues and developing new guidelines in the context of nuclear construction. The findings reveal a lack of specific guidelines concerning the safe transportation of SMRs and MRs, as well as a gap in understanding accidents during the construction and transportation phases of nuclear projects. The results of this research contribute to enhancing safety protocols and addressing the unique challenges faced in nuclear construction. The research has also highlighted the importance of digital technology tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as emerging digital tools, which could be helpful to counter safety concerns linked to SMRs and MRs in future.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to show how machine learning can be leveraged as a tool to govern social impact and drive fair and equitable investments. Many organizations today are establishing financial inclusion goals to promote social impact and have been increasing their investments in this space. Financial inclusion is the opportunity for individuals and businesses to have access to affordable financial products including loans, credit, and insurance that they may otherwise not have access to with traditional financial institutions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending serves as a platform that can support and foster financial inclusion and influence social impact and is becoming more popular today as a resource to underserved communities. Loans issued through P2P lending can fund projects and initiatives focused on climate change, workforce diversity, women’s rights, equity, labor practices, natural resource management, accounting standards, carbon emissions, and several other areas. With this in mind, AI can be a powerful governance tool to help manage risks and promote opportunities for an organization’s financial inclusion goals. In this paper, we explore how AI, specifically machine learning, can help manage the P2P platform Kiva’s investment risks and deliver impact, emphasizing the importance of prediction model retraining to account for regulatory and other changes across the P2P landscape to drive better decision-making. As part of this research, we also explore how changes in important model variables affect aggregate model predictions. © 2023 by the authors.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer experience. Thus, it is crucial to forming project teams in an organization, in such a way that they will welcome AI in the decision-making process. The current technological revolution is demanding a rapid pace of change to companies and has increased the attention to the role of teams in fostering innovation adoption. We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources' cost and human-machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Management system as a form of organising chaos and complexity becomes the only platform to design business and to make it sustainable irrespective of location and personalities engaged. At the time of the world economy demand for social actors, activism in the necessary transition of management oriented to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is a crucial factor to form the new management digitized system. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Investing managed assets as a part of all corporate assets. ESG initiative was a proposal of the UN to promote principles for a sustainable economy. Companies with better ESG performance can increase shareholders’ value by managing risks related to emerging ESG issues, namely bring the corporation to have energy transition experience. Different approaches of millennials to managing enterprises show their higher interest than that of predecessors to introduce ESG standards and tasks to the day-to-day management. Millennials are more interested in social values than in the investment return. Even the future of investments is dependent on the basic idea that investors are not short-termist but tend to be loyal to a project about which they have more relevant information. So, they may support new AI-based management in the case it becomes an efficient platform to design a human-oriented enterprise. This study aims at showing what the relationship of the management structure and process should be in order to manage the AI progress.

Our model functions as expected according to these data, which demonstrate a robust relationship between geographical area and water level. An efficient and accurate training model will be developed for the next generation. Estimating groundwater has unique challenges. Complex designs, ethical quandaries surrounding data use, and improving data quality are all obstacles. We suggest ways to improve the device's design, make it easier to disassemble, and offer information instantly as part of our cooperation. It is critical that our project uses geographic data to evaluate the performance model.

	abstract = {The integration of cross-company activities to form global supply chains (SC) has several benefits, including reducing costs, minimizing energy and resource waste, and promoting relationships for improving all network actors. However, as the number of tiers of suppliers and customers increases, monitoring processes and identifying problems becomes more challenging, which can threaten the continuity of the SC. To address this issue, the EU knowlEdge project proposes using artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that are distributed, scalable, and collaborative to enable automatic monitoring and learning in the SC. This approach replaces rigid organization with flexible networks that leverage self-learning algorithms and automatic value creation, thereby facilitating knowledge sharing. The project unifies technologies from various domains, including AI, data analytics, edge, and cloud computing, into a software architecture that offers a systemic solution rather than an incremental improvement. This architecture enhances SC performance, including adaptability and autonomy, and enables industry to adopt adaptive strategies. The platform’s functionality is tested in manufacturing, where it will improve production monitoring and planning and enable human intervention and learning. The AI application is expected to increase performance on various business and production indicators, which will also have an impact beyond the factory floor. With this approach, managers can respond quickly to changing customer requirements, while deviations in planned processes can be addressed more effectively. Additionally, the research conducted by the project will provide insights into future management and learning in SC. © The Author(s) 2023.},

AI technologies could significantly contribute to overcoming the complexity of project management through process automation, cognitive insight, and engagement. However, the adoption of AI technologies still faces many challenges due to technical, human resource-related, organizational, and legal issues. Our research identified the potential factors that lead to the willingness of people and organizations to adopt AI technologies in project management. This paper proposes a causal model describing multivariate causal relationships between the driving factors and the willingness to adopt AI. The causal model is a set of hypotheses evaluated through a survey and causal analysis using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The analysis focused on six factors influencing the willingness to adopt AI in project management, i.e., performance effectiveness, price, previous experience, feedback, complexity, and complementary technologies. Our research found that the perception of the high effectiveness of AI technologies leading to higher profits and overall the state of the project is the main factor influencing the willingness to adopt AI technologies in project management. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This innovative practice full paper describes the effectiveness of self-hosted large language models (LLMs) in assisting with the automatic grading of CSI assignments. Educators often rely on automated review of student code submissions in larger courses. Despite recent advancements, current systems primarily focus on assessing functionality, with important aspects such as code structure, efficiency, and style often relegated to secondary foci. LLMs provide an increasingly attractive addition to these systems to enhance those overlooked areas. Prior research has shown LLM's capable of assisting students in understanding and resolving programmer error messages, correcting syntax errors, providing enhanced explanations of code segments, or even generating code. The absence of freely available, purpose-designed LLMs for grading and providing feedback on code submissions prevents widespread adoption by educators. Remotely-hosted systems, such as fine-tuned GPT models, have shown promise, yet the associated risks of privacy breaches, ethical considerations, and recurring costs make this approach unfeasible as a universal solution. To mitigate these concerns, self-hosted open-source models are an alternative that can operate on consumer-grade hardware and prevent some privacy and security concerns. While no purpose-built solution yet exists, it is unclear if any existing models are powerful enough to facilitate automated grading. To explore these questions, we present a two-phase analysis, leveraging real grading data from a semester length, introductory CSI course with 124 students and nine programming projects. Nine stable LLM models were selected and repeatedly prompted to grade student submissions using the same context that a human teaching assistant (TA) was given. This paper analyzes 1,172,383 API requests, totaling 33.4 days of active runtime, evaluating model consistency, ability to adhere to specified constraints, and comparison to human-generated grades. The results show various models' inability to consistently grade assignments, albeit with some exceptions. The importance of providing comprehensive context to models was highlighted, as incomplete contexts resulted in worse performance. Other models struggled with longer prompts, delivering less consistent results. Despite disparities between AI-generated and human-assigned grades, the potential for refinement is clear; improved rubrics or selective fine-tuning could enhance model output. Future work will focus on analyzing models' qualitative justifications for grades, refining rubrics, training on domain-specific datasets, and fine-tuning the highest performing models to potentially improve grading accuracy. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper aims at a broad scan of needs for knowledge advancing living labs and broader customer value co-creation in shopping malls. Special attention is given to the meeting and social integration function and metaverse development. Living labs are understood as a methodology of co-creative and open experimentation that is customer-led in a real-life environment. Emerging metaverse development tends to change opportunities and limitations, about which almost nothing is known. The paper uses a qualitative approach in two steps. The first step explores relevant theory on systems, like retail systems, customer-value co-creation (marketing) and capability and personal traits in behavioural change (individuals), while distinguishing between three living lab stages, namely, anticipation, processes on the way, and ex-post evaluation. A few central themes that are becoming increasingly important are the emerging metaverse, if and how traditional malls can continue serving as physical meeting places, and the possibility they will change course towards new combinations of physical and virtual activity. In the second step, a broad array of knowledge-advancing needs is discussed, and this results in a smaller set of knowledge gaps on the basis of urgency, like interests of new ICT stakeholders in shopping malls, impacts from metaverse on site-specificity, and benefits and barriers of disabled persons. The paper also forwards the need for more attention to the ex-post evaluation of co-creation projects, which calls for standard protocols and AI-supported data systems. The paper closes with contributions, management implications, and ideas about future research. © 2023 by the author.},

This paper takes the course of Human Resource Management for medical and health management majors as an example and discusses in some detail the potential and practical effectiveness of generative AI in enhancing the efficiency and quality of teaching in this course. This paper uses the case study method to explore the intelligent generation of knowledge points, personalized learning recommendation system, and intelligent homework correction of generative AI in classroom teaching. In addition, this paper evaluates the teaching effect of generative AI from various aspects, such as students' learning effectiveness, participation, and satisfaction. Through the collection and analysis of relevant data, it is facilitated that generative AI can effectively improve students' learning motivation and achievement and strengthen the implementation of classroom interaction and individual teaching. The study shows that generative AI can not only improve the quality and efficiency of teaching, but also continuously optimize teaching strategies through data-driven approaches, creating more value for both teachers and students. The case study found that students 001 and 003 were more engaged, as evidenced by the relatively high number of logins, forum postings, and project submissions, and accordingly, their satisfaction scores were higher, at 4 and 5, respectively.

	abstract = {In the rapidly advancing fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, creating a robust and high-quality data foundation is a critical requirement for data-driven projects. However, the lack of a standard procedure for ensuring the existence of a sufficient and high-quality data basis often leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and resource waste, resulting in a high risk of project failure. Existing methodologies often presuppose the availability of a data basis, which is a significant challenge, particularly in the manufacturing sector with its diverse and complex data sources. This challenge is further compounded by the interdisciplinary nature of these projects, where domain experts and data scientists with different expertise and vocabularies must collaborate. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces ML-SIPOC, a novel methodology for creating a standardized and high-quality data basis for data-driven projects. ML-SIPOC builds upon the traditional SIPOC analysis from the Six Sigma management system for operational excellence, adapted to meet the unique challenges of data-intensive projects. It provides a structured framework for systematically building a data foundation, facilitating effective communication between domain experts and data scientists. When applied in electronics manufacturing, ML-SIPOC proved efficient in creating a robust data basis, reducing time and cost overheads. This approach minimizes reliance on prior knowledge for data collection, opening up possibilities for broader AI and Big Data applications across various manufacturing sectors. The key innovation of this paper is the introduction of a first-of-its-kind methodology that provides a structured approach to building a data foundation for data-driven decision making in manufacturing. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

Using SDN, network devices can be controlled from a centralized, programmable control plane that is decoupled from their data plane, whereas with NFV, network functions (such as network address translation, firewall, and intrusion detection) can be virtualized instead of being implemented on proprietary hardware. In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques will be key to automating network operations and enhancing customer service. Many of the challenges behind SDN and NFV are currently being investigated in several projects all over the world using AI and ML techniques, such as AI- and software-based networking, autonomic networking, and policy-based network management. Contributions to this Special Issue come from the above areas of research. Following a rigorous review process, four excellent articles were accepted that address and go beyond many of the challenges mentioned above. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation projects have been undertaken in the land transportation and railway industries, including the introduction of various smart construction technologies. With the expansion of policies to increase the share of railway transportation as an environmentally sustainable means of transportation that meets the needs of the carbon-neutral era, 3D digital information is required throughout the entire chain of railway construction, route selection, status analysis, design, construction, and maintenance. The need for scientific and rational decision making is increasing. In this study, based on point cloud data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a handheld mobile device, the landscape infrastructure around a railway was digitally converted, and a railway Landscape Information Model (LIM) process that modeled various types of landscape information was derived. Additionally, through the voxelization of 3D data, information regarding a railway’s surrounding environment, analyzed as a 3D volume concept and a convergence plan with deep-learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) technology, was presented through object recognition using a clustering algorithm. A railway LIM dataset could be created from a total of seven major categories, and massive data processing through AI convergence will be a future possibility through optimization of the point cloud data clustering algorithm. The future of the railway industry requires the establishment of a railway LIM for the integrated management of a railway’s surrounding environment and building information modeling (BIM) of structures such as tunnels. The railway LIM process has potential for use in various fields, such as environmental management and safety improvement for disaster prevention. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) concept combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), a key enabling technology, opens up new opportunities for improved quality management and advanced problem-solving. However, there is a lack of applied research in industrial plants that would allow for the widespread deployment of this framework. Thus, the purpose of this article was to apply AI in an industrial application in order to develop application insights and identify the necessary prerequisites for achieving ZDM. A case study was done at a Swedish manufacturing plant to evaluate the implementation of a defect-detection strategy on products prone to misclassification and on an imbalanced data set with very few defects. A semi-supervised learning approach was used to learn which vibration properties differentiate confirmed defects from approved products. This method enabled the calculation of a defect similarity ratio that was used to predict how similar newly manufactured products are to defective products. This study identified four prerequisites and four insights critical for the development of an AI solution supporting ZDM. The key finding demonstrates how well traditional and innovative quality methods complement one another. The results highlight the importance of starting data science projects quickly to ensure data quality and allow a ZDM detection strategy to build knowledge to allow for the development of more proactive strategies, such as the prediction and prevention of defects. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Mobile apps, used by many people worldwide, have become an essential part of life. Before using a mobile app, users judge the reliability of apps according to their reviews. Therefore, app reviews are essential components of management for companies. Unfortunately, some fake reviewers write negative reviews for competing apps. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-based macro bot programs that generate app reviews have emerged and can create large numbers of reviews with malicious purposes in a short time. One notable AI technology that can generate such reviews is Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2). The reviews generated by GPT-2 use human-like grammar; therefore, it is difficult to detect them with only text mining techniques, which use tools like part-of-speech (POS) tagging and sentiment scores. Thus, probability-based sampling techniques in GPT-2 must be used. In this study, we identified features to detect reviews generated by GPT-2 and determined the optimal feature combination for improving detection performance. To achieve this, based on the analysis results, we built a training dataset to find the best feature combination for detecting the generated reviews. Various machine learning models were then trained and evaluated using this dataset. As a result, the model that used both text mining and probability-based sampling techniques detected generated reviews more effectively than the model that used only text mining techniques. This model achieved a top classification accuracy of 90% and a macro F1 of 0.90. We expect the results of this study to help app developers maintain a more stable mobile app ecosystem.

	abstract = {When using lean waste management in construction project delivery, computational methodologies are currently an innovative technology for the implementation of efficient and effective improvement strategies in the development of Industry 4.0 in Chile. Lean models are able to manage data obtained from construction projects along with the data obtained from the knowledge base of professional experts (expert survey). The waste management of construction projects under the lean philosophy requires cooperative efforts, where the opinion of professional experts is completely paramount to analyze multidisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, new protocols and disruptive procedures based on artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help decision makers prioritize activities, minimize uncertainty, and avoid wasteful actions that add no value to the project and thus can be minimized or completely eliminated. The vagueness of subjective human judgment in the degree of application of lean waste management in project delivery is modeled by a fuzzy logic model that includes additional considerations related to the lean implementation. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis has been implemented in order to verify and validate the previous digital fuzzy model. In this sense, the main aim of this study is to develop new approaches regarding AI systems, using fuzzy sets and multiple linear regression for managing waste in construction project delivery in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile. A theorized application of the models reveals that the sample (100 construction projects) can be classified into three lean waste condition levels: high, medium, or low waste effects. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the Chilean construction industry environment and will open new ways for harnessing AI-based technology in the construction industry to the fullest potential, to achieve better time and cost predictability with a client- and end-user-centered world view. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

While machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing risks in increasingly complex projects, its”black box” nature often obscures decision-making processes. Current explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and G-LIME (Global-LIME), provide valuable insights into feature importance but struggle with capturing the intricate relationship and cascading effects among multiple risk factors. Our proposed frameworks address these limitations by not only elucidating the impact of individual risk factors and interpreting the antecedents but also by revealing their interconnections and cascading effects. Through a comparative analysis, this study demonstrates how ISM-LIME and KG-LIME overcome the shortcomings of traditional XAI methods. ISM-LIME offers a clear hierarchical representation of risk interactions, while KG-LIME provides a detailed network-based view that captures complex interdependencies. This comparison highlights the strengths of each approach in improving risk assessment and decision-making. © 2024 Computers and Industrial Engineering. All rights reserved.},

The targets for such 3GPP studies and standardization are to lower power consumed at user equipment (UE) and reference signal (RS) overhead that are currently needed by frequent beam measurements due to UE rotation and mobility. To meet such targets, in this paper, we investigate AI/ML based algorithms facilitating TD beam prediction suitable for 5G-Advanced beam management (BM), including RS receive power (RSRP) prediction and beam change prediction. The proposed AI/ML algorithms are first evaluated through computer simulations with new UE mobility models based on recent standard evolutions in 3GPP. Then we further present over-the-air test results achieved by such AI/ML algorithms, using based station (BS) and UE compliant with 3GPP standards. Evaluation results show that the proposed schemes can accurately predict future beams and reduce large amount of the power consumed at the UE for BM, which also demonstrate feasibility of AI/ML based BM for 5G-Advanced and future 6G communications.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of automated optical inspection (AOI) edge artificial intelligence (AI) inference system solutions in the digital industry by considering if, and how, they enable manufacturers to reach a satisfactory trade-off between customer needs and production costs. Numerous solutions can address customer and factory needs, from inspection machines to testing boards equipped with cameras installed near the conveyor belt. In all the considered solutions we can implement effective defect detection algorithms, such as the latest You Only Look Once (YOLO) variants based on deep learning (DL), to obtain high key performance indicators (KPIs), i.e., mean average precision, adequate process capability and high throughput yield. Parallel implementations of edge test systems allow us to further improve production yield, while repeated tests performed in sequence can allow us to approach the precision required for zero defect practice. The comparison of available solutions using KPIs, functional requirements (FRs) and non-functional requirements (NFRs) highlights that the advantage of using inspection machines is that they are equipped with user interface and data analysis which helps workers and managers to ensure high quality production process and effective order management. Their weakness is the high cost of purchase and energy consumption, whereas solutions that use computing boards for defect testing at the edge are featured by lower costs. A demonstrator to evaluate the effectiveness of edge AI solutions based on the test boards available on the market and those developed by the EdgeAI project is outlined. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The introduction of the Factory of the Future has revolutionised the manufacturing sector through the integration of various technologies such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud computing and cyber-physical control systems (CPCS). These advances have created the need to develop novel communication systems to support new industrial requirements. Therefore, the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) has become one of the most relevant alternatives in this field. However, the current regulations in Europe and the spectrum reserved for private 5G may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of some of the industrial applications for which it was conceived. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the private 5G network to identify the performance thresholds according to the requirements set by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for the selected industrial scenarios. This work proposes a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of private 5G infrastructures to meet the industrial requirements studied for different use cases proposed by 3GPP. For this purpose, laboratory tests have been carried out to analyse the performance of a 5G physical network infrastructure and the results were compared with those obtained after modelling different scenarios using Simu5G, a 5G simulator based on the OMNeT++ framework. The conclusions drawn from this work have shown that, although 5G technology is a key enabler for the industrial sector, there are European private spectrum reservation initiatives that do not have sufficient performance to meet the more restrictive requirements for different uses defined by 3GPP, and therefore need to be adapted to drive the adoption of new spectrum reservations for this type of private infrastructure in industry.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We build upon prior studies that suggest artificial intelligence algorithms are an effective approach to obtaining this understanding. Our approach uses behavioral finance and a unique decision-making model. Although the decision-making literature is replete with descriptions and explanations of creditors and investors' perceptions and judgment, it does not provide an algorithmic model that incorporates a more flexible approach to how creditors subjectively valuate risky projects. Specifically, a model is presented where 33 corporate bankers realized ex ante that they were unable to accurately model the underlying uncertainty that characterizes a company's need for a loan. The results indicate that bankers' risk assessments result in different evaluations of financial information regarding loans. This approach depicts an integrative algorithmic modelling process, whereby limits in the amount of historical conditional information prohibit the use of more complex econometric techniques. © 2023 The Authors},

However, they highlighted several barriers to AI adoption, such as data quality and management issues, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and trust in AI. To overcome these barriers and ensure successful AI implementation, companies should involve all stakeholders, focus on data quality and management, and ensure the AI solution integrates with existing processes and workflows. In addition, companies should also avoid common mistakes when implementing AI, such as neglecting the importance of explainability and transparency in AI decision-making, underestimating the importance of involving all stakeholders, and rushing into large-scale implementation without conducting small-scale pilot projects. By following the recommendations and avoiding common mistakes, companies can harness the benefits of AI in SCM while minimizing risks and challenges. © 2023},

	abstract = {With the growing adoption of AI, trust and explainability have become critical which has attracted a lot of research attention over the past decade and has led to the development of many popular AI explainability libraries such as AIX360, Alibi, OmniXAI, etc. Despite that, applying explainability techniques in practice often poses challenges such as lack of consistency between explainers, semantically incorrect explanations, or scalability. Furthermore, one of the key modalities that has been less explored, both from the algorithmic and practice point of view, is time-series. Several application domains involve time-series including Industry 4.0, asset monitoring, supply chain or finance to name a few. The AIX360 library (https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360) has been incubated by the Linux Foundation AI & Data open-source projects and it has gained significant popularity: its public GitHub repository has over 1.3K stars and has been broadly adopted in the academic and applied settings. Motivated by industrial applications, large scale client projects and deployments in software products in the areas of IoT, asset management or supply chain, the AIX360 library has been recently expanded significantly to address the above challenges. AIX360 now includes new techniques including support for time-series modality introducing time series based explainers such as TS-LIME, TS Saliency explainer, TS-ICE and TS-SHAP. It also introduces improvements in generating model agnostic, consistent, diverse, and scalable explanations, and new algorithms for tabular data. In this hands-on tutorial, we provide an overview of the library with the focus on the latest additions, time series explainers and use cases such as forecasting, time series anomaly detection or classification, and hands-on demonstrations based on industrial use-cases selected to demonstrate practical challenges and how they are addressed. The audience will be able to evaluate different types of explanations with a focus on practical aspects motivated by real deployments.  © 2023 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Log-based anomaly detection is important for improving the reliability and availability of software systems, especially those evolving using DevOps, owing to the huge number of logs generated during continuous practices. However, DevOps practitioners typically inspect and interpret the generated data and logs manually on specific occasions as part of the troubleshooting process. This process of manual inspection is time consuming and challenging because these data and logs have grown to an unmanageable size owing to the increasing size and complexity of the systems. In this research paper, we introduce the DevOps Anomaly Detection Framework (DADF). DADF is composed of two components that rely on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the data and logs generated during DevOps practices to automatically detect anomalies. The first component is Anomaly Detection Before Production (ADBP), which intends to detect anomalies in the prospective release before its operation in the production environment by adopting the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) technique on the data collected during implementation, building, testing, and deployment. The second component is Anomaly Detection After Staging (ADAS), which intends to detect anomalies after the operation of the released system by adopting the Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) technique on the data collected during monitoring from the system log, application log, and performance metrics (CPU and memory). We experimentally evaluated ADBP and ADAS in two different real-world industrial projects. The experimental results demonstrated that the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the ADBP component were 96%, 87.5%, 100%, and 93.3%, respectively, and the normalized Root Mean Squared Error (nRMSE) of the ADAS component was 2–19%. Hence, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of DADF in helping DevOps practitioners and researchers automatically detect anomalies throughout the lifecycle of DevOps by monitoring all DevOps’ practices. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Numerous oyster restoration projects have been launched with a crucial element involving precise assessment of oyster population sizes within specific reef areas. However, the current methods of tracking oyster populations are approximate and lack precision. To address this research gap, the authors developed an AI-empowered project for oyster detection. Specifically, they created a dataset of wild oysters, utilized Roboflow for image annotation, and employed image augmentation techniques to augment the training data. Then, they fine-tuned a YOLOv8 computer vision object detection model using their dataset. The results demonstrated a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.2 percent and an accuracy of 87.7 percent for oyster detection. This approach improved upon previous attempts to detect wild oysters, offering a more effective solution for population assessment, which is a fundamental step toward sustainable oyster restoration project management. © 2023 IGI Global.

	abstract = {Context: The knowledge domain of software engineering (SE) gradually expands due to fast emerging technologies and complex organisational processes. The software industry represents a special focus of interest from a Knowledge Management (KM) perspective, as it is characterized by high employee turnover, a high level of outsourced projects, and an accelerated pace of technology innovations. Knowledge management can substantially influence SE knowledge's life cycle, contributing to better structuring of organisational processes of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, and knowledge sharing. Reflecting on the trends for SE automation with artificial intelligence tools, KM approaches can enable companies and professionals to reconsider the future of SE work. Purpose: The present research aims to identify and investigate how implementing knowledge management principles and processes within the software engineering domain can facilitate the future transformation of software-related jobs. Based on a conceptual model, built upon the literature review, the paper analyses the quantitative data, collected from 91 software experts. Evaluating the impact of both organizational and domain types of SE knowledge, the discussion evaluates the unique value-adding SE processes along with models of how to explore AI applications to automate the SE domain. Results: The outcomes of the analysis identify the models of structuring knowledge management processes in SE both within the technological domain and organisational layers. The discussion section establishes suitable KM methods and approaches for supporting SE job transformation. It identifies the main knowledge management integration practices, demonstrating how combining KM with AI-based innovations may change the SE knowledge flow, improving substantially SE activities like onboarding new team members, monitoring software documentation, version control, and error tracking. © 2023 Academic Conferences Limited.

	abstract = {The growing shortage of skilled workers and the large number of employees from the 1960s so-called baby boom generation who will be retiring in the next few years are current and growing major challenges for companies in Germany. When people retire, companies can lose a lot of valuable know-how and experience. Experienced professionals enjoy a special status in companies because of their extensive and in-depth knowledge of work processes. Salaries and positions in companies are often linked to knowledge. The fear of losing status or even financial loss by sharing knowledge can be a reason for employees to keep their knowledge to themselves. The use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence in companies can also trigger several fears among employees like fears regarding job loss, new skill requirements or surveillance. An innovative work culture, where knowledge sharing is actively encouraged, required and rewarded, is not successfully implemented everywhere. A particular challenge in the KI_eeper project is to convince experienced employees in the participating organizations of the importance of sharing and preserving knowledge to ensure the company's long-term competitiveness. The aim is to encourage them to provide their knowledge to other employees with the help of an AI assistance system. In addition to the development of an assistance system, an important task of the project is the development of methods promoting knowledge transfer and contributing to the acceptance of the use of the new technology. Information and awareness-raising workshops with managers and employees have been designed and tested in the companies. Employees are involved in the development of the system in a participatory approach. This ensures that the system can be developed in a user- and needs-oriented manner and thus the acceptance of the system's use in future everyday work can be promoted, which is crucial for long-term successful application. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Teamwork is a critical component of engineering education, established as both an ABET competency and recognized by engineers in the workforce as one of the essential skills to their work. As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics. Consequently, instructors can be hesitant to share peer evaluation scores and comments with students because students may not be comfortable sharing honest, authentic feedback with their peers. However, withholding this valuable formative feedback to students may come at the expense of their individual professional development, especially in devel-oping teamwork skills. Additionally, these project-based learning (PBL) courses tend to be large, and summarizing formative feedback for individual students based on peer evaluations can be time-consuming and perhaps unrealistic with increasing class sizes. To address this need, we present the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system to create individual performance summaries based on student peer responses. The authors present preliminary work from a pilot study that uses generative AI to produce individual performance summaries using CATME data from a first-year engineering course at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We share a sample output performance summary using a generative AI tool, GPT-4 specifically. Our initial findings indicate AI tools, such as GPT-4, can serve as a solution to provide more confidentiality in peer comments by effectively summarizing peer comments and producing individual performance feedback reviews. This study provides promising initial findings and recommendations on how AI can be leveraged to automate a student feedback process for instructors, allowing students to receive individual performance feedback while also providing an additional layer of confidentiality to support team dynamics and not compromise honest individual assessments. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a pressing global issue primarily driven by excessive energy consumption, with the building sector being a major contributor. In response to this challenge, Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs) have emerged as a promising solution. These buildings are designed to generate as much energy as they consume by leveraging energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources. However, achieving the NZEB goal relies on accurately predicting a building's future energy usage. This precision is crucial for efficiently managing energy production, consumption, storage, and distribution within NZEBs. The current Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions face significant shortcomings that extend beyond mere performance issues. These include critical aspects such as the lack of transparency in gathered data and predicted results, oversight in identifying model drift (especially in fast-paced sectors like energy), and the use of disparate tools in the model development process. This paper addresses these issues when developing AI solutions for NZEB projects by introducing ExplainerX, an integrated and explainable framework that streamlines all stages of building transparent and high-performance prediction models. ExplainerX ensures transparency in both data and results, accounts for data changes in dynamic settings, and promotes effective energy management in buildings. It leverages different components of the CRISP-DM methodology, providing explanations for each pipeline and tracing every decision made by data scientists and decision-makers. The framework is illustrated through a case study utilizing real datasets from the EU Improvement Project. ExplainerX source code is available on our GitHub repository.  © 2023 IEEE.},

These threads typically contain an issue description, comments discussing possible solutions, and often culminate in a pull request where the proposed changes are elaborated. Even though they are crucial, understanding issue threads can be a lot of work because they are often long and complex, particularly in big projects. This paper, therefore, aims to automate the process of issue thread summarization using advanced AI models, specifically the GPT-3.5-Turbo, reducing the time spent and improving the efficiency of the interpretation process. Our approach taps into the potential of the zero-shot learning methodology, enabling the model to produce context-specific summaries without reliance on prior examples. Additionally, we have developed an algorithm that determines the most effective length for these summaries, which enhances their clarity and relevance. The performance of the model is assessed using automated metrics, including ROUGE and BART scores, for extractive and abstractive summary evaluation respectively. Further, we may like to add that summaries of around 30% to 40% of the total size of the issue thread appears to be sufficient, though it varies slightly from case to case. The model's successful generation of brief, clear, and pertinent summaries not only boosts team communication and project management but also lays the groundwork for its future integration into a comprehensive tool for simplified exploration and comprehension of complex software repositories. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The SmartCHANGE project, a Horizon-Europe Research & Innovation project that has been ongoing since May 2023 and is scheduled to conclude in April 2027, aims to develop AI-driven decision-support tools to identify and reduce the long-term risk of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in children and youth. NCDs have become a significant public health burden in developed countries, with common risk factors including obesity, low physical fitness, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for establishing healthy habits, and early intervention can prevent or delay the onset of NCDs later in life. However, current tools for identifying high-risk individuals mainly focus on adults, leading to missed opportunities for early detection. The SmartCHANGE project aims to address this gap by creating trustworthy AI tools that accurately assess risk factors in children and youth and promote optimised strategies for risk reduction. The paper outlines the plan for the project from the project's proposed methodologies, including dataset utilisation, data cleaning, risk prediction models (basic and complex), and the implementation of federated learning. Additionally, it discusses user experience aspects such as participatory design, suggested applications, and the evaluation of project outcomes.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly contribute to decentralizing and digitalizing the energy sector and environmental sustainability. Integrating AI-driven smart energy services (SES), such as energy production forecasting, building energy management, and predictive maintenance, remain in an early phase for plant providers or energy utilities. However, the knowledge regarding key factors determining the design of AI-driven SES is limited in the literature. Therefore, we derive critical success factors (CSFs) for the design of AI-driven SES in a design science research (DSR) approach in connection with the design thinking process. We identified ten CSFs and 31 CSF categories by iteratively combining the knowledge of interviewed AI business experts, scientific literature, and results of AI programming projects with students. Based on this, we developed a further research agenda containing six research demands and direct further research questions. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

To efficiently manage the manpower of an organization, the founders, CEO, and managers need to determine which employees must be promoted. Promotion boosts employee morale, improves the resource allocation of the organization, and helps identify talent. In this project, we have explored various machine learning algorithms to predict the promotion of an employee based on multiple employee-related factors such as education, training, rating and length of service. The analysis focuses on creating a predictive model after thorough feature analysis and preprocessing of the training data. We have trained multiple classification models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Evaluation metrics, namely, precision, recall, and Fl-score, were used to evaluate the performance of each model, and the XGBoost classifier outperformed the other algorithms. In addition, we have implemented explainable artificial intelligence methods such as local interpretable model agnostic explanations. Additive explanations to derive the reason behind the predictions made by artificial intelligence. The current work managed to predict with an accuracy of 95% and detect the features that have an impact on employee promotion. © 2023 IEEE.},

In the context of the research project AlGeWert at the University of Wuppertal, this work focuses on a concept for the identification of differentiation criteria between the various legal bases of product liability applicable in Germany. These are intended to serve as a starting point for training AI algorithms to support the evaluation of complaint texts and increase employees' confidence in action. For this purpose, the different legal bases applicable in Germany with regard to product liability are presented and differentiated from each other. A decision-making structure is then introduced that can be deployed to automatically examine customer complaint texts with regard to the various liability options. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The last decade indicates a drastic upswing in the adoption of organizational artificial intelligence (AI). Companies increasingly seize the transformative potential AI entails to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of various business functions. However, studies show that over 85% of all AI projects in organizations fail to be implemented. Therefore, this study investigates the most common AI project management challenges that prevent organizations from successfully deploying AI initiatives. It further explores how the human-centered innovation method design thinking (DT) can address these challenges. To do so, a multiple-case study with a single-unit of analysis was conducted, whereby twenty representatives from ten companies and startups were interviewed. Findings show that in practice, the six most frequently occurring AI project management challenges are: the lack of education around the topic and the resulting distrust in such technology; the missing user-centricity that leads to the development of undesired solutions; the fact that pre-defined solutions hinder project teams from adequately analyzing the business problem first; the insufficient cross-department collaboration and communication; and the absence of high-quality data. Moreover, it was found, that the four overarching DT elements which help organizations tackle these problems are the Needfinding phase, where relevant stakeholders are interviewed and questioned about their pain-points, wishes, and needs at the beginning of the process; the early Prototype Testing where end users can experience the prototypes themselves; the DT Mindset, which entails human-centered thinking, collaboration, integrity, diversity, and empathy, amongst others; and DT as a Process Structure along which AI-driven projects can be developed. Based on insights from this empirical research, suggestions are made which organizations can follow to directly address AI project management challenges and, thereby, increase their rate of successfully deployed AI projects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the global tourism industry has faced unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Taiwan, like many other countries, experienced a significant decrease in inbound tourism. However, an innovative project called Taiwan Outdoor emerged, aiming to leverage AI technology and its AI-enabled chatbot to support inbound tourism by providing enhanced services to foreign expatriates stranded in Taiwan. This essay explores the Parkbus service, the Taiwan Outdoor project, and the role of AI-enabled chatbots in promoting Taiwan's outdoor landscapes and tour packages to attract inbound tourists. Parkbus was introduced as a service to cater to the needs of foreign expatriates stranded in Taiwan during the pandemic. Recognizing the desire for peaceful wellness experiences, Parkbus facilitated convenient transportation to Taiwan’s National Parks, allowing customers to engage in hiking and immerse themselves in the serene natural surroundings. By offering minimum services to ensure freedom and flexibility, Parkbus successfully met the demands of its customers. After three years of compiling customer feedback, the Parkbus team identified the specific needs expressed in these comments. This feedback became the foundation for the Taiwan Outdoor project, a trailblazing initiative that utilizes AI technology to enable more comprehensive services and promote Taiwan’s outdoor landscapes and tour packages to attract inbound tourists. The government of Taiwan recognized the potential of this project and awarded it funding to support its execution. At the heart of the Taiwan Outdoor project is an AI-enabled chatbot. This intelligent virtual assistant utilizes AI technology to provide personalized recommendations, information, and support to inbound tourists interested in exploring Taiwan’s outdoor attractions. Through natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, the chatbot analyzes user inquiries and preferences, enabling it to deliver tailored suggestions and assist with trip planning. By leveraging AI, the chatbot can provide real-time updates on weather conditions, trail information, transportation options, and even offer localized recommendations for dining and accommodations. The AI-enabled chatbot plays a vital role in promoting Taiwan’s outdoor landscapes and tour packages to inbound tourists. By harnessing the power of AI, the chatbot acts as a reliable and accessible tour guide, answering queries, providing recommendations, and offering a seamless user experience. It assists potential tourists in understanding the diverse natural wonders of Taiwan, highlights popular hiking trails, suggests off-the-beaten-path destinations, and showcases the unique cultural experiences available. The chatbot’s ability to understand multiple languages further enhances its effectiveness in engaging with a global audience. The Taiwan Outdoor project, with its AI-enabled chatbot, has revolutionized the way inbound tourists discover and experience Taiwan’s outdoor landscapes. By combining the convenience of the Parkbus service with the intelligence of AI technology, this innovative initiative effectively promotes Taiwan as a desirable destination for nature enthusiasts worldwide. As the project continues to evolve, the chatbot’s capabilities and knowledge base will expand, ensuring an increasingly personalized and immersive experience for inbound tourists. Taiwan’s commitment to leveraging AI to enhance tourism highlights its forward-thinking approach and positions it as a leader in leveraging technology to create memorable visitor experiences. © 2023 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

More subtle and impactful for practitioners is the change in perspective and approach-from a project-driven lifecycle to a product-driven lifecycle of software. Academic programs have kept up with the former set of changes as evidenced in curricular aspects or components such as DevOps, Mobile Application Development, Cloud-Native Application Development, Data Engineering, Big Data Systems, Software Engineering for AI, etc. But there is a distinct lack of representation of the product perspective or approach and the emerging role of Product Management in typical University-level Software Engineering programs and curricula. We propose to address this gap by identifying-and then incorporating into a curriculum-the following:(i)requirements and features of a Software Product Life Cycle,(ii)practices of a product-driven approach to Software Engineering, and(iii)competencies of a Software Product Manager.We show how these aspects can be addressed by a graduate level Software Engineering program with an optional specialization in Software Product Management targeted at practicing Software Engineers.

The exploratory factor analysis was employed based on the extensive survey on AI in Slovenian companies and the multi-criteria measurement with an emphasis on value functions and pairwise comparisons in the analytic hierarchy process. The synthesis and performance sensitivity analysis results show that in the service sector, concerning all criteria, PM is with the level 0.276 best supported with AI in services of professional, scientific, and technical activities, which also stand out concerning the first-level goals in using AI solutions in a project with the value 0.284, and in successful project implementation using AI with the value 0.301. Although the lowest level of AI support to PM, which is 0.220, is in services of wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, these services excel in adopting AI technologies in a project with a value of 0.277. Services of financial and insurance activities, with the level 0.257 second-ranked concerning all criteria, have the highest value of 0.269 concerning the first-level goal of improving the work of project leaders using AI. The paper, therefore, contributes to the comparison of AI support to PM in service sector activities. The results can help AI development policymakers determine which activities need to be supported and which should be set as an example. The presented methodological frame can serve to perform measurements and benchmarking in various research fields.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper delves into the nascent paradigm of Explainable AI (XAI) and its pivotal role in enhancing the acceptability of growing AI systems that are shaping the Digital Management 5.0 era. XAI holds significant promise, promoting compliance with legal and ethical standards and offering transparent decision-making tools. The imperative of interpretable AI systems to counter the black box effect and adhere to data protection laws like GDPR is highlighted. This paper aims to achieve a dual objective. Firstly, it provides an in-depth understanding of the emerging XAI paradigm, helping practitioners and academics project their future research trajectories. Secondly, it proposes a new taxonomy of XAI models with potential applications that could facilitate AI acceptability. Although the academic literature reflects a crucial lack of exploration into the full potential of XAI, existing models remain mainly theoretical and lack practical applications. By bridging the gap between abstract models and the pragmatic implementation of XAI in management, this paper breaks new ground by launching the scientific foundations of XAI in the upcoming era of Digital Management 5.0.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Public policy development is becoming more and more challenging for public administrations and the recent events (first of all the Covid-19 Outbreak) demonstrated how an evidence-based approach is crucial for managing critical situations with short responses, fast adaptation, and citizens' support. The ultimate vision of data-driven policy making entails the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a means of increasing the efficiency of the policy development and management process (i.e. going beyond development to adaptation and optimization) and boosting a more responsive, adaptive, intelligent, and citizen-centric governance. The cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM, is the most widely-used open standard process model that describes common approaches used by AI experts. The paper presents how the H2020 project AI4PublicPolicy leverages this model to promote a new holistic, integrated, and 'AI by design' approach for public policy making, providing the Virtualized Policy Management Environment (VPME) and the blueprints for organizational transformation. Moreover, the paper presents a practical use and validation of this approach in a real-life public policy making case.  © 2023 IEEE.},

AENEA is specifically suited for direct stakeholder engagement in research and innovation development projects that demand empowered stakeholder interactions for the development of information technology innovations to deliver their anticipated added value. Unlike traditional user engagement methods, AENEA focuses on fluid, iterative collaboration and continuous feedback collection, directly using stakeholder's recommendations in the Agile software development process. Through five (5) iterative steps, AENEA clarifies, refines and synchronises stakeholder needs, fostering an open, and adaptable, collaboration framework for shared value generation. AENEA is being implemented in the EU-funded OneAquaHealth project which showcases the importance of urban aquatic ecosystems for the human mental and physical health while also providing a novel AI-based environmental surveillance system to monitor and protect these places. © 2023 IEEE.},

These tools enable stakeholders including government officials, private sector partners, and citizens to identify and prioritize requirements, manage changes, and make sure that the product is as per their expectations. In the context of smart cities, these tools must be able to capture the requirements for a wide range of systems, including transport, energy sector, citizens safety, and environment maintenance. Overall, effective requirements gathering and management tools are critical to the success of smart cities, enabling them to be more efficient, sustainable and responsive. With the advent of new technologies, there is a growing need for advanced tools to support the RE process for smart cities. This paper investigates different artificial in-telligence (AI) based requirements gathering and management tools. Amongst those techniques dependent on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) in recommendation systems for requirements gathering and ReQtest, ReqSuite, Jama Connect, Visure, Xabrio, and IBM DOORS as management tools have been proposed. Their summarized performance revealed different scores across parameters highlighting their impact as effective tools for smart city paradigm. The study concludes that AI-based techniques and tools can be employed in smart cities, with selection based on project requirements and constraints.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Our design is based on a minimalistic approach while at the same time allowing access to hybrid computational resources offered through the owner's computer, HPC computing centers, cloud resources, and distributed systems in general. Access to this framework includes a GUI for monitoring and managing the workflow, a REST service, a command line interface, as well as a Python interface. It uses a template-based batch management system that, through configuration files, easily allows for the generation of reproducible experiments while creating permutations over selected experiment parameters as typical in deep learning applications. The resulting framework was developed for analytics workflows targeting MLCommons benchmarks of AI applications on hybrid computing resources, as well as an educational tool for teaching scientists and students sophisticated concepts to execute computations on resources ranging from a single computer to many thousands of computers as part of on-premise and cloud infrastructure. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool while creating FAIR principle-based application accuracy benchmark generation for the MLCommons Science Working Group Cloudmask application. The code is available as an open-source project in GitHub and is based on an easy-to-enhance framework called Cloudmesh. It can be applied to other applications easily.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Our goal is to create visualizations as automatically as possible, with which such people can neverthe-less understand the software or parts of the software and get a feel for the structure of the software and how its methods work. Especially for newcomers to software projects, for management or even for students and pupils, it can be helpful to get a non-technical insight into the software. We use the concept of visualizing information as comics to present aspects of the software as strikingly as possible, as comics are an effective way to present complex systems and interrelationships for certain target groups. For this purpose, we present a method to generate comics from source code. Our semi-automated process is based on generating a prompt for an LLM from source code, which in turn generates a prompt for a comic image generation using the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. We show that generative AI methods can be used to rapidly generate human-compatible artistic representations from source code. However, further research is needed to validate the understandability of the results.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Recently, AI-based systems have been used to construct themselves. However, there are no studies to measure the quality of the projects, and the ideal images of the projects need to be defined. This paper aims to find the ideal images of the projects in OSS (Open Source Software). For this, we extract the time-series project metrics from the famous OSS projects to categorize for detecting the patterns of projects' growth. Our approach tries to explain the patterns and to give the decision for the patterns, good or not. The time-series metrics from projects include the number of stargazers, forks, commits, etc. The number of stargazers should increase as time passes, and the number of forks tends to decrease. The stargazer pattern indicates that many developers watch the repository since it was managed well. We conducted the case study to analyze the time series data from 10 repositories in GitHub. As a result, we found that the transitions of the number of issues typically form the sawtooth wave. The sawtooth wave pattern suggests that new issues are reported continuously and inventoried periodically. Therefore, the projects with the patterns indicate they are managing well, and many developers pay attention.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Remote Sensing (RS) have emerged as powerful tools with diverse applications in various fields as well as research domains, including environmental monitoring, disaster risk management, agriculture, and even aquaculture. In the Philippines, harnessing the potential of these technologies has been crucial for sustainable development and scientific-based decision-making. This paper presents an overview of collaborative efforts among academic institutions and government agencies in the Philippines initiated by the Department of Science and Technology's Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) to promote education, capacity building, and technology proliferation through Basic AI and Radar RS Training Series. The initiative stems from recognizing the pressing need to equip professionals, researchers, and students with the knowledge and skills required to harness earth observation data using AI, GIS, and Radar RS effectively. Several State Universities and Colleges, Higher Education Institutes, and Government Agencies across the archipelago have committed their infrastructure and manpower for this initiative. With multidisciplinary collaborations and continuous knowledge-sharing activities, these institutions and agencies are fostering a new generation of skilled professionals who can lead the way in integrating emerging technology into the realm of earth observation, leveraging AI and Radar RS for other research and development domains. With the national development goals in line, policymakers prioritize funding for research and educational initiatives, hence DOST-ASTI with the researchers of the Synthetic Aperture Radar and Automatic Identification System for Innovative Terrestrial Monitoring and Maritime Surveillance (SARwAIS) Project is able to expand its reach, covering the major islands in the country. Additionally, academic and governmental collaboration enables the development of joint research projects that address agency and institution-specific challenges, fostering technology transfer and knowledge dissemination. This paper highlights success stories and challenges faced during the implementation of these capacity-building initiatives, shedding light on strategies to enhance their impact and effectiveness in a tailored manner. Evaluation metrics are employed to assess the outcomes and gauge the R&D potential of earth observation data using AI, GIS, and Radar RS. Overall, the collaborative efforts in Basic AI and Radar RS Information, Education, and Communication campaign in the Philippines exemplify a dynamic model for other nations seeking to harness these transformative technologies in academic and national government levels. Through continuous refinement and inclusive engagement with communities, DOST-ASTI remains to be the country's hub for partnerships and collaborations using R&D in the field of space science and technology and other emerging technologies. © 2023 ACRS.

In this way the experience within the university campus will be more enjoyable for students, faculty or staff that can be included as a user of the platform. Allowing the efficiency and effectiveness to ask questions and receive correct answers at the time. For the training, 50 articles indexed in scopus were used, which allowed for effective communication between the interpreter and the user, but with some limitations. The WIT.AI interpreter was able to demonstrate the relevance of some research topics that students can follow as a guide. The development of a web site that allows automation of manual tasks that were previously performed by university staff, such as teachers or advisors, with a platform that serves as a virtual assistant between the system and the end user, with a complex information management, having control at all times of access to this information, was achieved. By designing a voice-operated system strategically located throughout the university's facilities, students are guaranteed to be able to ask questions and receive answers in real time. This facilitates interaction between students and the application, improving the response time. Future work is needed to augment and automate more training items.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the modern era of Industry 4.0, personalization and offerings play a major role in the commercial world. There is a challenge to implement personalized offering to customers in hotels due to demographic and behavioral issues for which our invention has brought out with an innovative approach “Personalization & Fluidic Offerings Platform” (PFOP) described in this paper. PFOP has the following three segments which help to provide packages for hotel rooms along with ancillary services by means of mass personalization and fluidic bundling at the time of booking. (1) Data models will be developed using a bucket of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the customer preferences from the historic hotel booking data and transactional data. (2) Based on the customers’ room type preferences, we bundle the predicted ancillary services along with room type as combo packages by means of AI Recommender System (AIRS) which prioritizes a list of preferred combos for customers. The system will project combos with preferred hotels along with top three statistical scores of bundles obtained from AIRS. (3) Computing fluidic and semi-fluidic offers from a deterministic offer or market price given by a hotel management, and we are optimizing the cost of bundles. Price mechanism—a complex problem: How the customers will prefer hotels while booking their rooms and services at the most appropriate pricing, which helps the hotels as well as their customers to understand the core relationship among the bundles. Hence, the proposed PFOP drawing the customers’ attention with the above features improves the growth of hospitality. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

To enhance people' quality of life and to advance sustainability and effective resource management, they make use of digital technologies. Smart cities aim to improve public services, transport systems, energy efficiency, public safety, among other advantages, through the integration of various technologies, including information artificial intelligence (AI), communication technologies (ICT), and the Internet of things (IoT). The automation of numerous areas, including the smart home, smart environment,, smart economy, smart mobility, and intelligent government, is the focus of these cities. As a result, multi-agent-driven smart cities have drawn a lot of interest from the academic community for their ability to solve complex challenges across a variety of disciplines by allocating responsibilities among numerous agents and enabling them to work together successfully. Although the project of a 'smart city' is a progressive approach to present-day urban settings, there is a growing need to investigate other types of housing, as there may be room to expand the scheme of a 'smart city' to other types of housing Urban. IoTs were created especially to make the Smart municipal idea a reality. This concept aims to use state-of-the-art communication technology to offer inhabitants and municipal administration value-added services. Hence a review of smart city projects is provided, together with analysis of their primary concepts.

	abstract = {This project proposes a groundbreaking approach to revolutionize the traditional educational framework by integrating multimodal deep learning and gamification to foster hyper-personalized learning experiences. Envisioning a classroom where education resonates with individual cognitive rhythms and passions, the system employs advanced algorithms to analyze text, voice, and facial expressions, thereby adapting content delivery to cater to diverse learning styles and needs. Concurrently, gamified elements such as points, badges, and personalized challenges enhance motivation, engagement, and retention. The teacher's role transforms from a primary knowledge source to a skilled guide and facilitator, leveraging AI-driven insights to curate tailored learning experiences and interventions. This paradigm shift in pedagogy aims to create an inclusive, empowering, and adaptive learning environment where every student embarks on a personalized educational odyssey, celebrating their unique potential and fostering lifelong learning. © 2023 IEEE.},

We conducted a pilot study of direct users of AI enabled technologies to investigate the challenges and opportunities of successful implementations of human-machine systems. Our study found that organisations have realised positive benefits from AI projects through high levels of communication, stakeholder consultation, problem management, ethics, and transparency. Significant work is required in managing staff motivation and empowerment, trust in AI technologies, and managing novel cyberthreat issues. Shortcomings in AI technology development in the areas of accuracy, reliability, trust, and human-machine interaction appear to be significant barriers to adoption and performance, as is the integrative and synchronous development of both human and technical systems. Performance outcomes may be equally dependent on how well organisation can strategically use AI to adapt, integrate and renew itself in a constantly shifting technological landscape. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

Accordingly, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are used in this approach to reduce such uncertainty in RCF. More explicitly, the outside view adopts the performance of past similar projects to predict that of the future project. As widely acknowledged in the literature, the similarity between the selected reference and the new project is of paramount importance. Despite this, the previous literature did not show how to measure the extent of the similarity to the new project. This study was conducted to fill this important gap by proposing a measure of similarity. The proposed measure can be used to quantify how previous projects were distributed. In the proposed method, eight real-life construction projects were analyzed using AI tools to select a highly comparable reference to the project.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The proposed method leverages e.g. YOLOv8's real-time capabilities and high accuracy to identify and track construction elements within site images and videos. A dataset was created, consisting of various building elements and annotated with relevant objects for training and validation. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using standard metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods. The integration of Computer Vision into CPM provides stakeholders with reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means to monitor project progress, facilitating timely decision-making and ultimately contributing to the successful completion of construction projects. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {At present, spacecraft has the characteristics of complex product composition, technical difficulty, manufacturing process and project management. To meet the needs of improving the quality, efficiency and benefit of spacecraft complex structure products, the construction and improvement of a new generation of scientific research and production information system will be carried out. In this paper, an AI (artificial intelligence) algorithm-based digital integrated platform for automated manufacturing of spacecraft complex structures is established, and various computing and storage resources are optimized, reorganized and scheduled by virtual machines to improve resource utilization. By simulating the assembly sequence, it can be verified whether the operating space is spacious enough, whether the tools used meet the requirements, whether the fixture structure is reliable, and whether there is interference with the product. A quality diagnosis model for the automated manufacturing process of spacecraft complex structures based on the combination of rough set theory and BPNN (BP neural network) in information processing has been established. The diagnosis results of an example show that the BPNN method can greatly improve the diagnosis efficiency and reduce the diagnosis cost, which can provide an effective reference for solving the quality diagnosis in modern spacecraft engineering. It can gradually realize the digital design, simulation, manufacturing, maintenance/repair of spacecraft, and completely digitize the whole life cycle from product design, process design, parts manufacturing, assembly and assembly, maintenance and repair.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research to practice full paper explores a new educational framework for AI-informed leadership and evaluates its curriculum and pedagogical approach through a novel, tailored, research instrument. Artificial Intelligence continues to rapidly transform many aspects of markets, solutions, and organizational culture across companies, agencies, and institutions in the public and private sectors. Within complex organizations, AI tools, technologies, and applications inform how leaders engage in strategy-making, management, operations, human resources, and professional education. Non-technical managers and executives are increasingly expected to lead teams to implement responsible AI solutions with the promise to improve efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, profitability, and more. AI is rapidly transforming organizational culture, requiring non-technical leaders to develop AI literacy and essential skills to lead teams in implementing responsible AI solutions. In the face of AI-driven change, business leaders need to be AI literate and develop their own essential skills, knowledge, procedures, and perspectives to successfully set vision and strategy to lead teams that can leverage AI to achieve inward-facing and outward-facing business goals. This presents challenges and opportunities to develop new pedagogical approaches and measures to prepare and assess business leaders' AI leadership skills - including understanding human-AI systems in the workplace and their responsible development and ethical use. There are also cultural and organizational behavior challenges in successfully adopting these new capabilities into a global and diverse human-AI workforce at scale. To advance these, we present an innovative hands-on AI leadership curriculum, where participants learn by making and team problem-solving, for United States Air Force (USAF) leaders to learn about AI and its responsible use in human-robot teaming with autonomous robots. We contribute new measures to assess their attitudinal shifts in AI leadership with respect to culture, mindsets, and ethics. We present a pilot study to evaluate our curriculum design and pedagogical approach to foster positive shifts in our AI leadership measures. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a globally escalating health issue, with its complications significantly reducing life expectancy and imposing considerable economic and social burdens. Particularly in Chile, prevalence soars to 25–30% among individuals aged 65 and over from mid to low socioeconomic backgrounds. However, only 34% of T2DM patients achieve a target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of less than 7%. Our proposed project aims to address this challenge by developing and validating an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-integrated, cloud-based mobile health (mHealth) platform designed to enhance T2DM management. This platform facilitates lifestyle modifications and medication adherence, reducing treatment burden, while fostering patient education and self-management. It leverages biometric sensors in smartphones and wearable devices to generate metabolic control indicators to improve glycemic control beyond HbA1c and utilizes AI image processing techniques for early detection of feet ulcers. The mHealth concept, bolstered by increasing mobile connectivity, integrates patients and health providers into digital platforms, thereby creating a collaborative care model. Evidence has shown that multidimensional strategies have superior outcomes to unidimensional approaches, emphasizing the importance of incorporating various determinants into T2DM management. This novel AI-integrated cloud-based mHealth platform has the potential to revolutionize T2DM care by providing comprehensive, personalized, and efficient management solutions that not only address medical needs but also empower patients. By integrating cutting-edge AI and mHealth technology, our project is set to transform the landscape of T2DM management and improve the quality of life for millions of patients. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to automate these low value-added services. Many other low-cost locations are emerging as competitors for the Indian IT industry. New technologies also offer scope for high-value services. This study proposes a theoretical model based on the resource-based view to understand the phenomenon of moving up the value chain in IT services. Data collected from 230 employees of Indian IT service organisations were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results show that the relationship management capability and the project management capability of the IT service organisation improve the quality of the service provided, which in turn enables the organisation to move up the value chain of IT services.

	abstract = {Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented automation opportunities in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. However, despite the enthusiasm regarding the use of AI, 85% of current big data projects fail. One of the main reasons for AI project failures in the AEC industry is the disconnect between those who plan or decide to use AI and those who implement it. AEC practitioners often lack a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI, leading to a failure to distinguish between what AI should solve, what it can solve, and what it will solve, treating these categories as if they are interchangeable. This lack of understanding results in the disconnect between AI planning and implementation because the planning is based on a vision of what AI should solve without considering if it can or will solve it. To address this challenge, this work introduces the LeanAI method. The method has been developed using data from several ongoing longitudinal studies analyzing AI implementations in the AEC industry, which involved 50+ hours of interview data. The LeanAI method delineates what AI should solve, what it can solve, and what it will solve, forcing practitioners to clearly articulate these components early in the planning process itself by involving the relevant stakeholders. By utilizing the method, practitioners can effectively plan AI implementations, thus increasing the likelihood of success and ultimately speeding up the adoption of AI. A case example illustrates the usefulness of the method. © ISARC 2023. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The detection of Pancreatic cancer at the early stages of its development is still extremely difficult. This relatively rare malignant disease is notorious for its great mortality rate and extremely low patient life expectancy. One of the main reasons for this is the delayed diagnosis when the treatment of invasive and non-invasive procedures is ineffective. A lot of factors have been recognized as risky for the development of pancreatic cancer. The earliest possible detection of these factors by the patient could ease disease prevention, as part of the risk factors could be modified or mitigated. Capabilities of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to support and enhance cancer prediction, prevention, and/or patient monitoring and management. The role of primary healthcare providers in disease screening and early detection is well-known. The objective of this study is to analyze the primary healthcare providers' attitudes toward the utilization of ICT and AI in pancreatic cancer prediction, prevention, and early diagnosis. A survey based on a Likert 5-scale has been performed among 57 primary healthcare medical specialists in the context of the iHELP EU-funded project. The outcomes demonstrate that most of the medical specialists support the implementation of the ICT and AI technologies but are not fully confident about their capabilities and are efficient in detecting, extracting, and correlating significant medical data towards the development of reliable risk predictors and the provision of personalized recommendations for prevention and intervention. Finally, the AI tools that are developed in the context of the project are assessed and evaluated towards changing the expressed beliefs.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The delivery of computing services - including storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and more - has started with Cloud Computing (CC) over the Internet, delivered from off-premise datacenters, running infrastructure at scale with a pay as you go service to their end customers. As the Internet of Everything (IoE) continues to evolve, parts of these services are migrating from the centralized locations (Cloud) to more decentralized locations closer to the end-user, e.g. Fog Computing (FC), Edge Computing (EC) and only recently on to the end-user device itself, the Mist Computing (MC). By 2025, Gartner predicts 75% of the data will be processed at the Edge. Applications are characterized by big data and near real-time processes in various areas, such as: energy management, highways, buildings, plant automation, supply chain, visual security, signage, and mobile-EC. Unlike for Cloud systems, reference frameworks and standards for FC and EC are still in an early stage of development or non-existant for MC. As part of the European project BRAINE (a 28-partner consortium), a novel type of Edge MicroDataCenter (EMDC) providing cost-effective, powerful computing resources close to end-users and specifically designed for AI elaborations is being developed with very efficient cooling that nears being completely passive. The present study concentrates on experimental validations of a new highly efficient, passive thermosyphon cooling system (patent pending by October 2023) thermally managing the level and uniformity of temperature for all the electronics in the package (no air cooling at all within the computer chassis). The primary objective is the cooling of 11 nodes (which include CPUs, FPGAs, GPUs and Storage) considering one heat sink evaporator per node. Presently, a first prototype as a simplified EMDC with 4 slots (i.e 4 nodes) has been fabricated and the entire thermosyphon cooling system evaluated. The experimental results are presented. The working fluids used are the new environmentally friendly refrigerants R1233zd(E) and R1234ze(E). It is highlighted that BRAINE's overall aim is to boost the development of the Edge framework and specifically energy-efficient hardware and AI-empowered software systems, capable of processing Big Data at the Edge, performing AI functions, supporting security, data privacy and sovereignty. Then, cooling is one of the most important aspect in this new technological challenge. In fact, our cooling system has no moving parts inside computer (solid-state) and our thermosyphon has an energy efficiency ratio of heat dissipation-to-cooling fan power up to 64-to-1.

	abstract = {One of the most crucial components of workforce planning in Human Resources Management (HRM) is ensuring that employees have the appropriate skills and competencies to accomplish their jobs. The expansion of low-cost and traditional carriers has expanded the traditional passenger-carrying services’ reach, breadth, depth, and frequency. Because of the rising demand for highly skilled specialists in intelligent human systems, airline recruiters are under increasing pressure to discover novel methods to attract and communicate with potential applicants. The research project’s purpose was to incorporate Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) into implementing, training, and managing intelligent human system integration for airline employees worldwide. The research team conducted a theoretical examination of the CBTA framework in the USA and Turkey and identified areas of interest in aviation training. Moreover, it advocated integrating the CBTA framework using Artificial Intelligence (AI) across worldwide aviation networks. During the development of the global CBTA framework, the authors analyzed the controlling elements and trends in the aviation industry to provide a global strategy for managing Human Systems Integration (HSI) change. Marques et al. (2023) proposed that aviation universities should prioritize quality over quantity, provide opportunities for continuing education, and encourage learning beyond the ab initio basic knowledge requirements (e.g., quality performance-based training pilot hours incorporating immersive technologies like Artificial Intelligence-AI or/and Simulated Air Traffic Control Environment-SATCE). Demand is affected by organizational culture, opposition to technological progress, and employment regulations. Purdue’s SATT approach synthesizes the Lean Six Sigma (L6) strategy and the CBTA framework as an alternative to the commonly utilized method in many countries, which improves organizational change management. Turkish airlines’ training case study, implementing Threat Error Management with Purdue SATT CBTA orientation, offers a global approach to cost-practical quality training. The outcomes of this parallel case study project suggest that, in addition to utilizing the suggested Lean Six Sigma Recruitment / CBTA procedure, the aviation industry should reevaluate its organizational culture and implement an integrated CBTA-AI strategy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

If a model is correctly selected, AI can help improve healthcare systems by predicting future occurrences. This study analyzes Machine Learning (ML) techniques, discusses their application in an ICU environment and proposes a methodology to develop ML models to predict mean arterial pressure (MAP) values that can assist healthcare professionals' decision making. The current study starts by doing a brief review of ML methods and identifying interesting models to train. The chosen models are then trained and the one considered to be the most appropriate is chosen to be tested in a controlled environment, in a system that can generate medical data. Data is then cleaned, classified, and fed to the model, to give a prediction related to future MAP values. Finally, the developed system is integrated into the ICU4Covid project, more precisely in the B-Health IoT Box, which allows for deployments of new applications for ICUs. The proposed system's integration into ICU4Covid enables remote medical operations and can improve the quality care of healthcare services in ICU environments.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, edge computing has emerged as a crucial component in the fourth industrial revolution, effectively merging data processing in close proximity to its source. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of data processing but also integrates data acquisition, analysis capabilities, sensing, and communication. Additionally, the Internet of Things (IoT) holds substantial importance within Industry 4.0, serving as a fundamental technology for wireless connectivity, data collection, and real-time monitoring. Simultaneously, while edge computing offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges such as security concerns, data-intensive services, handling incomplete data, and notably, substantial investment and maintenance costs. To address these issues, cloud computing technology emerges as the optimal solution. This article aims to to propose an innovative approach called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) for optimizing production management. The focus of this project is the development of a production line for quality control capable of classifying gears as well as detecting defective ones. The production line collects comprehensive data, which is subsequently transmitted to a server for further processing. The results are then displayed through various interfaces, including an a web dashboard, A desktop interface and an Android app, providing analytics insights. This project leverages the integration of AI and IoT technologies within the AIoT framework to create a fully autonomous environment that significantly enhances overall efficiency. © 2023 IEEE.},

Scrum meeting notes were collected in a dataset to permit Scrum roles and instructors to monitor progress and issues. We identified 9 categories of impediments in this dataset: Android, Coding Skills, Debugging, External Factors, Firebase/Database, Git/GitHub, Teamwork, Time Management, and UI/UX Design. We developed a Large Language Model (LLM) to classify these impediments. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has the potential to support software engineering processes. The novelty of this research is that it attempts to identify impediments faced by students’ Scrum teams with AI and support students and instructors. The relevance of the approach was discussed with subject matter experts (SME) of the industry.

	abstract = {Several recent research works and articles detail the changes in lifestyle and behavioral habits resulting from the widespread adoption of digital technologies. These technologies have also transformed the way individuals and communities engage in various health-related activities and situations. These changes have induced an increase in cardiovascular, metabolic, and oncologic diseases. Diseases are assessed as the main cause of preventable deaths and pose a significant threat to the public health. Medical specialists are utilizing the capabilities of the constantly developing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for predicting, preventing, and monitoring these socially significant diseases. However, studies on patients' perception and acceptance of the digital impact on disease diagnosing, prevention, treatment, and monitoring are relatively fewer in number. Hence, the main objective of this article is to present the results of a survey conducted on patients who are assessed at a high risk of developing pancreatic cancer. These patients provide feedback on the emerging topic of the utilization of ICT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the management of this socially significant disease. A Likert 5-scale questionnaire was developed for this survey that was implemented in the context of the iHELP EU-funded project. The responses collected from 57 patients at risk indicate that their current level of belief in the capabilities of ICT and AI to enhance public health prevention and assurance is moderately to highly positive, as supported by the analysis of their responses. At the same time, one-third of the respondents are not confident in the analytical capabilities of AI to predict disease occurrence and develop reliable advice, guidance, and programs for its prevention and effective monitoring of the patients. The impact of the project on the patients' perception is discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Software project management (SPM), which comprises planning, supervising, and keeping track of software projects, is a sophisticated art. However, the complexity and needs of modern software development projects are usually impossible for existing SPM methodologies to handle. The research paper investigates how business process reengineering (BPR) and the strategic application of artificial intelligence (AI) may enhance the effectiveness, quality, and competitiveness of software development processes. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform project management practices by automating operations, enabling project analytics, and offering intelligent recommendations. This paper proposes a framework for managing agile projects, which are gaining popularity due to their speedy value delivery and minimal risk of project failure. Just a few examples of how AI might be incorporated into project management include automating administrative tasks, providing data-driven risk predictions, simplifying project planning, and producing actionable insights. Software development is one of several businesses that has benefited from the popularity of Scrum and other agile project management methodologies. These methods are founded on a dynamic product backlog that consists of bug fixes and user stories. The specific issues that crop up when applying AI to project management are addressed using a five-step process. Using this method, which incorporates contextual considerations, problem-solution matching, and domainspecific implications, organizations can develop customized AI use cases. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the initial phase of this study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to meticulously select noncollinear critical defects associated with construction quality from a comprehensive dataset comprising inspections conducted on 1,015 construction projects. The identified critical components were subsequently categorized into three distinct aspects: Inspection Records and Occupational Safety and Health (Aspect A), Concrete Quality (Aspect B), and Construction Team Quality Management (Aspect C). Subsequently, in the second stage of the study, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network was meticulously trained, utilizing the 23 input variables corresponding to critical defects that had been identified through the PCA process. The training regimen persisted until convergence was achieved, resulting in a well-trained model capable of transforming input data into a probability value indicative of a project's quality level. The MLP model exhibited a remarkable performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 91.3%. These robust evaluation metrics affirm the model's exceptional proficiency in predicting construction quality. The hybrid machine learning approach proposed in this study has proven to be highly effective in extracting valuable insights from inspection data and identifying defects intricately linked to construction quality. This model, with its capacity to accurately forecast construction quality, holds substantial potential for practical application in the construction industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {When dealing with real business problems at a company, developing an artificial intelligence system no longer only relies on the success of compiling a program. The program should meet the efficacy requirements of the business. In particular, focusing on a machine learning model to reach 100% accuracy will encounter a complex and hardly used end-to-end application; thus, the project does not satisfy a functional minimum viable product (MVP). An intricate project also considers good risk management, facilitating software development performances like user interface design, interpretability, robustness, and development costs. In addition, we found that the presence of literatures apparently discusses a different sense of meaning related to this topic, i.e. the use of artificial intelligence to enhance the performance of software development process. For this reason, this paper tries to make sense the terms of developing an artificial intelligence-based system in software development life cycle and risk factors that could lead to project's success with the spirit of sense-making of Dervin's theory. To this end, compared to other models, our proposed model presents the foundation of AI-SDLC in the waterfall model concerning the risk factors. Experimental evidence supporting our analysis is also discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.},

We present an active learning approach to teaching the fast-changing topic of AI ethics using a debate format. This approach was piloted in an undergraduate MIS course of 30 students. Over a five-week period, student teams were assigned to argue either the opportunities (pro) or dangers (con) viewpoint for five different AI technologies. A post-project survey indicated this format helps students gain a better understanding of the applications, opportunities, and potential misuse of AI. Students found this to be an engaging and fun way to explore the multiple dimensions of AI ethics that also required them to employ critical thinking, collaboration, research, and communication skills. We share our findings about the benefits of co-creating knowledge in the classroom using a debate format to explore an evolving topic. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

However, language models often generate inaccurate or misleading responses, negatively impacting its use. Developing domain-specific bots for specific work situations could enhance accuracy and robustness, enabling more effective use of Generative AI in a work context. To help explore this possibility, we developed a data science process-expert generative AI assistant (bot) and evaluated its efficacy. We observed that the bot significantly improved efficiency, guided the exploration of new concepts within data science project management, and fostered creativity. Moreover, the constant availability of the bot allowed access to expertise whenever needed. Furthermore, responses indicated people viewed the bot as a collaborative tool that enabled communication and comprehension of complex questions. In addition, a Likert-scale analysis showed that the bot has the potential to impact the data science field positively. In summary, this research underscores the value of domain-specific bots and the potential impact on data science project management, as well as in other domains.  © 2023 IEEE.},

This paper designs an intelligent transportation information management system based on AI technology, which is divided into three parts: data source, data management and interface management. The combined model of traffic volume prediction based on AI technology is used to jointly predict the traffic volume of urban roads. The graph data is topological structure data constructed according to the direction of traffic flow at the corresponding road intersection. The research results show that when the traffic flow reaches 20 units, the delay time of vehicles can be reduced by more than 50%, which shows the good control effect of the traffic flow prediction model in this paper. The intelligent traffic information management system based on AI technology designed in this paper realizes multi-angle monitoring of road network traffic state and equipment working state, and the management system can be applied to practical engineering projects. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing has received significant attention in recent years due to its potential to assist manufacturing teams in monitoring projects, identifying defects and potential risks, and improving complex workflows and processes. Traditionally, manufacturing projects have been highly knowledge intensive, involving security-conscious processes, and internal and external actors. As AI solutions become more cost-effective and are deployed as assistive tools to support teams in projects, their deployment in manufacturing can be realized. This paper presents a conceptual framework that introduces how AI can enhance the efficiency of manufacturing projects and be successfully applied to projects. A review of extant literature on AI in manufacturing projects is presented and an empirical investigation with 10 manufacturing project managers and AI subject matter experts from engineering organizations in the UK is given. The proposed framework outlines how AI can be applied to manufacturing projects, encompassing both the necessities of projects for the application of AI, and the necessities of AI for their in manufacturing projects. Finally, managerial implications are provided for manufacturing leaders and project managers. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the need for increased autonomy in spacecraft operations and the role of advanced sensors and computational power in enabling autonomous navigation for space exploration, in-orbit servicing, and space debris management. It highlights the emergence of new-generation spacecraft equipped with improved sensors capable of generating high-quality data at unprecedented rates, alongside enhanced computational capabilities. The study also emphasizes the importance of complying with ECSS standards to ensure the reliability, safety, and performance of AI algorithms employed in space systems, while meeting specific space environment requirements and constraints. The presented research builds upon the previous work conducted by Klepsydra with support from ESA in the field of AI for flight software, particularly the KATESU project. This work involved evaluating OBPMark-ML Deep Neural Network models on Teledyne e2v's LS1046 and the ZedBoard (Xilinx ZYNQ 7000) onboard computers, utilizing the embedded Linux as operating system. The findings demonstrated substantial performance improvements, including increased data processing rates and power savings, compared to standard AI solutions, thereby enabling real AI capabilities in space.To make AI applications viable for institutional missions, the project outlines future research efforts within the KATESU initiative. These include porting the novel inference engine software to space-qualified hardware systems such as the GR740 and GR765 on-board processors, developing an extension to accelerate AI algorithms via the HPDP co-processor, and creating another extension to expedite AI algorithm implementation on CPU + FPGA boards. Additionally, the ongoing support for two operating systems, namely RTEMS5 (ECSS-qualified real-time operating system) for GR740, GR765, and HPDP, and FreeRTOS for the FPGA extension, is discussed. This article provides the current development status pertaining to the target hardware platforms and outlines the planned validation process, along with the designed performance benchmarks utilizing OBMark-ML. © 2023 ESA.},

	abstract = {The visitor management issue is one that faces the modern world, and it may help identify and prevent countless fraud, privacy, and other problems. One of the safest solutions, much more so than CCTV and wake-through-gate techniques, is the visitor management system that uses facial recognition. The major decision that must be made in the project is if the system cost is reasonable given the scope of the project. Domestic and industrial use are two examples of how the size of activities and the security needs vary by location. Currently, visitor management systems are largely utilized by businesses, institutions, and schools, but thanks to remarkable improvements, they may soon be employed at toll booths, airports, and train stations as well. The use of Visitor Management Systems is almost universal among companies with sizable facilities and is always expanding at a steady rate. By automatically recognizing outsiders, a facial recognition visitors’ management system (FRVMS) is recommended to increase home security. Centralized systems allow for better process management and monitoring. Due to the fact that this system does not require any additional devices, development costs are also taken into account. Face recognition makes use of the computer’s built-in web camera. When compared to the family of faces recorded in the monitoring system’s database, the detailed features that have been discovered are compared, and if a member is found, security is terminated; if an outsider is found, an alarm notice is shown to the user. The user then puts on a face mask, which means they set a reminder to take it off so they can see their face. Convolutional neural networks, a deep learning methodology, may be used to develop the framework, test it in live scenarios, and research different facial recognition methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.},

	abstract = {This paper plans to develop an Equitable and Re-sponsible AI framework with enabling techniques and algorithms for the Internet of Energy (IoE), in short, RAI4IoE. The energy sector is going through substantial changes fueled by two key drivers: building a zero-carbon energy sector and the digital transformation of the energy infrastructure. We expect to see the convergence of these two drivers resulting in the IoE, where renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access, privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions, optimization and prioritization services, and automated management of flexible resources. The vision of our project is to ensure equitable participation of the community members and responsible use of their data in IoE so that it could reap the benefits of advances in AI to provide safe.. reliable and sustainable energy services.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Honey bees play an essential role in the food chain, being responsible for one third of the global food supply due to pollination. Thus, preserving the health of beehives is of paramount environmental and economic importance. Unfortunately, at present a decline in bee populations is reported, attributed to factors such as climate change, environmental disasters, use of pesticides, etc. The SmartBeeKeep (https://smartbeekeep.eu/) research project, co-funded by EU and Greek funds, builds on the latest developments in remote sensing and AI technologies to provide a holistic platform (currently at the integration stage) that offers services addressing different needs of beekeepers and associated researchers, facilitating their work and contributing to the study of biodiversity. Specifically, an automated mapping service was implemented that runs periodically in the back-end and uses the freely available multi-temporal and multi spectral Sentinel-2 data to estimate and update information regarding beekeeping flora (including blooming detection), based on state-of-the-art AI models for semantic segmentation. Moreover, a web/mobile mapping app and a mobile (progressive web) app were developed, exploiting modern remote sensing and AI technologies. In particular, the mapping app displays freely available data layers that provide crucial information for beekeepers and enables them to view and edit their own data layers, manually entering information regarding beekeeping flora near their apiaries. On the other hand, the mobile app provides two additional functionalities: a) tools for beehive inspection and management, which allow beekeepers to keep track of honey bee colonies development, applied treatments and/or feeding actions, and b) automated AI-based identification of beekeeping plants from photos captured by the mobile phone. An e-marketplace for beekeeping products as well as additional services towards laboratories performing analyses of beekeeping products as well as the general public are also included. Preliminary results for two variants of the automated mapping procedure based on a new dataset including a beekeeping plant are also presented. The final goal is improve current beekeeping practices, reduce costs, and create a new distribution channel for beekeeping products.  © 2023 SPIE.},

As many international auto players have begun different projects based on blockchain, technology will inevitably have an influence on the Indian car sector in the future. However, rather than following the crowd, using technology must be decided upon rationally and according to business logic. Industry and researchers have postulated, predicted, prototyped, and executed a variety of application cases for this technology. IoT, AI, and big data, combined with blockchain has the ability to change how business is conducted and is applicable to all industries and job functions.

	abstract = {The effect of humanity on the earth becomes more and more apparent. Besides the publicly discussed climate change and overpopulation, also the number of conflicts with wildlife increases. The technological progress of the past years helped to understand these challenges better. Monitoring solutions, known to the public as the Internet of Things (IoT), increase the amount of collected data, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) supports analyzing and gathering a deeper understanding. Most projects in the area of wildlife try to achieve a more sustainable usage of natural resources and a better coexistence with our environment. The mAInZaun project focuses on the conflict between wolves and livestock. It aims to introduce these new technologies into grazing management and foster non-lethally coexistence between livestock and predators. Artificial intelligence (AI) analyzes images and videos of the areas surrounding the pasture. The algorithms detect possible attackers or predators, such as wolves, stray dogs, bobcats, etc. In the second step, these animals are scared away using adaptive technologies. These can be sound, ultrasound, scent, light, etc. These systems are usually operated in remote environments, raising challenges like hardware design, power requirements, and maintenance. This paper will discuss these challenges and how we address them in the mAInZaun project. © 2023 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.},

Because Software Cost Estimation (SCE) is prone to human bias, solutions started being researched with the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This paper will investigate the importance of Software Cost Estimation (SCE). Further, the existing taxonomies and methodologies regarding using neural networks with Software Cost estimation will be compared (COCOMO, GEHO-ANN, OLCE, and -ANN-NEAT). This will be done using evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MMRE, PRED, MAE, etc. After, further research is proposed on why using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) could be very beneficial for developing Software Cost Prediction Models. This technique combines Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) and can solve complex tasks with many variables and a rapidly developing environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Projects are critical to organizations' success; hence improving project management (PM) is imperative. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many disciplines, including PM. Applying AI techniques in PM can lead to more control for the project manager and better management of projects. One of the inherent problems faced in PM is related to human error by the project managers leading to project failure. Project managers use PM software and tools to improve their tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of AI in project management through a bibliometric analysis and keyword analysis to show the state of the art of research on AI in PM in the past decade. We extracted 106 articles from the Web of Science database published between 2012 and 2021 and analyzed the data. VOSviewer provided visual maps revealing research hotspots in the field of AI in the HE knowledge base. Our analysis focuses on publication and citation trends, the geographic distribution of articles, analysis of papers by source in which they were published, h-index analysis, and keyword analysis. Results show that research in AI-based PM is widely distributed geographically, by the publisher, and by discipline or field. Furthermore, research in the corpus in the past decade has centered around four themes. The first theme relates to applying AI techniques to improve accuracy, precision, and prediction in software projects, project management, and development estimation. The second theme focuses on the application and development of AI for decision-making in PM. The third theme highlights the benefits of applying AI in PM, such as dealing with uncertainty, improving efficiency, scheduling, and stakeholder management. The last theme shows how AI manages risks and improves cost management in engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects. This research makes valuable contributions to the corpus by highlighting opportunities, challenges, and future research directions in AI in education. The study highlights its limitations and future research areas. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific},

	abstract = {Satellite communication is inevitable due to the Internet of Everything and the exponential increase in the usage of smart devices. Satellites have been used in many applications to make human life safe, secure, sophisticated, and more productive. The applications that benefit from satellite communication are Earth observation (EO), military missions, disaster management, and 5G/6G integration, to name a few. These applications rely on the timely and accurate delivery of space data to ground stations. However, the channels between satellites and ground stations suffer attenuation caused by uncertain weather conditions and long delays due to line-of-sight constraints, congestion, and physical distance. Though inter-satellite links (ISLs) and inter-orbital links (IOLs) create multiple paths between satellite nodes, both ISLs and IOLs have the same issues. Some essential applications, such as EO, depend on time-sensitive and error-free data delivery, which needs better throughput connections. It is challenging to route space data to ground stations with better QoS by leveraging the ISLs and IOLs. Routing approaches that use the shortest path to optimize latency may cause packet losses and reduced throughput based on the channel conditions, while routing methods that try to avoid packet losses may end up delivering data with long delays. Existing routing algorithms that use multi-optimization goals tend to use priority-based optimization to optimize either of the metrics. However, critical satellite missions that depend on high-throughput and low-latency data delivery need routing approaches that optimize both metrics concurrently. We used a modified version of Kleinrock’s power metric to reduce delay and packet losses and verified it with experimental evaluations. We used a cognitive space routing approach, which uses a reinforcement-learning-based spiking neural network to implement routing strategies in NASA’s High Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) project. © 2022 by the authors.},

Manufacturing sector has become a blue ocean market for AI due to its massive data accumulation. In 2019, AI met industrial Internet of Things at the edge layer, realizing the first year of AI in industrial flooring. The Asia-pacific region has emerged as a potential market for the industrial applications of AI. However, to what extent the use of AI will contribute to manufacturing sector in China remains largely unknown. In this study, qualitative data were collected using a questionnaire survey method. Twenty respondents from 5 different manufacturing enterprises in China were interviewed, and a set of questionnaires were issued to them. The measurement of time and budget commitments indicated that most of the respondents believed that AI projects did not meet enterprise expectations. This may be attributed to different influential factors such as research and development costs, technology monopoly, security issues and management factors. The present study aimed to understand the application status and development prospects of AI in Chinese manufacturing enterprises, fill in the gap between the ideal and reality of AI projects, and promote the economic growth of manufacturing industry.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Emerging precision agriculture techniques rely on the frequent collection of high-quality data which can be acquired efficiently by unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The main obstacle for wider adoption of this technology is related to UAS operational costs. The path forward requires a high degree of autonomy and integration of the UAS and other cyber physical systems on the farm into a common Farm Management System (FMS) to facilitate the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for decision support. Such a solution has been implemented in the EU project AFarCloud (Aggregated Farming in the Cloud). The regulation of UAS operations is another important factor that impacts the adoption rate of agricultural UAS. An analysis of the new European UAS regulations relevant for autonomous operation is included. Autonomous UAS operation through the AFarCloud FMS solution has been demonstrated at several test farms in multiple European countries. Novel applications have been developed, such as the retrieval of data from remote field sensors using UAS and in situ measurements using dedicated UAS payloads designed for physical contact with the environment. The main findings include that (1) autonomous UAS operation in the agricultural sector is feasible once the regulations allow this; (2) the UAS should be integrated with the FMS and include autonomous data processing and charging functionality to offer a practical solution; and (3) several applications beyond just asset monitoring are relevant for the UAS and will help to justify the cost of this equipment. © 2022, MDPI.

	abstract = {Shifting towards B5G/6G implicates for a great diversity of challenges for the involved markets, especially via the creation of vast amounts of generated data and of related novel applications serving a great multiplicity of verticals. Such innovative services exceed the capabilities of existing 5G infrastructures for potential support of their corresponding KPIs and computational offloading, thus creating a new generation of Smart Networks. Towards fulfilling this target, the 6G-BRICKS project aims to deliver a new 6G experimentation facility building on the baseline of mature platforms coming from ongoing EU-funded activities and bringing breakthrough cell-free (CF) and RIS technologies. We have presented the essential architectural structure of the above facility and assessed in detail the core objectives of the project, as these “identify” diverse technical challenges and dedicated areas for future research. In addition, we have discussed and evaluated the fundamental use cases together with their intended PoCs that are expected to demonstrate strong market impact. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and analysis of wildlife are key to conservation planning and conflict management. The widespread use of camera traps coupled with AI-based analysis tools serves as an excellent example of successful and non-invasive use of technology for design, planning, and evaluation of conservation policies. As opposed to the typical use of camera traps that capture still images or short videos, in this project, we propose to analyze longer term videos monitoring a large flock of birds. This project, which is part of the NSF-TIH Indo-US joint R&D partnership, focuses on solving challenges associated with the analysis of long-term videos captured at feeding grounds and nesting sites, among other such locations that host large flocks of migratory birds. We foresee that the objectives of this project would lead to datasets and benchmarking tools as well as novel algorithms that would be instrumental in developing automated video analysis tools that could in turn help understand individual and social behavior of birds. The first of the key outcomes of this research will include the curation of challenging, real-world datasets for benchmarking various image and video analytics algorithms for tasks such as counting, detection, segmentation, and tracking. Our recent efforts towards this outcome is a curated dataset of 812 high-resolution, point-annotated, images (4K - 32MP) of a flock of Demoiselle cranes (Anthropoides virgo) taken from their feeding site at Khichan, Rajasthan, India. The average number of birds in each image is about 207, with a maximum count of 1500. The benchmark experiments show that state-of-the-art vision techniques struggle with tasks such as segmentation, detection, localization, and density estimation for the proposed dataset. Over the execution of this open science research, we will be scaling this dataset for segmentation and tracking in videos, as well as developing novel techniques for video analytics for wildlife monitoring. © 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the use of the HORUS.AI solution, an AI-enabled persuasive personal health assistant built upon the integration of semantic web technologies and persuasive techniques, for motivating people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and for supporting them to cope with the self-management of chronic diseases associated with bad lifestyle habits. The solution collects data from users’ devices, explicit users’ inputs, or from the external environment (e.g., facts of the world), and interacts with users by using a goal-based metaphor. Persuasive dialogues are used for proposing persuasion goals to users that, through a mobile application, are able to provide the required information and to receive contextual motivational messages helping them to achieve the proposed goals. In this paper, we focus on how behavioral change strategies have been exploited for providing a personalized support concerning the adoption of healthy lifestyle or the management of their chronic diseases based on the results of personal data processing. Such results are produced by reasoning operations, briefly mentioned in this paper, and coded into motivational strategies and messages by a dialogue-based persuasive layer. This layer manages dialogues and generates persuasive messages based on (i) the information provided by the reasoner, (ii) the user’s behavior and profile, and (iii) the implemented behavioral change strategies. This way, messages are tailored to specific users. HORUS.AI has been validated within the context of the Key To Health project. Results demonstrated how the use of proposed approach supported users about improving their habits from the health perspectives as well as the overall good acceptability of the system by the users involved in the pilot study. Finally, the analysis of system’s efficiency shows how HORUS.AI can be deployed within a real-world scenarios. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Environmental landscaping is known to build, plan, and manage landscapes that consider the ecology of a site and produce gardens that benefit both people and the rest of the ecosystem. Landscaping and the environment are combined in landscape design planning to provide holistic answers to complex issues. Seeding native species and eradicating alien species are just a few ways humans influence the region's ecosystem. Landscape architecture is the design of landscapes, urban areas, or gardens and their modification. It comprises the construction of urban and rural landscapes via coordinating the creation and management of open spaces and economics, finding a job, and working within a confined project budget. There was a lot of discussion about global warming and water shortages. There is a lot of hope to be found even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. AI is becoming more significant in many urban landscape planning and design elements with the advent of web 4.0 and Human-Centred computing. It created a virtual reality-based landscape to create deep neural networks (DNNs) to make deep learning (DL) more user-friendly and efficient. Users may only manipulate physical items in this environment to manually construct neural networks. These setups are automatically converted into a model, and the real-time testing set is reported and aware of the DNN models that users are producing. This research presents a novel strategy for combining DL-DNN with landscape architecture, providing a long-term solution to the problem of environmental pollution. Carbon dioxide levels are constantly checked when green plants are in and around the house. Plants, on either hand, remove toxins from the air, making it easier to maintain a healthy environment.

	abstract = {The linguistic and social impact of multiculturalism can no longer be neglected in any sector, creating the urgent need of creating systems and procedures for managing and sharing cultural heritages in both supranational and multi-literate contexts. In order to achieve this goal, text sensing appears to be one of the most crucial research areas. The long-term objective of the DigitalMaktaba project, born from interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, historians, librarians, engineers and linguists, is to establish procedures for the creation, management and cataloguing of archival heritage in non-Latin alphabets. In this paper, we discuss the currently ongoing design of an innovative workflow and tool in the area of text sensing, for the automatic extraction of knowledge and cataloguing of documents written in non-Latin languages (Arabic, Persian and Azerbaijani). The current prototype leverages different OCR, text processing and information extraction techniques in order to provide both a highly accurate extracted text and rich metadata content (including automatically identified cataloguing metadata), overcoming typical limitations of current state of the art approaches. The initial tests provide promising results. The paper includes a discussion of future steps (e.g., AI-based techniques further leveraging the extracted data/metadata and making the system learn from user feedback) and of the many foreseen advantages of this research, both from a technical and a broader cultural-preservation and sharing point of view. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have gained significant traction in the recent past, creating new challenges in requirements engineering (RE) when building AI software systems. RE for AI practices have not been studied much and have scarce empirical studies. Additionally, many AI software solutions tend to focus on the technical aspects and ignore human-centered values. In this paper, we report on a case study for eliciting and modeling requirements using our framework and a supporting tool for human-centred RE for AI systems. Our case study is a mobile health application for encouraging type-2 diabetic people to reduce their sedentary behavior. We conducted our study with three experts from the app team - a software engineer, a project manager and a data scientist. We found in our study that most human-centered aspects were not originally considered when developing the first version of the application. We also report on other insights and challenges faced in RE for the health application, e.g., frequently changing requirements.

	abstract = {Accurately forecasting demand is one of the most undervalued and complex strategies that can significantly impact organizations bottom line. This industrial field study was co-conducted with Sumitomo Corporation's Tubular Division which primarily deals with high-grade Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) globally. The presented solution demonstrates how with the right data set (drilling sequence data, stock data and consumption data), artificial intelligence can be used to build out a model that can quantify and predict future demand accurately thereby reducing cost, working capital and emissions. Multiple multi-layered machine learning models were built to compare and analyze a wide variety of data inputs for bill of materials, operational/project schedules; This includes (a) 'product movement data' which describes the changes in demand and supply of a product, (b) 'product specification data' which describes the characteristics of a product, and (c) 'activity specification data' which describes the characteristics of an activity. The models follow the base temporal map design with different weighting on model inputs. With a temporal map, a sequence of monthly data values (called lags) is used to predict the next monthly value in the sequence. The lags are rolled so that there are six months of data for the model to predict on. All models also use boosted decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm. It is critical to understand how product movement metrics (actual and safety stock levels, historical forecasts, and consumption patterns), product specification data (lead time, product grade, well function, well category, work center), and external factors (oil price, rig counts, national budget, production targets) can be utilized together to better understand future product demand. Using historical data acquired from drilling operations and supply chain over an eight-year period, multiple machine learning models were trained to predict one year of demand across the most consumed products. Across five years of predictions (2016 to 2019), the models were able to predict with 78% average accuracy for the top 10 products by volume which represents 75% of inventory volume. Across the same time-period, they were able to predict with 73% average accuracy on all 17 products which account for 80% percent of inventory volume. Further iterative updates with additional data led to improvement in results and the model where the model predicted with an improved accuracy of 83% on the top 17 products and an accuracy of 86% on the top 10 products. Moreover, the data can also be used to generate dashboards featuring metrics on material uncertainty/velocity and expected differences between the internally predicted forecasts and actual sales. The results further indicate that, on average, and within a simulated environment (where shipping delays were not considered for instance,) the AI model can maintain a lower inventory than the originally planned stock levels at lowest cost and footprint. This would not only lead to less resource consumption, but also reduce the embodied carbon and emissions within the overall process. This novel study presents the success of a validated tailored AI model for inventory forecast with field data and commercial implementation. Such a tool can be integrated into other value adding digital tools, such as integrated schedule optimization, logistics optimization and management systems to make overall operations more efficient and sustainable with lower costs, inventory, wastage, and reduced emissions.

	abstract = {While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems promises to bring significant economic and social benefits, it is also coupled with ethical, legal, and technical challenges. Business leaders thus face the question of how to best reap the benefits of automation whilst managing the associated risks. As a first step, many companies have committed themselves to various sets of ethics principles aimed at guiding the design and use of AI systems. So far so good. But how can well-intentioned ethical principles be translated into effective practice? And what challenges await companies that attempt to operationalize AI governance? In this article, we address these questions by drawing on our first-hand experience of shaping and driving the roll-out of AI governance within AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company. The examples we discuss highlight challenges that any organization attempting to operationalize AI governance will have to face. These include questions concerning how to define the material scope of AI governance, how to harmonize standards across decentralized organizations, and how to measure the impact of specific AI governance initiatives. By showcasing how AstraZeneca managed these operational questions, we hope to provide project managers, CIOs, AI practitioners, and data privacy officers responsible for designing and implementing AI governance frameworks within other organizations with generalizable best practices. In essence, companies seeking to operationalize AI governance are encouraged to build on existing policies and governance structures, use pragmatic and action-oriented terminology, focus on risk management in development and procurement, and empower employees through continuous education and change management.

However, there is still an important gap between biodiversity research and the management of natural areas. This research project aims to reduce this gap by proposing spatial planning methods that robustly and accurately integrate socio-ecological issues. Artificial intelligence, and notably Constraint Programming, will play a central role and will make it possible to remove the methodological obstacles that prevent us from properly addressing the complexity and heterogeneity of sustainability issues in the management of ecosystems. The whole will be articulated in three axes: (i) integrate socio-ecological dynamics into spatial planning, (ii) rely on adequate landscape metrics in spatial planning, (iii) scaling up spatial planning methods performances.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to present a comprehensive review, critical analysis and implications of the augmented reality (AR) application and implementation in the construction industry arena and demonstrate the gaps along with the future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: The construction industry has been under pressure to improve its productivity, quality and sustainability. However, the conventional methods and technologies cannot respond to this industry's ever-growing demands while emerging and innovative technologies such as building information modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and AR have emerged and can be used to address this gap. AR application has been acknowledged as one of the most impactful technologies in the construction digitalization process. However, a comprehensive understanding of the AR application, its areas of effectiveness and overarching implications in a construction project life cycle remain vague. Therefore, this study uses an integration of systematic literature review and thematic analysis techniques to identify the phases of a construction project life cycle in which AR is the most effective, the current issues and problems of the conventional methods, the augmented parameters, the immediate effects of using AR on each phase and, eventually, the overall influence of AR on the entire project. Nvivo qualitative data analysis software was used to code, categorize and create themes from the collected data. The result of data analysis was used to develop four principal frameworks of the AR applications – design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and maintenance and defect inspection and management – and the gap analysis along with the future research agenda. Findings: The findings of this study indicated that the application of AR can be most effective in the following four stages of a project life cycle: design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and site management and maintenance, including site management and defect inspection. The results also showed that the application of AR technology in the construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies, saving time, meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Research limitations/implications: One of the main limitations of this study was the lack of materials and resources on the downfalls and shortcomings of using immersive technologies, AR, in the construction project life cycle. In addition, most of the reviewed papers were focused on the experiments with simulations and in the lab environment, rather than real experiments in real construction sites and projects. This may cause limitations and inaccuracy of the collected and reported data. Practical implications: The results of this study indicated that the application of AR technology in construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies; saving time; meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling; and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Social implications: Application of AR in the various stages of a project life cycle can increase the safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Originality/value: The reviewed literature indicated that substantial research and studies are yet to be done, to demonstrate the full capacity and impact of these emerging technologies in the field. The collected data and literature indicate that amongst the digital technologies, AR is one of the least researched topics in the field. Therefore, this study aims to examine the application of AR in construction projects’ life cycle to identify the stages and practices of a project life cycle where AR and its capabilities can be exploited and to identify the respective problems and issues of the conventional methods and the ways in which AR can address those shortcomings. Furthermore, this study focuses on identifying the overall outcome of AR applications in a construction project in terms of cost and time efficiency, process precision and safety. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {With a higher awareness of sustainable development issues, the social costs of externalities of urban mobility have become unbearable. Whether in major cities improvement of transit may mitigate some of these drawbacks, in small municipalities countermeasures can be very challenging. Within this context, the “Smart Urban Mobility Management” (SUMMa) project it is trying to implement new technologies by making use of modern digital technologies and 5G communication networks for managing transportation systems in a small town. In this paper an application of a smart mobility paradigm based on a digital platform employing an enhanced Mobile Broadband, massive Machine Type Communications and Mobile Edge Computing, is presented. The digital platform has been conceived to help Artificial Intelligence algorithms for recognition image and interpretation of traffic field data, collected by H-D cameras. The system has been used to evaluate Origin-Destination flows on a real time basis. The estimated O/D matrix together with the collected traffic counts can be used in order to develop and calibrate a travel demand prediction model that will allow to evaluate urban mobility externalities.

	abstract = {In contemporary society people constantly are facing situations that influence appearance of serious diseases. For the development of intelligent decision support systems and services in medical and health domains, it is necessary to collect huge amount of patients’ complex data. Patient’s multimodal data must be properly prepared for intelligent processing and obtained results should be presented in a friendly way to the physicians/caregivers to recommend tailored actions that will improve patients’ quality of life. Advanced artificial intelligence approaches like machine/deep learning, federated learning, explainable artificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of medical and health data in future. In this paper, we will focus on presentation of a part of a novel Open AI Architecture for cancer patients that is devoted to intelligent medical data management. Essential activities are data collection, proper design and preparation of data to be used for training machine learning predictive models. Another key aspect is oriented towards intelligent interpretation and visualisation of results about patient’s quality of life obtained from machine learning models.

In the context of visitor flow management for instance, ABM can function as a possible decision support tool for policy makers to better understand and evaluate the dynamics of future scenarios and proposed policy changes towards a more economically, socially and environmentally resilient tourism development altogether. The following paper discusses the potential and implications of agent-based models in tourism research with a complex system approach in regard to ABM’s inherent elements of agents, interactions and environment.

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Bahrain took many actions to ensure social distancing. Turning to digital communication was a significant step taken by many organizations, public and private, to keep everyone safe, along with continuous achievement and development. A case study was conducted with the Bahrain Tender Board on e-tendering system users, including employees of the Bahrain Tender Board, purchasing authorities, suppliers, and contractors. This study investigated the causes of the increase in the tender’s value in Bahrain during the pandemic while shifting to the e-tendering system. These factors included safety and security, cost, ease of use, and accessibility. To collect data, a survey was distributed to a sample of e-tendering system users, and 127 responses were received. A five-level Likert scale was used in the questionnaire, and the data were analyzed with SPSS and Microsoft Excel. The findings from the study demonstrated that the mentioned factors had an impact on the e-tendering process, and digitalization resulted in a reduction in suppliers’ participation and increased the value of tenders in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The researcher provided recommendations, such as focusing on digitalization, coping with technology that is improving day by day, and new innovations and ideas. Furthermore, some digital communication factors should be handled with utmost care, such as the safety and security of users and accessibility. The study showed that these factors were highly effective for successful project management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the most recent advancements and outcomes of the European 6G flagship project Hexa-X, on the topic of in-network Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). We first present a general introduction to the project and its ambitions in terms of use cases (UCs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and key value indicators (KVIs). Then, we identify the key challenges to realize, implement, and enable the native integration of AI and ML in 6G, both as a means for designing flexible, low-complexity, and reconfigurable networks (learning to communicate), and as an intrinsic in-network intelligence feature (communicating to learn or, 6G as an efficient AI/ML platform). We present a high level description of down selected technical enablers and their implications on the Hexa-X identified UCs, KPIs and KVIs. Our solutions cover lower layer aspects, including channel estimation, transceiver design, power amplifier and distributed MIMO related challenges, and higher layer aspects, including AI/ML workload management and orchestration, as well as distributed AI. The latter entails Federated Learning and explainability as means for privacy preserving and trustworthy AI. To bridge the gap between the technical enablers and the 6G targets, some representative numerical results accompany the high level description. Overall, the methodology of the paper starts from the UCs and KPIs/KVIs, to then focus on the proposed technical solutions able to realize them. Finally, a brief discussion of the ongoing regulation activities related to AI is presented, to close our vision towards an AI and ML-driven communication and computation co-design for 6G. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this research project, we are creating an IoTenabled adaptive AI technique for effective fluid management. Floods in Kerala, India, have recently seriously damaged the environment, infrastructure, and population. Various IoT devices gathered information on temperature, precipitation rates, and other variables. This study uses a real-time flood visualisation technology to provide an information system for flood monitoring. A system is constructed by first creating two systems: a client system comprised of hardware for detecting floods and a server system comprised of software for monitoring floods and distributing the collected data. All of the information on the flood in Kerala is compiled and split in halves, with the first set serving as training data and the second as test data. The suggested hybrid model is trained using six different machine learning models, and it achieves a maximum accuracy of 99.64%. We were able to prevent losses because to the system's seamless design. Research reveals that the client of the flood detection system may deliver real-time data on flood levels, weather conditions, and temperatures. Additionally, data from client systems can be collected by flood monitoring information systems and stored in MySQL. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) that can train using machine learning methods without moving data have attracted interest owing to the focus on data privacy. Several FL platforms and frameworks are being developed with various open datasets. However, FL has not yet been fully utilized in real-world projects; instead, centralized ML models are still being used for AI. Since FL is composed of numerous clients and executed, it is necessary to manage the lifecycle such as model deployment and status management to multiple clients in order to operate FL. This study proposes FLScalize to enable AI researchers to apply their own custom data and models to FL environments and to deploy and manage the FL lifecycle. Researchers who develop these models should be able to easily and conveniently apply custom data and models developed in a centralized environment to FL environments, deploy and train multiple clients, and manage the lifecycle of the entire FL process. FLScalize can be used to simulate system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity, both of which are FL issues that occur in real FL environments. Furthermore, FLScalize provides a manager component that continuously manages the FL client and server required for real-world FL tasks and realizes an FL lifecycle management implementation that enables continuous integration, deployment, and training.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in construction projects has surged in recent years and is believed to represent a significant potential for increasing productivity and efficiency in the industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art view of the field by conducting a review of publications concerning the topic of AI in construction and comparing the findings to previously conducted reviews. This paper provides an overview of the recent and current uses of AI in construction projects, through a descriptive analysis of the characteristics and contents of 86 peer-reviewed articles from 2015 to 2020. Although the application of AI in the industry is not entirely new, construction appears to currently be behind other industries in terms of adopting and adapting to AI. The results show that a wide range of research is conducted on AI in construction projects. A limited number of publication channels and authors stand behind a significant part of the reviewed publications. Most studies are conceptual or use a mixed-methods research design. The research addresses several areas of application, but there is a predominance of quantitatively based subfields of construction, such as estimation and cost control, logistics, planning, and scheduling. Future research should focus on developing holistic and process-oriented frameworks for projects to move from ambition to practice. Findings can inform the future development and implementation of AI in the construction industry context. For researchers, this study identifies areas in need of further attention and examines possibilities for future exploration of multidisciplinary approaches that combine construction engineering, project management, AI, and social science. For practitioners, the study highlights current trends and work within the field, providing an overview of the potential for pilot studies, tests, and innovations.

	abstract = {This cutting-edge technological era is assisted by many innovative projects like the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented reality, Metaverse, and many more. Together, they resulted in a digital revolution called as the fourth industrial revolution, symbolised as 4IR or Industry 4.0. To increase people’s control over their personal data, these technologies must adhere to privacy regulations. Before initialising the interaction, every system authenticates users by means of a private/public key pair, a hardware token, third-party authentication software, or a username and password combination. Thus, the services accessed by users own their digital identity and are no longer in the control of users. Traditional identity management solutions rely on centralised certification authority (CA) to handle public key management and confirm the association of individuals with their individual keys. Consequently, they raise a number of security issues including the CA being the system’s single point of failure. In addition, with the current increase in users and the dispersed systems they utilise, maintaining public keys by a centralised CA is getting expensive. Additionally, centralised identity management solutions are incompatible and raise privacy issues. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems aim to address these difficulties by offering decentralised identity ecosystems that permit the registration and interchange of identity attributes and the propagation of trust across participating entities. Blockchain technology improves SSI security by allowing control of credential storage and disclosure. They increase data integrity, privacy, and interoperability. The study analyses how a blockchain-based decentralised identity management system can use SSI to deliver high-level security and transparency in Industry 4.0 environments. The effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has also been witnessed in securing Identity and Access Management (I&AM) procedures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The recent advancement in data science coupled with the revolution in digital and satellite technology has improved the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the forestry and wildlife sectors. India shares 7% of global forest cover and is the 8th most biodiverse region in the world. However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country’s rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India. We hope that this synthesis will motivate forest officials, scientists, and conservationists in India to explore AI technology for biodiversity conservation and forest management. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The exponential growth of mobile applications and services during the last years has challenged the existing network infrastructures. Consequently, the arrival of multiple management solutions to cope with this explosion along the end-to-end network chain has increased the complexity in the coordinated orchestration of different segments composing the whole infrastructure. The Zero-touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) concept has recently emerged to automatically orchestrate and manage network resources while assuring the Quality of Experience (QoE) demanded by users. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the key enabling technologies that many ZSM frameworks are adopting to bring intelligent decision making to the network management system. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art application of ML-based techniques to improve ZSM performance. To this end, the main related standardization activities and the aligned international projects and research efforts are deeply examined. From this dissection, the skyrocketing growth of the ZSM paradigm can be observed. Concretely, different standardization bodies have already designed reference architectures to set the foundations of novel automatic network management functions and resource orchestration. Aligned with these advances, diverse ML techniques are being currently exploited to build further ZSM developments in different aspects, including multi-tenancy management, traffic monitoring, and architecture coordination, among others. However, different challenges, such as the complexity, scalability, and security of ML mechanisms, are also identified, and future research guidelines are provided to accomplish a firm development of the ZSM ecosystem. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded systems have resulted on a recent increase in use of image processing applications for smart cities’ safety. This enables a cost-adequate scale of automated video surveillance, increasing the data available and releasing human intervention. At the same time, although deep learning is a very intensive task in terms of computing resources, hardware and software improvements have emerged, allowing embedded systems to implement sophisticated machine learning algorithms at the edge. Additionally, new lightweight open-source middleware for constrained resource devices, such as EdgeX Foundry, have appeared to facilitate the collection and processing of data at sensor level, with communication capabilities to exchange data with a cloud enterprise application. The objective of this work is to show and describe the development of two Edge Smart Camera Systems for safety of Smart cities within S4AllCities H2020 project. Hence, the work presents hardware and software modules developed within the project, including a custom hardware platform specifically developed for the deployment of deep learning models based on the I.MX8 Plus from NXP, which considerably reduces processing and inference times; a custom Video Analytics Edge Computing (VAEC) system deployed on a commercial NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform, which provides high level results on person detection processes; and an edge computing framework for the management of those two edge devices, namely Distributed Edge Computing framework, DECIoT. To verify the utility and functionality of the systems, extended experiments were performed. The results highlight their potential to provide enhanced situational awareness and demonstrate the suitability for edge machine vision applications for safety in smart cities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (CC) are different, which is why each technology has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the task/operation that a business wants to optimize. Nowadays, it is easy to confuse both by simply associating CC with the widespread theme of AI. This way, companies that want to implement AI know that what they want, in most cases, are the features provided by CC. It is important in these situations to know how to differentiate them, so that it is possible to identify in which circumstance one is more suitable than another, to get more out of the benefits that each has to offer. This project focuses on highlighting the capabilities of both technologies, more specifically in business contexts in which the implementation of intelligent systems and the interest of companies in them is favourable. It also identifies which aspects of these technologies are most interesting for companies. Based on this information, it is evaluated whether these aspects are relevant in decision making. Data analysis is carried out by employing partial least squares structural equations modelling (PLS-SEM) and descriptive statistical techniques. © 2022 by the authors.},

Therefore, this article aims to study the factors affecting artificial intelligence adoption and validate AI’s influence on supply chain risk mitigation (SCRM). Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the effect of factors based on the technology, organization and environment (TOE) framework and three other factors, including supply chain integration (SCI), information sharing (IS) and process factors (PF) on AI adoption. Data for the survey were collected from 297 respondents from Indian agro-industries, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for testing the proposed hypotheses. Findings: This study’s findings show that process factors, information sharing, and supply chain integration (SCI) play an essential role in influencing AI adoption, and AI positively influences SCRM. The technological, organizational and environmental factors have a nonsignificant negative relation with artificial intelligence. Originality/value: This study provides an insight to researchers, academicians, policymakers, innovative project handlers, technology service providers, and managers to better understand the role of AI adoption and the importance of AI in mitigating supply chain risks caused by disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Demand Response (DR) has gained popularity in recent years as a practical strategy to increase the sustainability of energy systems while reducing associated costs. Despite this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), have recently developed as critical technologies for demand-side management and response due to the high complexity of tasks associated with DR, as well as huge amount of data management to take decisions very near to real time implications. Selecting the best group of users to respond, learning their attitude toward consumptions and their priorities, price optimization, monitoring and control of devices, learning to engage more and more consumers in the DR schemes, and learning how to remunerate them fairly and economically are all problems that can be tackled with the help of AI techniques. This study presents an overview of AI approaches used for DR applications. Both the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithm(s) are employed while discussing commercial efforts (from both new and existing businesses) and large-scale innovation projects that have applied AI technologies for energy DR. Different kind of DR programs implemented in different countries are also discussed. Moreover, it also discusses the application of blockchain for DR schemes in smart grid paradigm.

	abstract = {Forecasting-based skills management, which is oriented to the respective corporate goals, is gaining enormous importance as a central management tool. The aim is to predict future skills requirements and match them with existing interorganizational skills. Companies are required to anticipate changes in markets, industries, and technologies at an early stage as well as to identify changes in job profiles within an occupational profile by tapping into and evaluating various data sources. Based on these findings, they can then make informed decisions regarding skill gaps, for example, to implement targeted further training measures. Forecasting-based skills management offers the opportunity to optimally qualify employees for constantly changing tasks. At the same time, however, the targeted development of such skills requires a high level of time, financial and personnel resources, which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally do not have at their disposal. In addition, many SMEs are not yet aware of the importance of this issue. Within the framework of research and industrial projects of the Smart Work department at the FIR (Institute for Industrial Management) at the RWTH Aachen University, an AI-based skills forecasting tool will be developed. The goal of the paper is to conceptualize the future machine learning method, that is able to generate individualized skills forecasts and recommendations for SMEs. This is achieved by linking societal forecasts and sector trends with company-specific conditions and skills. In order to generate a corresponding database, the derivation system is made available to various companies (large companies and SMEs) in order to obtain as many data sets as possible. The data sets obtained via the derivation system are then used as training data sets for the machine learning method, with the help of which an automatic derivation of competencies depending on new trends is to be made possible. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

	abstract = {Almost everywhere, organizations or individuals can adopt technologies that can be supportive to make decisions and get insight from data: artificial intelligence (AI) is an advanced new technology which is used to aid organizations in their business procedures, organizational factors, and human resources management. Employees are the nucleus of the organization. When employees leave an institution of their own volition, the company suffers greatly from various dimensions. Nowadays, we have seen a huge change in companies due to COVID-19; employees are getting fired or resigning voluntarily. It is a big issue to keep the productivity constant of a company or individual as human resources (HR) has to spend a lot of time, from the selection process to the training process. In these circumstances, minimizing the attrition rate is one of the primary concerns of the Human Resource department, which deals with staffing, development, and compensation. From this point of view, more research projects have been done through statistical analysis and applying various types of machine learning (ML) and data mining techniques such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, decision trees, etc. In this paper, a state-of-the-art boosting method, CatBoost, and a feature engineering process have been applied for detecting and analyzing employee attrition. Our detection system shows the utmost performance compared to the other existing systems and sorts out the significant reasons behind the attrition. It reveals the best recall rate of 0.89, with an accuracy of.8945. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {Optimization is one of the oldest sciences or practices. Since the beginning of mankind, people strived for perfection when it came to their creations, products, gains, or self-improvement. Extension of activities and their cost, time, and resource limitations have caused researchers to pay their attention to optimizing the activities in construction management engineering. Rapid development in optimization techniques to solve related problems in structural design can be achieved accordingly. In this paper, meta-heuristic algorithms used for strength, energy, and cost optimization of building material in construction management. The novel meta-heuristic algorithm can be used for electricity cost and peak load alleviation with the minimum user waiting time. The proposed model is implemented in a smart building in terms of electricity cost estimation for both a single smart home and a smart building. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme for single and multiple smart homes in terms of strength, energy, and cost optimization of building material in construction management engineering. This study has used the artificial intelligence (AI) model as particle swarm optimization (PSO) model to calculate the accurate and material-specific energy of three commonly used building materials as fly ash, copper slag, and phospo-gypsum. Two regression models as root mean square (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to calculate the results. Following the results of (R2) and RMSE, PSO has shown its higher performance in predicting the strength, energy, and cost of building materials besides revealing a significant and positive correlation among them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The conceptual design decisions have the largest influence on a building project's safety, value, and environmental impact; hence they are commonly assigned to a “senior engineer” to make use of his/her experience. However, the senior engineers can be biased towards solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process; however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types) to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this article, we present the development and validation of a genetic algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional conceptual design process. For future applications, the methodology presented in this paper is flexible to include more engineering materials (e.g., timber, masonry, structural glass), complex architectural forms and merge other disciplines in decision making (e.g., building physics construction management, fire safety). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {During the execution control of their initiatives, organisations use a variety of devices to aid independent direction. Regardless, they are still insufficient in the face of skewed statistics and shifting management approaches. The absence of frameworks for controlling the execution of enterprises has an impact on the nature of their categorization in terms of supporting independent direction. The presentation of soft registering methods, which provide heartiness, effectiveness and flexibility at apparatuses, is an optional arrangement. This research provides a technique for project execution control based on Soft Computing and ML, which contributes to the executives’ ability to further improve the project. The proposed method allows for AI and the replacement of fuzzy inference frameworks in project evaluation. The results are derived from seven calculations involving space apportioning, neural architecture, gradient descent and genetic algorithms.

Satellite images provide a large-scale dataset that can be used for various purposes such as land cover classification, item counting, and detection. This project investigates the use of human intent questions for effective method for obtaining data from satellite imaging data. Users can query the system to retrieve meaningful data about regarding image entities or relationships among items depicted in the images. Developing high-performing and reliable VQA systems is a challenging task, particularly in the context of disaster management and infrastructure. In this work, we examine traditional combination methods such as addition, concatenation, and feature-wise multiplication using state-of-the-art image and text feature extraction models. We present simple and efficient system that outperforms existing techniques on the FloodNet dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our streamlined solution requires significantly less training and inference time than traditional VQA systems. We also evaluate the performance of several backbones and present their aggregated results. We propose to use a visual model to extract context information, translate it to text, and inject it into a language model. The language model then processes the question in conjunction with the visual context and extracts the information needed to generate a response. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A critical concern with the UK’s construction project progress monitoring and control techniques is their dependency on data collection, which is time-consuming and unproductive and may lead to various circumstances in managing projects. However, collecting and accurately analysing information from construction sites requires the development of technologies. As key AI technology, computer vision is a powerful tool for big data analysis which can address the above challenges. This study explores the status of computer vision-construction project management (CV-CPM) adoption and the main barriers to and incentives for its adoption within UK construction sites. In this respect, an extensive review of literature covering the AI technology in construction management, the concept, function, and usage of CV and its integration with CPM, including its benefits and drivers, and technical challenges was conducted with a specific focus on the UK construction industry. The study’s results indicated that construction practitioners are relatively aware of CV-CPM but lack competencies and skills. CV-CPM has been perceived to be relatively better than the traditional approach. Implications like the cost of implementation, lack of expertise, and resistance to change were the major challenges in CV-CPM adoption. Instead, technological development, decision-making, and competitiveness were classified as incentives for its adoption. The main contribution of this study is to provide construction professionals with a comprehensive list of barriers and incentives toward CV-CPM adoption. Industry practitioners might benefit from this research's findings and detailed evaluations to develop successful adoption and transformation strategies as CV-CPM can accelerate the progress detection and data accessibility for outcomes. © 2023 by CITC-13.},

	abstract = {As technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate, the effect it has on the adoption of Industry 4.0 is significant. The adoption of AI-based Industry 4.0 projects creates a significant opportunity to generate new revenue streams and high-value customer-centric products. However, medical device manufacturing organisations are strictly scrutinised by regulatory authorities due to the critical nature of these devices and their impact on humans. This presents a challenging environment for medical device manufacturers to experiment with and implement new technologies. However, the significance and impact of AI-based projects are acknowledged by regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA and PMDA, allowing the incorporation of AI-based devices. This change in regulations, although limited, opens up immense opportunities for medical device manufacturers. Although extensive studies on the barriers, challenges, and failure factors of AI projects are available, very few studies explore these from a medical device manufacturing perspective. This is essential due to the significant limitations posed by the regulations governing medical device development. This study analyses the challenges and factors affecting the scaling of AI-based Industry 4.0 projects in medical device manufacturing organisations. The study found three major factors influencing the scaling of AI-based Insutry 4.0 projects. They comprise infrastructural costs, security risks and a change management migration plan. However, investing in these factors with a view to scaling may create additional revenue sources and also help in reaching a faster return on investment. Such investments can also improve the overall productivity of the industry, allowing the creation of high-value customer-centric products. The perceived security risks in the industry were found to be higher than the risks analysed in previous literature, suggesting a need to create an informed workforce. The study also found that for effective implementation of scalable AI-based industry 4.0 projects a skilled workforce with a shared long-Term vision is required.  © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Remote Sensing (RS) have emerged as powerful tools with diverse applications in various fields as well as research domains, including environmental monitoring, disaster risk management, agriculture, and even aquaculture. In the Philippines, harnessing the potential of these technologies has been crucial for sustainable development and scientific-based decision-making. This paper presents an overview of collaborative efforts among academic institutions and government agencies in the Philippines initiated by the Department of Science and Technology's Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) to promote education, capacity building, and technology proliferation through Basic AI and Radar RS Training Series. The initiative stems from recognizing the pressing need to equip professionals, researchers, and students with the knowledge and skills required to harness earth observation data using AI, GIS, and Radar RS effectively. Several State Universities and Colleges, Higher Education Institutes, and Government Agencies across the archipelago have committed their infrastructure and manpower for this initiative. With multidisciplinary collaborations and continuous knowledge-sharing activities, these institutions and agencies are fostering a new generation of skilled professionals who can lead the way in integrating emerging technology into the realm of earth observation, leveraging AI and Radar RS for other research and development domains. With the national development goals in line, policymakers prioritize funding for research and educational initiatives, hence DOST-ASTI with the researchers of the Synthetic Aperture Radar and Automatic Identification System for Innovative Terrestrial Monitoring and Maritime Surveillance (SARwAIS) Project is able to expand its reach, covering the major islands in the country. Additionally, academic and governmental collaboration enables the development of joint research projects that address agency and institution-specific challenges, fostering technology transfer and knowledge dissemination. This paper highlights success stories and challenges faced during the implementation of these capacity-building initiatives, shedding light on strategies to enhance their impact and effectiveness in a tailored manner. Evaluation metrics are employed to assess the outcomes and gauge the R&D potential of earth observation data using AI, GIS, and Radar RS. Overall, the collaborative efforts in Basic AI and Radar RS Information, Education, and Communication campaign in the Philippines exemplify a dynamic model for other nations seeking to harness these transformative technologies in academic and national government levels. Through continuous refinement and inclusive engagement with communities, DOST-ASTI remains to be the country's hub for partnerships and collaborations using R&D in the field of space science and technology and other emerging technologies. © 2023 ACRS.

	abstract = {Agile project management based on minimum viable products has some benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return of investment that supports circular reinvesting and makes the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, agile also presents some intrinsic issues due to its iterative approach. Project information requires an efficient record of the requirements, aims, governance not only for the investors, owners or users but also to keep evidence in future health and safety and other statutory compliance-related issues. In order to address the agile project management issues and address new safety regulations, this paper proposes a project information model (PIM) based on a distributed ledger technology (DLT) with a ranked procedure for the verification and validation (V&V) of data. Each V&V phase inserts a process of authenticity, data abstraction and analytics that adds value to the information founded on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). The underlying DLT consists of smart contracts embedded on a private Ethereum blockchain. This approach supports a decentralised approach in which every project stakeholder owns, manages and stores the data.

	abstract = {Recently, the construction industry has benefited from the increased application of smart construction led by the core technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, such as BIM, AI, modular construction, and AR/VR, which enhance productivity and work efficiency. In addition, the importance of “Off-Site Construction (OSC)”, a factory-based production method, is being highlighted as modular construction increases in the domestic construction market as a means of productivity enhancement. The problem with OSC construction is that the quality inspection of Precast Concrete (PC) members produced at the factory and brought to the construction site is not carried out accurately and systematically. Due to the shortage of quality inspection manpower, a lot of time and money is wasted on inspecting PC members on-site, compromising inspection efficiency and accuracy. In this study, the major inspection items to be checked during the quality inspection are classified based on the existing PC member quality inspection checklist and PC construction specifications. Based on the major inspection items, the items to which AI technology can be applied (for automatic quality inspection) were identified. Additionally, the research was conducted focusing on the detection of cracks, which are one of the major types of defects in PC members. However, accurate detection of cracks is difficult since the inspection mostly relies on a visual check coupled with subjective experience. To automate the detection of cracks for PC members, video images of cracks and non-cracks on the surface were collected and used for image training and recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and object detection, one of the deep learning technologies commonly applied in the field of image object recognition. Detected cracks were classified according to set thresholds (crack width and length), and finally, an automated PC member crack detection system that enables automatic crack detection based on mobile and web servers using deep learning and imaging technologies was proposed. This study is expected to enable more accurate and efficient on-site PC member quality inspection. Through the smart PC member quality inspection system proposed in this study, the time required for each phase of the existing PC member quality inspection work was reduced. This led to a reduction of 13 min of total work time, thereby improving work efficiency and convenience. Since quality inspection information can be stored and managed in the system database, human errors can be reduced while managing the quality of OSC work systematically and accurately. It is expected that through optimizing and upgrading our proposed system, quality work for the precise construction of OSC projects can be ensured. At the same time, systematic and accurate quality management of OSC projects is achievable through inspection data. In addition, the smart quality inspection system is expected to establish a smart work environment that enables efficient and accurate quality inspection practices if applied to various construction activities other than the OSC projects. © 2022 by the authors.},

This is being achieved through the integration of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning. AI is continuously driving businesses to success and modernizing the world of projects. The research is based on a global human capital management company as a case study to investigate on the issues that they face to meet their software project deadlines and then proposing a framework using AI to overcome their challenges. The mixed methods research with both qualitative and quantitative design was opted for this research. A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out initially to identify the challenges involved in meeting project deadlines as a primary method for data collection. Focus group interviews were then carried out to collect data from team members and project managers working on projects and facing challenges to meet project deadlines. The proposed AI framework was then evaluated and 72.7% participants rated the framework as effective and was keen to integrate AI at their workplace for smooth transition of tasks. A final framework was then proposed after the feedback received from participants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Visually challenged people, including children and elderly people with low vision, still have trouble performing everyday tasks, even in this world of rapidly developing technologies. The existing solutions provide a straight forward solution using Artificial Intelligence technologies. To take this technological solution to the next level we propose a solution with all the AI features seamlessly integrated together and a dedicated mobile application gives full control and independency to their life. The A-Eye (smart glasses) system that is being proposed consists of a wearable smart glass solution, a mobile application, and a cloud-based data management platform. This project shows how Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can be used to process data on the mobile phone other than to process the camera's video stream in the cloud or locally at the system level. The project's use of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) expands the scope of its ability to add and update an endless number of features without being constrained by hardware. Therefore, the suggested smart glass system can minimize latency and be highly scalable while using heavy and effective models to effectively mitigate the problem and assist visually challenged individuals. © 2023 IEEE.},

The process of diagnosis starts with the modelling of the investigated system and determination of measuring points. Sensors using the LoRaWAN technology are placed at these positions to measure and upload the data to the cloud. Different cloud services process the data to determine ways of optimization. To simplify and centralize the management of the used devices an application is developed, that will handle the registering of the devices in the cloud services and give an overview of a system and its measuring points. By comparing different cloud services and application frameworks, it was possible to create an easy-to-use and reliable system that handles the data flow and processing from the sensor to the diagnosis tool and guides the technician in placing and managing the sensors on site.  © 2023 IEEE.},

During the next phase (Phase II), the task force interviewed industry leaders regarding their information systems education needs with a focus on emerging BDA and AI needs. This report builds on Phase I and Phase II results and associated feedback from project stakeholders and outlines an IS curriculum framework that identifies projected competency levels for key IS competency areas (both new and changing) within the main IS program types related to BDA and AI education (undergraduate and graduate programs; IS programs, other business programs, and non-business programs) in the coming decade.

In response, an increasing number of universities are establishing new courses in data and information science. Traditionally, engineering students at universities and colleges study basic, specialized, and experimental subjects from admission to graduation, following the curriculum map. From the curriculum maps of various universities, it can be seen that specialized subject credits have been increased gradually, while balancing the speed of credit acquisition in general subjects. However, newly established information science universities and faculties are designing curriculum maps that allow students to evenly study specialized subjects over four years, rather than following the annual step-by-step acquisition of specialized subjects. These curriculum maps also include subjects related to Total System Engineering and management, which are essential to information and data science. However, few universities teach the basics of project management and system engineering.

	abstract = {The main aims of urban air pollution monitoring are to optimize the interaction between humanity and nature, to combine and integrate environmental databases, and to develop sustainable approaches to the production and the organization of the urban environment. One of the main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective data integration and management are a key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current complicated operating conditions, as well as taking into account the time, computing power, and constraints in the context of environmental injustice. © 2022 by the authors.

This artificial intelligence improves learning and student development in academic performance. Challenges of the conventional education approach, students' dependence on teachers in all resources for study, unavailability of professional instructors, and a greater focus on conditioning learning than practical usefulness lead to lower learning performance. In this paper integrated teaching-learning model approach has been proposed using artificial intelligence in student education. It involves speeding up fulfilling education targets by reducing barriers to entry, automating management processes, and maximizing learning performance. The proposed ITLMA method used the naive Bayes algorithm to evaluate the student ranking using a class score, task, project score, and final exam. The result of artificial intelligence-based ITLMA and naive Bayes algorithm hasa high accuracy ratio of 80.1% with less error ratio of 15.7%, high prediction 88.2%, precision 98.2%, and improves student and teacher interaction compared to other existing methods.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Drawing on six months of experimenting with LLMs in internal and client innovation projects, we share first-hand experiences and concrete examples of AI-assisted approaches. The article highlights a large variety of use cases for generative AI ranging from user journey mapping to idea generation and prototyping and foreshadows the promising role LLMs may play in future knowledge management systems. Moreover, we argue that generative AI may become a game changer in early prototyping as the delegation of tasks to an artificial agent can result in faster iterations and reduced costs.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the research is to explore how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in central China achieve intelligent transformation through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of unequal resource allocation, constraints on the intelligent transformation of SMEs in central China are different from those in economically and technologically well-developed coastal provinces. Hence, the authors focus on SMEs in central China to identify drivers of and barriers to intelligent transformation. Design/methodology/approach: The interview data were collected from 66 SMEs across 20 industries in central China. To verify the validity of the data collection method, the authors used two methods to control for retrospective bias: multi-level informants and enterprises' AI project application materials (Wei and Clegg, 2020). The final data were validated without conflicts. Next, the authors cautiously followed a two-step approach recommended by Venkatesh et al. (2010) and used NVivo 11.0 to analyze the collected text data. Findings: SMEs in central China are enthusiastic about intelligent transformation while facing both internal and external pressures. SMEs need to pay attention to both internal (enterprise development needs, implementation cost, human resources and top management involvement) and external factors (external market pressure, convenience of AI technology and policy support) and their different impacts on intelligent transformation. However, constrained by limited resources, SMEs in central China have been forced to take a step-by-step intelligent transformation strategy based on their actual needs with the technological flexibility method in the short term. Originality/value: Considering the large number of SMEs and their importance in promoting China's economic development and job creation (SME Bureau of MIIT, 2020), more research on SMEs with limited resources is needed. In the study, the authors confirmed that enterprises should handle “social responsibility” carefully because over-emphasizing it will hinder intelligent transformation. However, firms should pay attention to the role of executives in promoting intelligent transformation and make full use of policy support to access more resources. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Project management methods and practice address project success and the well-known “iron triangle” targeting time, cost, and quality trade-off have great importance in this process. Quality optimization, including safety and sustainability, plays a key role in construction project management choices. Since the relationship between quality, time and cost can be different from case to case, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed for this purpose. The objective of the research work in this chapter is to demonstrate that AI applications can help project managers the trade-off between time, cost, and quality objectives. A comprehensive approach concerning three estimates of time, cost, and quality of project activities is proposed to optimize project performance in construction. The proposed approach implements a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize project performances, with the aim of creating a decision support system for construction project managers. Genetic algorithm is an AI application that creates a learning optimization process that discards worse solutions and re-introduces better solutions to search for an optimal or sub-optimal solution. Therefore, time, cost, and quality trade-off can be performed by a multi-objective genetic algorithm that evaluates the effectiveness of various combinations, selecting better solutions with an iterative process. Therefore, the most suitable balance between the three project targets can be achieved. A simple case study of a deep renovation project of two residential is presented to evaluate the proposed approach with a sample application. This study contributes to the understanding of AI applications for construction management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Although many artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based algorithms are being developed by researchers, only a small fraction has been implemented in clinical-decision support (CDS) systems for clinical care. Healthcare organizations experience significant barriers implementing AI/ML models for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes. In this perspective, we delve into the numerous and diverse quality control measures and responsibilities that emerge when moving from AI/ML-model development in a research environment to deployment in clinical care. The Sleep-Well Baby project, a ML-based monitoring system, currently being tested at the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht, serves as a use-case illustrating our personal learning journey in this field. We argue that, in addition to quality assurance measures taken by the manufacturer, user responsibilities should be embedded in a quality management system (QMS) that is focused on life-cycle management of AI/ML-CDS models in a medical routine care environment. Furthermore, we highlight the strong similarities between AI/ML-CDS models and in vitro diagnostic devices and propose to use ISO15189, the quality guideline for medical laboratories, as inspiration when building a QMS for AI/ML-CDS usage in the clinic. We finally envision a future in which healthcare institutions run or have access to a medical AI-lab that provides the necessary expertise and quality assurance for AI/ML-CDS implementation and applies a QMS that mimics the ISO15189 used in medical laboratories.

	abstract = {In order to monitor water resource projects, this study examines the use of Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts in the context of dam projects. A survey of the body of knowledge on the subject of water resource project monitoring methods is the first stage in the research project. In this research, we'll focus on the advantages of use SPC charts to achieve that objective. Water resource projects are crucial pieces of infrastructure, and as such, they need constant supervision to ensure that they continue to operate properly and efficiently. SPC, or statistical process control, is a technique used for quality control and process monitoring across a wide range of industries. On the other hand, traditional SPC methodologies might not be suitable for real-time monitoring of water resource projects due to the complexity and unpredictability of water systems. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have lately gained attention as a potential solution to these issues. In this paper, we provide an artificial intelligence-based SPC framework for real-time monitoring and quality control of projects involving water resources using a case study of a dam building project. The framework that has been proposed combines SPC with machine learning techniques to automatically detect anomalies and predict how the system will behave in the future. The results show that the artificial intelligence-based SPC framework outperforms the traditional SPC techniques in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and efficiency. The framework has the potential to improve the management and long-term profitability of water resource projects, which would ultimately aid in preserving the environment and the general public's health. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

Intelligence amplification does not replace human decision makers but may help especially professionals in making complex decisions by well-designed human-AI system learning interactions (i.e., triple loop learning). To understand the adoption challenges of intelligence amplification systems, we analyse the adoption of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an organizational learning process by the case of a CDSS implementation for deciding on administering antibiotics to prematurely born babies. We identify user-oriented single and double loop learning processes, triple loop learning, and institutional deutero learning processes as organizational learning processes that must be realized for effective intelligence amplification adoption. We summarize these insights in a system dynamic model—containing knowledge stocks and their transformation processes—by which we analytically structure insights from the diverse studies of CDSS and intelligence amplification adoption and by which intelligence amplification projects are given an analytic theory for their design and management. From our case study, we find multiple challenges of deutero learning that influence the effectiveness of IA implementation learning as transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge back to tacit knowledge. In a discussion of implications, we generate further research directions and discuss the generalization of our case findings to different organizations. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Qualitative methods were utilised, including an extensive literature search, 32 interviews, a project visit, and participation in chosen seminars. Additionally, quantitative methods included an analysis of waste quantities in 161 construction projects, selected based on criteria for availability of data, as well as a targeted questionnaire with 21 respondents. Several methods were employed as means of triangulation, to increase the validity and reliability of the data in a complex and rapidly developing field. The study uncovers several possibilities and concludes with 18 proposed measures for waste reduction on a construction site, along with a set of recommendations for practical implementation. The recommended measures include defining appropriate targets for waste production, optimising resources, tracking continuously, reporting and presenting waste quantities, training, conducting inspections, and implementing specific routines for warehousing. The study helps bridge the gap between ambition and practice by highlighting considerations related to the practical implementation of measures for waste management and providing an understanding of which AI-based tools and measures are considered effective for waste reduction in construction projects.

	abstract = {Tackling the grand challenges of 21st century agriculture (Ag) will require a fundamental shift in the way we envision the role of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and in the way we build agricultural AI systems. This shift is needed especially for complex, high-value agricultural ecosystems such as those in the Western U.S., where 300+ crops are grown. Farmers and policy makers in this region face variable profitability, major crop loss and poor crop quality owing to several challenges, including increased labor costs and shortages of skilled workers, weather and management uncertainties, and water scarcity. While AI is expected to be a significant tool for addressing these challenges, AI capabilities must be expanded and will need to account for human input and human behavior – calling for a strong AI-Ag coalition that also creates new opportunities to achieve sustained innovation. Accomplishing this goal goes well beyond the scope of any specific research project or disciplinary silo and requires a more holistic transdisciplinary effort in research, development, and training. To respond to this need, we initiated the AgAID Institute, a multi-institution, transdisciplinary National AI Research Institute that will build new public-private partnerships involving a diverse range of stakeholders in both agriculture and AI. The institute focuses its efforts on providing AI solutions to specialty crop agriculture where the challenges pertaining to water availability, climate variability and extreme weather, and labor shortages, are all significantly pronounced. Our approach to all AgAID Institute activities is being guided by three cross-cutting principles: (i) adoption as a first principle in AI design; (ii) adaptability to changing environments and scales, and (iii) amplification of human skills and machine efficiency. The AgAID Institute is conducting a range of activities including: using agricultural AI applications as testbeds for developing innovative AI technologies and workflows; laying the technological foundations for climate-smart agriculture; serving as a nexus for culturally inclusive collaborative and transdisciplinary learning and knowledge co-production; preparing the next generation workforce for careers at the intersection of Ag and AI technology; and facilitating technology adoption and transfer. © 2022},

	abstract = {Any country's economic progress, especially economic expansion, depends heavily on the building industry. The construction industry consumes tremendous amount of money, time and energy. Over the last two decades, many reports and studies have concluded that quality and productivity are decreasing due to defective work. The corrective activities of addressing defects and rework, consume time and cost. Even though there are several reasons for cost and time overrun, rework has a significant effect. It is essential to emphasize the impact of construction rework, construction defects and waste generated through research. Use of soft computing methods is recommended to increase the general efficiency of the construction projects. The goal of this research study is to undertake a bibliographic survey of the relevant literature on construction rework, construction defects and the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to optimize the output. The time considered for this survey is from the year 2007-2022. This bibliographic analysis contains statistics on citations, important journals, countries, authors contributing to the domain of knowledge based on search engine on Web of Science database.

Banks, and other financial institutions, are increasingly incorporating data about ESG performances, with particular reference to risks posed by climate change, into their credit and investment portfolios evaluation methods. However, collecting the data related to ESG performances of corporate and businesses is still a difficult task. There exist no single source from which we can extract all the data. Furthermore, most important ESG data is in unstructured format, hence collecting it poses many technological and methodological challenges. In this paper we propose a method that addresses the ESG data collection problem based on AI-based approaches. We also present the implementation of the proposed method and discuss some experiments carried out on real world documents. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the efficiency of customer service. This study contributes to services technological innovation in process management, a field not yet settled in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: AI is a multidisciplinary field of research that has stood out for the technological dynamism provided to organizational products and processes. The study was carried out at an Analytical Intelligence Unit (AIU) of a Brazilian commercial bank that applies AI integrated with IBM's Watson system. The study used data content analysis, structured and supported by Atlas.ti software. Findings: The notorious AI cognitive maturity evolution allowed 181 million interactions and 7.6 million attendances in 2020, improving services efficiency, with gains in agility, availability, accessibility, resoluteness, predictability and transshipment capacity. The chatbot service reduced the queues of call centers and relationship centers, allowing the human attendant to perform more complex attendances. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this study relate to the research cutout and its borders, such as the choice of participants and their areas of activity, and the choice of the unit of analysis. Practical implications: The results indicated that attendance through the virtual assistant increased by more than a 1,000% from 2019 to 2020, demonstrating the bank was technologically ready to face the Covid-19 pandemic effects. Originality/value: In line with the evolutionary theory of innovation, the authors concluded that technological scaling in AI allows exponential gains in customer service efficiency and business process management. They also conclude that the strategy for creating AIUs is successful, once it allows centralizing, structuring and coordinating AI projects in R&D cooperation, cognitive computing and analytics. © 2022, Ivan Martins De Andrade and Cleonir Tumelero.},

	abstract = {The study's major goal will be understanding the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in the human resources management, particularly in Bahrain. Also, to look into the issues that have arisen as a result of training programs launched in Bahrain's public sector. The training and development of employees are two of the most important topics tackled. The importance of training in delivering the required knowledge and capabilities should not be overlooked. As a result, the training must be successful enough to meet these goals. This study examines a number of contextual elements that have been discovered to have an impact on vocational training in different combinations with other previously examined effective factors. It will enquire into their relationship. It also identifies the various types of relationships that exist between the efficiency of training and environmental elements. The Kirkpatrick training model is used to build the study's framework. This paradigm has four stages that measure the success of training: reaction, learning, behavior, and result. This modest study project offers a glimpse into the future of employing AI to better understand HR practitioners’ attitudes and perspectives across a variety of systems. According to the study, Bahrain's public sector has been a tremendous potential in order to keep pace with the digital revolution by implementing its vision (2030 vision). As a result, the staff mix of commercial organizations has changed. It gives men and women the opportunity to compete in a variety of occupations. As a result of the requirement for gender equality, human resource management will be burdened in new ways. This also allows for a nice feminist component to be included. It is suggested that current artificial intelligence be used as a foundational method for firms that operate in a volatile environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The challenging situations and disruptions that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have created a severe need for supply chain resiliency (SCR). There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR. Future research directions are proposed for AI-enabled resilient supply chain management. This study will also provide several implications for supply chain managers to achieve the required resilience in their supply chains post COVID-19 by focusing on the elements of the proposed research framework. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM). © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: An early diagnosis together with an accurate disease progression monitoring of multiple sclerosis is an important component of successful disease management. Prior studies have established that multiple sclerosis is correlated with speech discrepancies. Early research using objective acoustic measurements has discovered measurable dysarthria. Method: The objective was to determine the potential clinical utility of machine learning and deep learning/AI approaches for the aiding of diagnosis, biomarker extraction and progression monitoring of multiple sclerosis using speech recordings. A corpus of 65 MS-positive and 66 healthy individuals reading the same text aloud was used for targeted acoustic feature extraction utilizing automatic phoneme segmentation. A series of binary classification models was trained, tuned, and evaluated regarding their Accuracy and area-under-the-curve. Results: The Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Accuracy of 0.82 on the validation dataset and an area-under-the-curve of 0.76 across 5 k-fold cycles on the training dataset. 5 out of 7 acoustic features were statistically significant. Conclusion: Machine learning and artificial intelligence in automatic analyses of voice recordings for aiding multiple sclerosis diagnosis and progression tracking seems promising. Further clinical validation of these methods and their mapping onto multiple sclerosis progression is needed, as well as a validating utility for English-speaking populations. © 2022},

Diver monitoring relies primarily on voice communication and a video stream that gives the operator a first-person view of the diver. However, in many cases underwater visibility can drop to just a few centimeters, leaving the diver only able to feel his way with his hands and the operator depended only on voice communication, making it very difficult for both of them to identify upcoming hazards. In the DeeperSense research project, we are attempting to reduce the limitations caused by poor underwater visibility by using a sonar in combination with an AI-based algorithm designed to translate the sonar signal into a visual image that is independent of the turbidity of the water and gives an overview of the situation where the eye can no longer see anything. Laboratory results show that visual information can be recovered from sonar data. © 2023 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While in the traditional understanding managers are single individuals that takes decisions as fractal parts of macro economy, the situation within supply chains is more complex. With the rise of sustainability considerations as well as with smart concepts, classical approaches of supply chain management were transformed from the “dilemma of operational planning”, described as the “magic square” into “magic cubes” integrating sustainability dimensions as well as flexibility. Beside these aspects, future supply chains have to consider that not only human stakeholder are involved in the interactions, but also artificial participants comprising weak Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based solutions. These artificial approaches force the reshaping of traditional supply chain structures together with their underlying supporting and management processes. The aim of the research is to outline a framework of design parameters for relevant decision situations in supply chain management, so that they can be designed and processed digitally and implemented into human-task-technology systems, with outline the way how managerial decision-making will be changed. First, the study creates a model of strategic and operative management decisions within supply chains by using approaches that are suitable for realizing as Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions together with methods from conjoint analysis, logistics curve theory and distributed investment appraisal to safeguard stakeholder-orientation. Since the authors were involved in several green transportation projects with a special focus on autonomous vehicles and related management solutions for the last-mile transportation, the developed model is empirically validated in the context of smart supply chains. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Designing (socially) intelligent systems for facilitating collaborations in human-human and human-AI teams will require them to have a basic understanding of principles underlying social decision-making. Partner selection - the ability to identify and select suitable partners for collaborative relationships - is one relevant component of social intelligence and an important ingredient for successful relationship management. In everyday life, decision to engage in joint undertakings are often based on impressions made during social interactions with potential partners. These impressions, and consequently, partner selection are informed by (non)-verbal behavioral cues. Despite its importance, research investigating how these impressions and partner selection decisions unfold in naturalistic settings seem to be lacking. Thus, in this paper, we present a project focused on understanding, predicting and modeling partner selection and understanding its relationship with human impressions in semi- naturalistic settings, such as social interactions, with the aim of informing future designing approaches of (hybrid) intelligence system that can understand, predict and aid in initiating and facilitating (current and future) collaborations.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {The combination of pervasive sensing and multimedia understanding with the advances in communications makes it possible to conceive platforms of services for providing telehealth solutions responding to the current needs of society. The recent outbreak has indeed posed several concerns on the management of patients at home, urging to devise complex pathways to address the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in combination with the usual diseases of an increasingly elder population. In this paper, we present TiAssisto, a project aiming to design, develop, and validate an innovative and intelligent platform of services, having as its main objective to assist both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) multi-pathological patients and healthcare professionals. This is achieved by researching and validating new methods to improve their lives and reduce avoidable hospitalisations. TiAssisto features telehealth and telemedicine solutions to enable high-quality standards treatments based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Three hundred patients are involved in our study: one half using our telehealth platform, while the other half participate as a control group for a correct validation. The developed AI models and the Decision Support System assist General Practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals in order to help them in their diagnosis, by providing suggestions and pointing out possible presence or absence of signs that can be related to pathologies. Deep learning techniques are also used to detect the absence or presence of specific signs in lung ultrasound images.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The AI algorithm was trained to maximise the total throughput in the network and to use the network efficiently.

	abstract = {Given the increasingly significant role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the global economy and the ever more competitive markets in which these companies operate, SMEs’ ability to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is of utmost importance. Due to constantly evolving social, environmental, and technological scenarios, the managers of these firms must increasingly focus on incorporating new tools such as AI into SME operations in order to enjoy their benefits. However, the subjectivity and complexity of this adaptation process makes integrated analyses of key factors challenging. The present study sought to develop a multi-criteria decision-support system that applies cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique in a neutrosophic context. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of previous studies and models by structuring the decision problem and identifying and understanding which factors should be central to adaptation initiative analyses. A panel of experts in AI were recruited to facilitate the construction of an analysis system that takes into account indeterminacy in decision-making processes. The results were validated by both the panel members and project managers at COTEC Portugal—a leading think-and-action network that seeks to advance technology diffusion and business innovation cooperation. The proposed system’s practical implications and benefits are also analyzed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

At the same time, many interesting concepts and insights have been gained at the intersection of these areas in recent years. For example, the behavior of future processes is now comprehensively predicted with the aid of Machine Learning. For the practical application of these findings, however, it is also necessary not only to know the expected course, but also to give recommendations and hints for the achievement of goals, i.e. to carry out comprehensive process planning. At the same time, an adequate integration of the aforementioned research fields is still lacking. In this article, we present a research project in which researchers from the AI and BPM field work jointly together.

	abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of press and attention. Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles. The author's aim is to set out obstacles and realistic alternatives for next generation project managers to apply AI in managing stakeholder expectations, resolving dissent and conflicts, and assuring flawless project delivery. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Traffic congestion is a problem that frequently arises. Congestion causes unpredictable travel times, the economy will be delayed, and people become stressed. Managing traffic is one strategy for reducing congestion. Congestion must be identified to make the traffic management process simpler. In this project, classification is carried out based on audio data and creates an application to identify congestion. To perform the classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes algorithm are used and compare the performance of both algorithms. AI-SKEMA (Aplikasi Identifikasi Suara Kemacetan) is a web-based application to identify a congestion. The application uses the Streamlit framework to create its website. This application functions as an identifier to determine the probability of the sample whether is it a congested or not congested road based on a model that is trained. In the process of developing this application, research is conducted to collect data at two red light intersections that were crowded and not crowded by recording the road sounds. Audio Data is labeled as CONGESTED and NOT CONGESTED. A model consisting of audio data is trained to get the identification results and its implemented on the web application. Based on the performance evaluation that has been carried out, Support Vector Machine has the best performance compared to Naïve Bayes, which has Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-Measure are 95%, 91%, 100%, and 89% respectively. The classifier system in the application precisely identifies the input sample and displays the probability of the sample based on the trained model.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In information system construction, online data migration is a very important link. At present, in different fields, people provide protection for online data migration through the way of project management to ensure the speed and efficiency of online migration. However, some problems may occur in the process of online data migration. In the development of contemporary sports, competitive sports, as the high-end stage of sports development, are constantly pursued by ordinary sports enthusiasts. Therefore, in the national fitness activities, how to combine the national fitness and competitive sports data to provide a more professional storage platform is a focus of research but also a problem to be solved in the process of online data migration. Because the data mining ID3 algorithm only supports querying and retrieving RowKey indexes, it does not support non-RowKey column indexing. Therefore, if you want to query non-RowKey indexes, the data mining ID3 algorithm will search the form in the overall scan, but the performance of this method is low. In order to improve the query speed of non-RowKey columns, this paper designs a secondary index function based on HBase. The sports competition action system can retrieve data from the secondary index of the query state, to avoid scanning the whole world and improve the search speed. In this paper, ID3 algorithm is used to combine national fitness and competitive sports data, which provides a guarantee for the migration of competitive sports data in the national fitness system. © 2022 Jianmin Xiang et al.},

	abstract = {Future's Educational small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are super intelligent learning with smart business education environment by using future of 4th technologies, Internet of Thing (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), digitalization and sustainability. These technologies would create smart education; however, barriers cause challenges to apply these technologies and create modern areas like e-learning and MOOCs. It is required to indicate these barriers and find out solutions to apply them and change humans' life to maintain the world. In this paper we will introduce the DOOST SME RANKING (DSRM) Model invented by Prof. Doost, through the 5th wave theory as solutions for Educational SMEs Development and learning and educational concerns in the future of 4th industrial revolution. In other words, this paper is a picture of the current business project environment in Educational SMEs Ranking. One of the primary objectives of this research is to allow educational actors, managers, policy makers, professors, researchers, and trainees to attain a more accurate understanding of the financial-educational economic structure of SMEs in educational sectors and also their scale of activities. This research was made by FHM German Institute of SMEs (F-GISI) and FHM Center for Sustainable Governance (CSG), as a best practice Germany. Firstly, we have started with 'DOOST -SME Code' and we provide a SME code for SMEs to sift them with some conditions e.g. financial income and then introduce them for the next step. If some of the SMEs don't have enough abilities to move to the next step can get management consulting and training support from 'DOOST -SME Clinic' to improve their situation for the next ranking project. We have categorized the SMEs (have all conditions of the first step) based on customized Guter Mittelstand German Best Practice's categorization methods in 4 main groups: 1) Productive, 2) Service based, 3) Contactor, and 4) Knowledge based. Based on the 'DOOST -SME Code', we have 17 categories: (1)Energy, (2)Agriculture and environmental, (3)Food industry, (4)Health, social welfare and insurance, (5)Human Resources, (6)Dress and clothing, (7)Logistics, mobility and transportation, (8)Procurement, (9)Hotel and tourism, (10)Construction and manufacturing, (11)Education and research, (12)Telecommunication, (13)Digitalization, IoT and smartness, (14)Finance and investment, (15)Automotive and machinery, (16)Recycling and waste & wastewater management, and (17)Others. And then for the second executive step, we will use Guter Mittelstand method and after evaluation will get the results with the eleven factors: 1-Strategy, 2-Liquidity, 3-Risk assessment, 4-Leadership, 5-Market and customer, 6-Organization, 7-Corporate Culture, 8-Staff/Personal, 9-Production and Performance Process, 10-Procurement, 11-Innovation. DOOST SME RANKING (DSRM) Model is suitable ranking method for the Higher Educational Institution (HEIs) Development, based on Guter Mittelstand, Moocs and related progects as German Best Practice towards future readiness through the 5th wave theory and could be a movement to a new concept which is called SMEs 5.0  © 2022 IEEE.},

The SGIA covers not only technical but also policy and regulatory aspects by gathering key documents, information, data, best practices and project results from several relevant stakeholders with the specific aim to be replicated and adopted broadly. Exploiting a semantic engine, advanced AI algorithms and machine learning models, the SGIA automatically gathers all essential information from the documents within its database and provides enriched, easily searchable and browsable documents. Moreover, interlinked entities and relationship from documents are used to build the SGIA knowledge graph, which fosters an innovative way of exploring information based also on natural language queries. The SGIA platform is open to users from all over the world and now it is exploited and further developed in the framework of the Green Powered Future Mission, launched under the Mission Innovation second phase (MI2.0) and co-led by China, Italy and UK. In this paper the SGIA main functionalities will be presented and discussed together the recent developments available for users, such as automatic entity annotations on documents, access to definitions added by other users or through connections towards external databases, AI document summarizations, speech to text of multimedia contents and workspaces to support collaboration of users.  © 2022 AEIT.},

	abstract = {Practice and research collaborations in the disaster domain have the potential to improve emergency management practices while also advancing disaster science theory. However, they also pose challenges as practitioners and researchers each have their own culture, history, values, incentives, and processes that do not always facilitate collaboration. In this paper, we reflect on a 6-month practice and research collaboration, where researchers and practitioners worked together to craft a social media monitoring system for emergency managers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges we encountered in this project fall into two broad categories, job-related and timescale challenges. Using prior research on team science as a guide, we discuss several challenges we encountered in these two categories and show how our team sought to overcome them. We conclude with a set of best practices for improving practice and research collaborations. © 2022 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When organizations first harnessed information technology to solve business problems, automate processes and provide information, it could take many months, even years, to deploy an application. This situation changed two decades ago when Software-as-a-Service products, hosted in the cloud, became available. Today, technology has matured sufficiently, and it is possible to install an IT platform to support a global business process in a matter of weeks and to stitch multiple applications together into a reliable and agile architectural foundation. While legacy technology still poses a major problem, technology for new investments is no longer the bottleneck that it once was.This is likely one of the reasons why it is widely acknowledged that achieving digital transformation ambitions is less about technology deployment and more about the ability of the organization to adopt it and adapt to it, and to ultimately create real business value. But here is the conundrum: while the time to implement technology has been significantly compressed, achieving the organizational changes needed to reap benefits still require months and even years to achieve.A weakness in mainstream project management literature, especially when applied to technology-enabled business investments, is the assumption that the project is complete once the software is released, stabilized, and 'accepted' by the project's sponsor. Sometimes, a window of time is allocated to 'finish' the project; an after-action or lessons learned report is produced, the project team disbands, and victory is declared. When considering the success or failure of projects, discussions usually revolve around the budget, schedule, the software and its acceptance, but generally not about the changes that the organization has experienced as a result of improved processes or enhanced capabilities or whether the expected benefits were delivered. Despite recognizing that benefits come from organizational changes, project management is still premised around scope, resources and time. This can be because benefits have not yet happened; the nature of most IT projects is that benefits only emerge many weeks and months after 'go-live.' Victory is often declared prematurely.To promote the achievement of benefits from IT investments, the concept of Benefits Management was introduced in the 1990's. Its aim was to focus on what business benefits were expected to be delivered from the investment and to accelerate the realization of these benefits from harnessing the capabilities of technology. This was achieved by identifying the organizational changes necessary to release these benefits, as well as tracking the benefits realized throughout the entire initiation-to-realization cycle. It also advocated that expected benefits should be aligned to key strategic drivers.Since the original work on Benefits Management was undertaken, the context for IT investments has changed dramatically. The initial research was focused on improving the performance outcomes from large enterprise system investments; these systems had an internal organizational focus and took considerable time to implement. Back then, how systems were built was also different, due primarily to the constraints imposed by technology, development frameworks and dominant practices. Technologies like AI and analytics pose particular challenges for managing benefits in that it is difficult to specify them prior to technology deployment. Moreover, today, technology is a competitive necessity; it is shaping business models and customers expect to engage with an organization in a digital way; and systems can extend outside the organizational boundary to ecosystem partners. Speed, innovation, and agility are critical determinants of success in a digital-first world, fundamentally changing how an organization competes. All of these changes impact the nature of projects and how they are set up and run.Although benefits management is an established concept in the project management and technology literatures, it is not well-known as an organizational practice. In this paper, we revisit the benefits management concept, discuss some of the adoption barriers, and suggest a number of ways to adapt benefits management to digital transformation programs. © 2022 PICMET.},

	abstract = {Advance use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has reduced the need of human intervention within several tasks that are repetitive and rule-based. AI can have a great impact on the workforce of a project within the construction industry. Use of Machine learning techniques within the project process can be beneficial for a project manager to manage financial aspects and time scheduling both. The major problem that construction project managers face is ineffective tracking process, cost management process. This is the main reason, the AI-based solution are needed within construction sites. The aim of this research is to identify the role of AI in time management as well as cost management of a construction project in India. Intelligence robotics is a major AI-based tool that is used within construction project for marinating cost. Some challenges are also found within construction project that might have a huge effect within its implementation process such as cultural barriers, high-cost of maintenance and unavailability of similar input parameters in all projects. As per the findings, ANN, SVM, Regression and many other AI-based are effective Ai-based machine learning tools that are used within construction project to replace various time consuming process by modern technologies. Construction delays are the major effective factor for cost overrun and time overrun within a project. As per this research article, it has been found that, use of AI, especially ANN model can reduce the tendency of delay in construction projects and mismanagement of costs.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The start of the third decade of twenty-first century changed much of the dynamics both in the regional landscape of the innovations and for the work processes following them. The online platforms through which a lot of employments started to be generated crossed with the first applications of the artificial intelligence (AI). Thus the influx of models and processes related to the Future of Work expected at a predictable pace accelerated much more due to the initial pandemic crisis in the 2020 and the expected at the late 2021 emerging recession with further serious challenges for governments and economic operators to come. In this chapter, both the outlines of the regional levels of innovation and types/sectors of technological changes and the elements of the future of work, which occur as a follow-up will be identified. For the purpose, already a field research was performed in the frames of a project financed under the Bulgarian National Scientific Fund, and a lot of assumptions were discussed in the frames of an initiative on the multidisciplinary innovation. The objectives of this chapter are set out towards outlining the effects both of the innovative actions as a whole, and of some focused achievements for the AI applications over the processes by which the Future of Work vocations will be fulfilled. The understanding in the chapter is that the processes will be further accelerated not in the range of decades, but in less than several years. In the concept of the chapter is that the results of the acceleration of the Future of Work processes the working relations are and will be significantly demassified, and many industries, as well as the balance between them, will change. Those industries in the entertainment sector especially will be increasingly inferior, and the health and social care activities and sub-sectors may attract more work force on the other extreme. At the same time, the collection, management and use of process automation data as well as the mechanization of multiple productions and services will attract significant investment and replace human labour more and more. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Green finance can be referred to as financial investments made on sustainable projects and policies that focus on a sustainable economy. The procedures include promoting renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, water sanitation, industrial pollution control, transportation pollution control, reduction of deforestation, and carbon emissions, etc. Mainly, these green finance initiatives are carried out by private and public agents like business organizations, banks, international organizations, government organizations, etc. Green finance provides a financial solution to create a positive impact on society and leads to environmental development. In the age of artificial intelligence, all industries adopt AI technologies. In this research, we see the applications of the intelligent model to examine the green finance for ecological advancement with regard to artificial intelligence. Feasible transportation and energy proficiency and power transmission are two significant fields to be advanced and focused on minimizing the carbon impression in these industries. Renewable sources like solar energies for power generation and electric vehicles are to be researched and developed. This R&D requires a considerable fund supply, thus comes the green finance. Globally, green finance plays a vital role in creating a sustainable environment. In this research, for performing the green finance analysis, financial maximally filtered graph (FMFG) algorithm is implemented in different domains. The proposed algorithm is compared with the neural model and observed that the proposed model has obtained 98.85% of accuracy which is higher than the neural model.  © 2022 D. Hemanand et al.},

Additionally, the article indicates the main barriers to AI use in project management identified in the studied projects. In order to identify and systemise the range of AI use, the Conceptual Framework of Using AI in Project Management presented in literature is applied. Research results indicate that we are in the early stages of AI use in projects. The studied projects use AI mainly in project administration, i.e. to complete the following tasks: simple automation of routine activities, support, and, to a very limited extent, in the area of project management, i.e. in identifying anomalies and predicting the phenomena where the anomalies will occur. The research uses the case study method, where four projects were studied: an ERP system upgrade, an implementation of an IT system supporting high-bay warehouse management, an implementation of an IoT as a data-collection sensor platform and an E-learning platform implementation. The study was conducted between 2019 and 2021, and covered the entire project life cycle, including its three stages, i.e. preparation, implementation and operation.  © 2022 Bartosz Wachnik, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The financial services sector in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has seen significant growth, driven by digitalization and the rise of fintech firms. Financial services accounted for about 8% of the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at around 3 Trillion in 2021 [1]. While the GDP contracted slightly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall outlook over the next five years remains positive.To further boost this growth, and foster innovation, regulators across ASEAN are establishing foundations for open finance, as is clear from policies in Singapore [2], the Philippines [3], and Indonesia [4].The main objectives of the open finance framework are to offer integrated financial services by making customer experiences that are fully digital, frictionless, empathetic, and anticipatory to customer needs.Customers today are more digitally empowered, expect personalized service, and often maintain relationships with multiple retail banks. As such, Customer Experience (CX) management is a top priority for retail banks to ensure overall brand recall, customer loyalty, and growth.This however also poses a new challenge to incumbent banks, as they need to embark on complex digital transformation journeys to stay relevant and competitive with due consideration for costs and accrued benefits.In this context, this study explores the impact of cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and digital channels, collectively referred to as disruptive technologies, on customer experience management.It does so by critically examining existing literature on the evolution of digital technologies, their applications for customer engagement and the consequent impact on customer behaviours, and customer experience measures such as the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS). Based on the review, the study identifies opportunities for future research in the form of research questions, which include factors like experience quality, behaviour traits, and customer segmentation attributes that impact customer experience.The study contributes by providing insights to retail banks on key factors to consider while embarking on digital transformation projects to improve customer experience. While the study focuses on retail banking, its contributions could be beneficial to adjacent financial services like lending and insurance in ASEAN.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite growing enthusiasm, it is still difficult to successfully implement AI in corporate settings. The results of recent polls indicate that as many as 90% of AI projects fail to meet their objectives. There is a dearth of research into the outcomes of successful AI applications, which might serve as a treasure trove of information for businesses just starting out on their AI journey. Accordingly, the purpose or the goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of how artificial intelligence (AI) works, people, and processes may be effectively managed to produce results. Businesses' productivity has been boosted by the rise of e-commerce as a result of the information technology revolution and the emergence of the digital economy. Artificial intelligence and management information systems are increasingly being used to boost online sales. That technique is now widely used in industrial production and commercial operations. Businesses may save money, increase management efficiency, and increase sales and marketing revenues by using MIS systems and the internet to do business online. This research uses a change management-focused, whole-systems approach to learn more about how management information systems (MIS) and artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to bring in more money.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced lie detection systems from ethical and human resource (HR) management perspectives. I show how these AI enhancements transform lie detection, followed with analyses as to how the changes can lead to moral problems. Specifically, I examine how these applications of AI introduce human rights issues of fairness, mental privacy, and bias and outline the implications of these changes for HR management. The changes that AI is making to lie detection are altering the roles of human test administrators and human subjects, adding machine learning-based AI agents to the situation and establishing invasive data collection processes as well as introducing certain biases in results. I project that the potentials for pervasive and continuous lie detection initiatives (“truth machines”) are substantial, displacing human-centered efforts to establish trust and foster integrity in organizations. I argue that if it is possible for HR managers to do so, they should cease using technologically-based lie detection systems entirely and work to foster trust and accountability on a human scale. However, if these AI-enhanced technologies are put into place by organizations by law, agency mandate, or other compulsory measures, care should be taken that the impacts of the technologies on human rights and wellbeing are considered. The article explores how AI can displace the human agent in some aspects of lie detection and credibility assessment scenarios, expanding the prospects for inscrutable, “black box” processes and novel physiological constructs (such as “biomarkers of deceit”) that may increase the potential for such human rights concerns as fairness, mental privacy, and bias. Employee interactions with autonomous lie detection systems rather with than human beings who administer specific tests can reframe organizational processes and rules concerning the assessment of personal honesty and integrity. The dystopian projection of organizational life in which analyses and judgments of the honesty of one’s utterances are made automatically and in conjunction with one’s personal profile provides unsettling prospects for the autonomy of self-representation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Our paper investigates what forms the knowledge work design on a corporate level in the future. The future might be 2025, 2030, or 2035. The methodology includes interviews with researchers working with these issues in the Swedish telecommunication company Telia and the Norwegian telecommunication company Telenor. These companies make their living from understanding the future of work both on a corporate and societal level. The main finding is that AI and robotics will be more advanced, but the main changes will be management and organizational structure. The work will be done more as distance work and through virtual teams. The management and organization of work through the coronavirus have opened for more work done independent of time and the workplace and in virtual teams. There is also predicted a lack of professionals and all types of employees in the years to come, leading both to a competition for talent and increased importance in keeping the employed knowledge workers through internal career pipelines. AI and robotics will not reduce the need for professionals and employees. The steps will be taken one by one towards an integrated digitalization that makes new opportunities for collaboration, communication, and knowledge work. The fundamental knowledge worker will be using more of his working time on significant business issues. The skills needed are technical, information management, knowledge management, project management, collaboration, communication, rhetoric, virtual team, creativity, and green problem-solving skills. There is a corporate need for ethical, cultural, tolerating, and sexual awareness. We may summarize the needs as creative, sustainable, social and perception manipulation intelligence. The knowledge of the future will be complex, and the knowledge worker will handle multiple skills in different situations. The work of the future will be dominated by increasingly autonomous workers co-opting automated digital systems to create and capture value. The education might be revamped into a more task-focused education offered through the work life cycles. The revamping of education will also increase the overall employment and we will not experience the mass unemployment described in the literature as the result of AI, robotics, and digitalization. We have identified that the literature uses the unit occupation and not the unit tasks for the predicted higher unemployment and get a misinterpretation of negative consequences. The environmental issues and the climate crisis will be taken very seriously in the years to come and there will be a cooperation between the political economy and the corporate economy to do whatever is possible for sustainability in all internal and external processes to work greener and smarter. We will experience sustainability in action driven by a green leadership through a green strategy and green business models giving green services and products reusing as much as possible and using as few as possible resources to reduce the CO2 gases. This study concludes that there will be many small positive corporate and societal steps for each year towards 2030, improving the way of living and working together with environmental improvements. The reconstruction of the middle class is also emerging — neither a perfect nor an imperfect world. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.},

In the urban web coexist many types of buildings of different historical periods e.g. Byzantine (medieval) temples, neoclassical (art nouveau, art deco), apartment buildings (interwar and postwar buildings), which have been built with different materials and styles. Nevertheless, the “type” of such buildings (e.g. period-based, neoclassical, interwar and postwar buildings) is a repetitive recognizable organizational structure, which is perceived as part of a class of repetitive objects characterized by their common morphological features. Until nowadays, the recognition of the “type” was the result of collective mental mechanisms, which society processed through everyday construction experience. Today, the type pre-exists in the mind of the culture heritage (CH) researchers (architects, archaeologists, historians of art etc.) as a result of their special education. This paper focuses on the typological approach through the classification of data using methods of the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically Deep Learning. It is a process that may: a) lead to the comparative evaluation of the common and repetitive elements of different projects with architectural criteria, b) enable the huge classification of data in a short period of time, c) make possible the digital management of the available CH building stock and d) export useful conclusions that will contribute to the further study of the CH data in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Telecom operators and ICT companies have accepted the challenge to develop and integrate mobile localization technologies, powered by AI algorithms and machine-learning techniques, which will exploit the location information while, at the same time, preserve end-users’ privacy. The use of these technologies will enhance location-based communication and network management techniques as well as mobility and radio resource management. In this paper, we present the ambition coming from the framework of the LOCUS EU-funded project [1]. LOCUS aims to design and implement an innovative location management layered platform which will be able to improve localization accuracy, taking into consideration localization security and privacy concerns, to extend localization with physical analytics and finally to extract value out from the combined interaction of localization and analytics, while guaranteeing users’ privacy. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper explores the possibility of using tools and algorithms from the fields of machine learning and computational linguistics to assist the project manager in prospectively accurate estimation of resources in the project planning phase using the information from quality management systems and older completed projects. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic analysis of the literature and research projects was carried out to survey the current application areas of NLP. For this purpose, a search in scientific databases such as GEPRIS, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink was carried out in May 2021 for the observation period from 2012 to 2021. Findings – The potential of NLP in combination with machine learning in the form of an AI workflow as a support for project management concerning competence-based resource planning in software development projects has been overlooked. Originality/value – This is a systematic approach for competency-based project planning of industrial projects, which uses modern IT-based solutions from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for support. By querying and analyzing information from quality management systems of the company regarding project roles, competencies of team members, etc. and combining and comparing this information with the company's already completed projects, conclusions can be drawn regarding future projects. © 2022 Universidade do Minho.

	abstract = {According to “Huang’s law”, Artificial intelligence (AI)-related hardware increases in power 4–10 times per year. AI can benefit various stages of real estate development, from planning and construction to occupation and demolition. However, Hong Kong’s legal system is currently behind when it comes to technological abilities, while the field of AI safety in built environments is still in its infancy. Negligent design and production processes, irresponsible data management, questionable deployment, algorithm training, sensor design and/or manufacture, unforeseen consequences from multiple data inputs, and erroneous AI operation based on sensor or remote data can all lead to accidents. Yet, determining how legal rules should apply to liability for losses caused by AI systems takes time. Traditional product liability laws can apply for some systems, meaning that the manufacturer will bear responsibility for a malfunctioning part. That said, more complex cases will undoubtedly have to come before the courts to determine whether something unsafe should be the manufacturer’s fault or the individual’s fault, as well as who should receive the subsequent financial and/or non-financial compensation, etc. Since AI adoption has an inevitable relationship with safety concerns, this project intends to shed light on responsible AI development and usage, with a specific focus on AI safety laws, policies, and people’s perceptions. We will conduct a systematic literature review via the PRISMA approach to study the academic perspectives of AI safety policies and laws and data-mining publicly available content on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to study societal concerns about AI safety in built environments. We will then research court cases and laws related to AI safety in 61 jurisdictions, in addition to policies that have been implemented globally. Two case studies on AI suppliers that sell AI hardware and software to users of built environment will also be included. Another two case studies will be conducted on built environment companies (a contractor and Hong Kong International Airport) that use AI safety tools. The results obtained from social media, court cases, legislation, and policies will be discussed with local and international experts via a workshop, then released to the public to provide the international community and Hong Kong with unique policy and legal orientations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {With the development of science and technology, more and more fields have begun to use AI to provide convenient services for humans. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a new technology that uses human thinking to respond accordingly through computers and robots to assist human beings. Action recognition is an important research project that needs to be broken through in many industries, such as security system, martial arts instruction, and dance training. This paper aims to study a method for action recognition using AI technology and to build a sports training management information system. In this paper, a recognition model and related algorithms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) are proposed, and an intelligent sports training management information system is constructed. The system and the model are tested, the action recognition effect of 60 athletes in a university is tested, and the comparison with the traditional recognition algorithm is carried out. The results show that the CNN recognition accuracy test results used in this paper are generally more than 90%, while the traditional recognition accuracy rate is only about 75%, and the highest is not more than 86%; the training management information system of this paper takes about 15.7 s, and the maximum time is not more than 10 s, while the traditional recognition system takes about 15.7 s, which is about twice the time of the system in this paper. Therefore, it shows that the CNN recognition method in this paper has a significantly better effect on the recognition of athletes' movements, and the sports training management information system constructed in this paper is less time-consuming and faster and has certain feasibility.  © 2022 Dali Cheng et al.},

Public procurement particularly suffers of poor digitalization with ineffective processes and low adoption of Green Public Procurement (GPP) mainly due to the lack of digital and automated data-driven tools for tender evaluation. Leveraging DTs as virtual Prototypes (DTPs) could help to overcome the current discrete project performances evaluation and enable a systemic one, exploitable for bids evaluation besides performance and sustainability optimization. The research adopts a PLM view to define a methodology aimed at developing DTPs starting from the bidding BIM models. The main objective is to integrate several DTPs and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in the aim automatizing MEAT (Most Economic Advantageous Tender) procedure and promote GPP adoption, providing an optimal and more objective data-driven awarding system and criteria weighting. Three crucial objectives should be accomplished: (i) the definition of a replicable methodology to develop the DTPs, (ii) the definition of their informative structure and (iii) the re-engineering of tender processes to bring full digitalization and automation. This could enable more effective decisions and performance optimization, bids objective evaluation, tendering procedure streamlining, transparency and sustainability enhancement. The awarded DTP, as a truthful “As-built” developed accordingly to defined information guidelines, must be exploited as the basis for valuable DTIs to manage the whole lifecycle, optimizing DTs development costs together with operational and maintenance costs. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Much research is conducted on the importance of success factors. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by using artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), to analyse success factors through data from construction projects. Previously conducted studies have explored the use of AI to predict project success and identify important success factors in projects; however, to the extent of the authors’ knowledge, no studies have implemented the same method as this study. This study conducts quantitative analysis on a sample of 160 Norwegian construction projects, with data obtained from a detailed questionnaire delivered to relevant project team members. The method utilises ML through a Random Forest Classifier (RFC). The findings obtained from the analysis show that it is possible to use AI and ML on a limited dataset. Furthermore, the findings show that it is possible to identify the most important success factors for the projects in question with the developed model. The findings suggest that a group of selected processes is more important than others to achieve success. The identified success factors support the theoretically acknowledged importance of thorough and early planning and analysis, complexity throughout the project, leadership involvement, and processes supporting project success. © 2022 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Management of chronic wounds in healthcare disciplines is a huge financial burden on healthcare systems around the world. An estimated 1.5-2 million patients in Europe alone suffer from acute or chronic wounds at a given time. The mental and societal burden of living with a chronic wound is immense. Many studies have shown that treatment of these wounds conservatively (without surgery) is one of the major contributing factors to the cost, with wound dressings being a significant impactr. Data from the NHS shows that managing wounds properly such as choosing the appropriate dressing for the right wound and continuous appropriate treatment can significantly increase healing and reduce healthcare spending. Funded by the National Institute of Health Research and NHS England the AI in Health and Care Award Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) and NHS AI Lab supported AI technologies across the spectrum of development, from initial feasibility to evaluation within clinical pathways in the NHS and social care settings, to the point that they could be nationally commissioned. In this paper, the findings of a phase 1, project a feasibility study are introduced for discussion and shared learning about an artificial intelligence-based technology which aims in phase 2 to predict the development of hard to heal wounds and their rates of healing and produce recommendations for clinicians dealing with wound care. Woubot® will evaluate the risks of different wound treatments and predict and monitor the progression of wounds. Considering national guidelines on treatment as well as data available, improvements in practice will be recommended, and tailored treatment plans will be suggested for individual patients. Early analysis of patient data (combined electronic clinical records containing demographic, historical, laboratory tests, intervention details etc.) was completed over a 12-month period. The impact of biological factors affecting wound healing suggested that changes in clinical practice such as carrying out a blood test to detect for example vitamin B12 levels and other circulatory factors could significantly improve wound healing rates. The findings suggest that once detected either simple lifestyle changes (diet) or a clinical intervention e.g., B12 injections may result in improved healing. Initial assessments show the monetized benefits of using Woubot® have been predicted to be around £35 million over a period of 10 years, which is a substantial development in the future of wound management. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain, AI and robotics are the top three disruptive technologies that are likely to consume a major share of the supply chain (SC) technology investments in this decade. As in the past, each technology comes with inherent elements that have the potential to unlock governance and business capabilities, but not all the technological elements/ features of each are equally facilitative to the objectives of an organization. However, due to the lack of understanding of the capabilities of a technology in a specific context, governments and organizations make major investments in technologies that then result in suboptimal return on investment (ROI). This research study identifies the most facilitative features of the blockchain technologies and demonstrate their differential effects on achieving specific outcomes. Our case-based research identifies how each BCT feature contributes to specific performance benefits. Particularly this study focuses on two different use cases to show how transparency, immutability, smart contracts and consensus enablement in blockchain-based systems can help enforce Covid-19 rules and assure food safety. Finally, this research study has concluded that matching the features of a technology, specifically blockchains to the expected project outcomes can increase adoption of the technology with better return on technology investment.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Project planning starts with the project initiation phase in which high-level project objectives, commitments, requirements, risks etc. are identified. Typically, the Project Manager involves multiple stakeholders such as HR, Admin, Infrastructure team for the initiation phase to understand and outline the requirements for each group. Current industry practice largely relies on the project manager's experience to carry out the project initiation activities keeping in view the customer context and commitments made. Many times, important information is missed during the transfer of information from sales to delivery resulting in not meeting customer expectations and delivery slippages. Here we propose an AI-enabled approach to automatically extract and classify project initiation relevant information from Request For Proposal (RFP) response document using a combination of NLP and ML-based techniques. The approach is validated with real life RFP response documents for five customers. Overall, 76% accuracy was observed for question classification and 41% information was found to be relevant for project initiation from the RFP response documents. In this paper, we share details of our approach, its implementation, early results, and lessons learnt.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread advancements in and envisioned uses for artificial intelligence (AI), few examples of successfully implemented AI innovations exist in primary care (PC) settings. Objectives To identify priority areas for AI and PC in Ontario, Canada. Methods A collaborative consultation event engaged multiple stakeholders in a nominal group technique process to generate, discuss and rank ideas for how AI can support Ontario PC. Results The consultation process produced nine ranked priorities: (1) preventative care and risk profiling, (2) patient self-management of condition(s), (3) management and synthesis of information, (4) improved communication between PC and AI stakeholders, (5) data sharing and interoperability, (6-tie) clinical decision support, (6-tie) administrative staff support, (8) practitioner clerical and routine task support and (9) increased mental healthcare capacity and support. Themes emerging from small group discussions about barriers, implementation issues and resources needed to support the priorities included: equity and the digital divide; system capacity and culture; data availability and quality; legal and ethical issues; user-centred design; patient-centredness; and proper evaluation of AI-driven tool implementation. Discussion Findings provide guidance for future work on AI and PC. There are immediate opportunities to use existing resources to develop and test AI for priority areas at the patient, provider and system level. For larger scale, sustainable innovations, there is a need for longer-term projects that lay foundations around data and interdisciplinary work. Conclusion Study findings can be used to inform future research and development of AI for PC, and to guide resource planning and allocation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

	abstract = {The importance of network data analytics using advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has been very well realized by the Telco industry and has resulted in the introduction of a dedicated Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the 5G service-based architecture in order to address the issues of integrating analytics into the network. The standardization of NWDAF by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) would enable third-party data analytics service providers to develop and provide AI-driven data analytics services to the Mobile Network Operators. The next-generation Radio Access Networks would require advanced analytics to drive closed-loop self-organizing network functions that are targeted to cognitively enhance network ef ciency and reduce the operational and capital costs of network operators. The existing solutions in this domain rely on conventional ML approaches that require the training data to be accumulated on a single data center. The concerns in this area would be the network overload and the privacy of the network operators that are sharing huge volumes of sensitive network data to the third-party Network Data Analytics Services (NDAS) executing over edge cloud infrastructures, perhaps even operated by some other players. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Federated Learning based approach to train ML models for cognitive network management of future mobile networks that can enable network operators to get data analytics services by collaboratively building a shared learning model while retaining their critical data locally within their trusted domains. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the process of continuous urbanization construction, the construction scale of urban landscaping projects is getting larger. At the same time, the design and the maintenance of the management is becoming more important. Recently, the rocketing development of the ternary world of many people, machines, and things has triggered the generation of multisource fusion data and the development of artificial intelligence technology, and the world has entered the era of multisource big data intelligence. Multisource data refer to the fusion of multiple types of data with effective characteristic information, which has richer, more comprehensive, more detailed, and more effective information than a single data source, and can provide high-quality data sources for various complex problems. Therefore, more effective data can be provided for the definition of urban fringe areas. From the moment Google's AlphaGo defeated Go world champion Li Shishi, the chess game has been occupied by AI, setting off an upsurge in the study, research, and application of AI technology. Colleges and universities around the world have followed suit and set up AI-related majors. Deep learning is one of the cutting-edge technologies in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a method to solve complex real-life problems by extracting effective information from the data and mining key features on the basis of a large amount of learning and computing data.  © 2022 Lijuan Zhu.},

Overall goal of this paper is to discuss about an approach to increase the success of the software projects through Artificial Intelligence. Standard governance standards are analyzed to understand the impact on software project success rates. Enterprise governance is a subset of IT governance that aids in the management of information technology resources. COBIT is a widely used methodology for developing effective enterprise IT governance. ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) stated implementation solution currently uses a sequentially ordered approach, which has raised issues. Several challenges have arisen as a result of top management's lack of commitment and misplaced solutions. Limitation on this investigation is the customized and confidential governance pattern used across various organization, hence there are very limited real time data for end-to-end analysis. Nonetheless, in combination with the agile project management paradigm, new project life-cycle solutions have evolved. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an important element to address the increasing demand for machine learning systems. Artificial neural network (ANN) method is highly useful to arrive at best possible solution to improve the project success. This study found that ANN with Balance Score Card was exceptionally effective in providing the optimal solution to increase the project success rates.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decision-making and forecasting capabilities of algorithmic systems have helped organizations improve work productivity and business performance. Specifically, AI-enabled information systems (IS) are increasingly being used to track employee's work hours and automate their work shifts in retail and service industries including hospitality, leisure, and health services. For example, companies such Kronos, Zoho and Deputy specialize in workforce management software programs that utilize AI technologies to match employer's staffing needs for labor to at-the-moment customer demand. Software programs do not only fine-tune and optimize scheduling decisions but also send automatic updates to employees about their shift changes (Loggins, 2020). According to a report from the Reportlinker.com (2022), the global market of cloud-based work scheduling software is estimated to grow by over 4 billion dollars during the forecast period of 2022 to 2026. With the increasing relevance of algorithmic systems in workforce scheduling and management, it is critical to understand their impact on employees' work experiences and effectiveness. Specifically, past research has indicated that the use of algorithmic systems in the workplace can lead to several ramifications including discrimination, surveillance, manipulation, disempowerment of employees, precarity, and stress (e.g., Kellogg et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there remains an equivocal understanding of why employees would have those negative experiences with the deployment of algorithmic systems and what organizations could do to mitigate those negative experiences effectively. In this research, we center on investigating the effects of employees' perceptions of transparency about work scheduling AI software on their job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment. According to a theory of psychological ownership in organizations (Pierce et al., 2001), individuals have an innate motive to be in control and to be efficient and effectant (Pierce et al., 2003). Based on this core premise, the present study suggests that when the inner workings of work management AI software are unclear to employees, the compliance to automated work schedules can negatively affect employees' perceptions of job autonomy and job-based psychological ownership, that could further decrease employees' job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment. In contrast, when employees are provided with an explanation about why and how work management AI software programs are deployed to manage their work shifts, they are likely to perceive such programs as more transparent and less opaque. As a result, employees are likely to experience freedom and flexibility in controlling their own work schedules with the use of those programs, and such work experiences can enhance job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The present research is intended to extend prior research on AI-related work design. A close examination of algorithmic transparency from a psychological ownership lens can help to shed light onto both positive and negative effects of AI-related work management on employees' work outcomes and psychological experiences. Study results from this research can also help to inform HR managers, supervisors, and stakeholders at organizations of the importance of building and using work management AI software in ways that can facilitate transparency and ensure worker well-being and a committed workforce. © 2022 28th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2022.

	abstract = {Diagnostic data logs generated by systems components represent the main source of information about the system run-time behavior. However, as faults typically lead to multiple reported errors that propagate to other components, the analysts’ work is hardened by digging in cascading diagnostic messages. Root cause analysis can help to pinpoint faults from the failures occurred during system operation but it is unpractical for complex systems, especially in the context of Industry 4.0 and Railway domains, where smart control devices continuously generate high amount of logs. The AID4TRAIN project aims to improve root cause analysis in both Industry 4.0 and Railway domains leveraging AI techniques to automatically infer a fault model of the target system from historical diagnostic data, which can be integrated with the system experts knowledge. The resulting model is then leveraged to create log filtering rules to be applied on previously unseen diagnostic data to identify the root cause of the occurred problem. This paper introduces the AID4TRAIN framework and its implementation at the current project stage. Further, a preliminary case study in the railway domain is presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The 'Smart Urban Mobility Management' (S.U.M.Ma) Project is designed in this direction. The pilot project, which takes place into the Municipality of Artena, aims to design and test highly innovative tools such as drones, H-D (High Definition) smart cameras, IoT (Internet of Things) Sensors on 5G network and AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools, by integrating environmental datasets, information systems and local databases and taking into account the mobility of traffic flows, the energy efficiency and the control of environmental parameters. In this paper, the general structure of the system architecture has been presented, and the traffic model of the Municipality of Artena has been developed and preliminarily calibrated, with 'surrogate' flows. Furthermore, the algorithms for the post-processing of the traffic flows and real-time updating of the traffic model have been introduced. Although the project is still in the closing phase, the results obtained so far show that the proposed system is easily replicable in other Municipalities and it could be an effective tool for the increasingly green and smart management of modern communities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Our aim in this research is to classify the cognitive behavior of project managers in the MENA region quantitatively to be able to use this classification for a better recruitment result using the AI tools. The philosophy of the research is a realism one and the MENA region is chosen due to its increasing need to plan and implement developing projects. The conclusion of this study reveals the existence of four basic project manager's cognitive behavioral styles: the innovative, risk-averse, specialized, and experiential styles. The reliability of the measurement is tested by Cronbach 'alpha and the classification of items of the survey is implemented using the EFA and CFA.

	abstract = {In order to explore the application of AI technology in construction management system modeling, the author proposed the application of a deep learning-based AI technology in construction management system modeling. The 3 D reconstruction deep learning model is first introduced, and then the model idea of the construction progress reliability control system is designed based on BIM (building information model). Second, the construction process of the 4dbim model is described, and the construction method is introduced. The construction of the model provides data information for the construction schedule reliability control system. Finally, the three functional modules of progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction are realized by combining the S-curve comparison method, and the work of the system is described through case simulation. The early warning result is from June 7 to June 11, the progress deviation is between (-2%, 2%), and the progress is basically controlled. On June 13, the planned workload was 81.099%, and the actual cumulative workload was 7.099%, which was 4% less than the planned workload. The project progress was out of date, so it needs to be closely tracked. On June 15, the planned workload was 85.511%, and the actual cumulative workload was 80.899%, 4.5% less than the planned workload. The forecast result is the line forecast of the actual cumulative completion percentage on June 17. After calculation, the forecast result on June 17 is 84.311%. The progress deviation on June 17 was 5.21%. If no timely delay is taken on June 15, the delay will get worse. In addition, the system can predict the completion period of the project. When the actual percentage of cumulative completion is greater than or equal to 100%, it indicates that the project has been completed. Therefore, we can calculate the completion period of the three-storey project, and the construction period is about June 29 or 30. When the simulation can be carried out, the simulation number is set as 1000 times, the completion probability of the project is only 40%, and the completion probability is not too high. Artificial intelligence technology can realize progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction. This system model prepares for software development and is conducive to improving the progress reliability control level of construction enterprises. Starting from the schedule planning subsystem and the schedule control subsystem, this paper studies the application of the artificial intelligence technology based on deep learning in the modeling of a building construction management system. The results show that this technology can effectively improve the efficiency of the building construction schedule management. Compared with the existing management methods, it shows great advantages in terms of operating costs and ease of use. It also promotes the application of artificial intelligence technology in the construction phase. © 2022 Hongbo Wang and Yan Hu.},

	abstract = {Supporting network intelligence is one of the main goals of 6G core networks. Network intelligence can provide a self-driving network that optimizes and adjusts itself with the least amount of human interaction. Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is an approach that can be combined with 6G core networks to provide automation. The IBN concept provides a closed-loop control architecture that is able to adapt to the status of the network by monitoring data from network functions. Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) is proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to collect monitoring data from multiple network functions. This paper proposes an architecture that combines the NWDAF with the IBN concept to merge it with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze the monitoring data. The proposed scheme creates a system that will be able to provide automatic verification and optimization for the 6G core networks.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Existing 3D reconstruction algorithms frequently result in large there may be holes, distortions, or hazy regions in remade 3D models, but AI-based 3D remaking strategies regularly reestablish straightforward isolated parts and portray them as 3D boxes. Accordingly, these algorithmic systems are generally not sufficient for certifiable use. The primary objective of this paper is to apply the creation ill-disposed network strategy to 3D recreation works on the nature of the underlying 3D recreation model via preparing a generative ill-disposed network model to a joined state. As solo examples, just recently noticed 2D pictures are required, with no dependence on earlier information on the 3D hidden shape or reference insights. Test results show that this algorithmic structure outflanks present status of-the-workmanship 3D reproduction approaches on an average 3D recreation test set. On the common 3D remaking test set, exploratory outcomes uncover that this algorithmic structure beats the current cutting edge 3D reproduction techniques.  © 2022 Lixiang Wang.},

	abstract = {The operation of large US Department of Energy (DOE) research facilities, like the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, results in the collection of complex multi-dimensional scientific datasets, both experimental and model-generated. In the future, it is envisioned that integrated data analysis coupled with large-scale high performance computing (HPC) simulations will be used to improve experimental planning and operation. Practically, massive data sets from these simulations provide the physics basis for generation of both reduced semi-analytic and machine-learning-based models. Storage of both HPC simulation datasets (generated from US DOE leadership computing facilities) and experimental datasets presents significant challenges. In this paper, we present a vision for a DOE-wide data management workflow that integrates US DOE fusion facilities with leadership computing facilities. Data persistence and long-term availability beyond the length of allocated projects is essential, particularly for verification and recalibration of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models. Because these data sets are often generated and shared among hundreds of users across multiple leadership computing facility centers, they would benefit from cross-platform accessibility, persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, or digital object identifier), and provenance tracking. The ability to handle different data access patterns suggests that a combination of low cost, high latency (e.g. for storing ML training sets) and high cost, low latency systems (e.g. for real-time, integrated machine control feedback) may be needed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The construction industry has become more digital and the traditional methods of construction activities are gradually becoming outdated. In this era of digital construction, various information and communication technologies have been developed and deployed to the site for the management and control of construction activities including cost management. Irrespective of the benefits of adopting these technologies, most of them are still not readily accepted for use for construction management. This study articulated Seven (7) recent technologies driving the industry and evaluated their acceptance for cost management of construction projects. The technologies include mobile technology, Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Equipment (Drones and Robotics), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Predictive Analytics (PA). Data was gathered using a restructured questionnaire and technology acceptance model analysis was performed to identify which of the technologies have higher acceptance for cost management based on the criteria of availability, affordability, frequency of use, usefulness for cost management, and acceptance in the industry. Test statistics using Spearman's correlations and Kendall's correlations for each of the technologies and Spearman's Correlations of Technology acceptance with other variables in the TAM Model were performed. The results showed that mobile technology has higher correlation values than other technologies, and therefore has a higher acceptance for cost management. Kendall's coefficient of concordance values and Spearman's correlation values for Mobile technology were all above 0.6 which indicates a high level of agreement among the raters and strong relationships between the compared TAM variables. © 2022 International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction.

	abstract = {The major challenge in metro cities is to handle the vehicle traffic as well as pedestrian traffic at major locations. Over a day nearly 20% time is spend in our work or personal time to over come the delay at traffic to reach the destination. Traffic management systems have been the subject of much study, but because of the blending of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, research on intelligent traffic monitoring is currently ongoing (AI). By integrating these technologies, we can improve decision-making processes and promote urban development. The management of urban and highway traffic is the primary emphasis of the available traffic prediction techniques, and there are few studies that have concentrated on collector roads and closed campuses. Furthermore, when the consumers are not using any smart gadgets, it is difficult to reach out to the public and create active relationships to help them make decisions. In order to gather, analyse, and store real-time traffic data for such a situation, this study suggests an IoT-based system paradigm. The goal is to increase mobility by using roadside messaging devices to provide real-time traffic reports on traffic congestion and unexpected traffic events. These time-saving alerts will benefit residents, particularly during rush hour. Also disseminated by the system are the administrative authorities' traffic updates. The results of the trials demonstrate high accuracy in vehicle recognition and a low relative error in road occupancy prediction. A prototype is used to assess the viability of the model. The research project, which is financed by Omani, is looking at Real-Time Feedback for Adaptive Traffic Signals.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the recent decade, the amount of digital information recorded in electronic health records (EHRs) has increased dramatically. EHRs are no longer used to store basic patient information and administrative activities, but they can now store a wide range of data, from the patient's medical history to images. The issue currently is not so much gathering data as it is analyzing it, that is, converting data into knowledge, conclusions, and actions. The use of innovative technology instruments, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to support medical inter-disciplinary collaboration among different teams, geographically distributed in the network, extracting useful information from EHRs, and integrating data from various data sources is a crucial, but still difficult task. SIMPATICO 3D (Sistema Informativo Medico PATologIe COmplesse) is a system that assists scientists and clinicians by offering tools for managing, organizing, analyzing, and disseminating medical data. The project SIMPATICO 3D originates from a collaboration between the software house eway Enterprise Business Solutions, the DIMES Department of the University of Calabria and the DMSC Department of the University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro and it has been selected for funding under the FESR 2014/2020.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The practice of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being promoted by technology developers. However, its adoption rate is still reported as low in the construction industry due to a lack of expertise and the limited reliable applications for AI technology. Hence, this paper aims to present the detailed outcome of experimentations evaluating the applicability and the performance of AI object detection algorithms for construction modular object detection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a thorough evaluation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection, including the faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster RCNN) and single shot multi-box detector (SSD). Two types of metrics are also presented; first, the average recall and mean average precision by image pixels; second, the recall and precision by counting. To conduct the experiments using the selected algorithms, four infrastructure and building construction sites are chosen to collect the required data, including a total of 990 images of three different but common modular objects, including modular panels, safety barricades and site fences. Findings: The results of the comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms show that the performance of faster RCNN and SSD depends on the context that detection occurs. Indeed, surrounding objects and the backgrounds of the objects affect the level of accuracy obtained from the AI analysis and may particularly effect precision and recall. The analysis of loss lines shows that the loss lines for selected objects depend on both their geometry and the image background. The results on selected objects show that faster RCNN offers higher accuracy than SSD for detection of selected objects. Research limitations/implications: The results show that modular object detection is crucial in construction for the achievement of the required information for project quality and safety objectives. The detection process can significantly improve monitoring object installation progress in an accurate and machine-based manner avoiding human errors. The results of this paper are limited to three construction sites, but future investigations can cover more tasks or objects from different construction sites in a fully automated manner. Originality/value: This paper’s originality lies in offering new AI applications in modular construction, using a large first-hand data set collected from three construction sites. Furthermore, the paper presents the scientific evaluation results of implementing recent object detection algorithms across a set of extended metrics using the original training and validation data sets to improve the generalisability of the experimentation. This paper also provides the practitioners and scholars with a workflow on AI applications in the modular context and the first-hand referencing data. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The reasons for this are manifold and range from not understanding use cases, not enough trained employees, to too little data. This article presents a successful design-oriented case study at a medium-sized company, where the described reasons are present. In this study, future demand forecasts are generated based on historical demand data for products at a material number level using a gradient boosting machine (GBM). An improvement of 15% on the status quo (i.e. based on the root mean squared error) could be achieved with rather simple techniques. Hence, the motivation, the method, and the first results are presented. Concluding challenges, from which practical users should derive learning experiences and impulses for their own projects, are addressed. © 2022 17th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik, WI 2022.

Therefore, this research seeks to explore AI uses and its benefits on the UK construction industry. Given the new and unexplored nature of the research problem, a qualitative case study research methodology was adopted. Construction projects, which have adopted some of the AI forms all around the UK, are investigated extracting the use of the technology and how processes within the construction industry can benefit from the adoption of AI. Developing an AI system can benefit the construction industry in terms of the planning process, organizations have implemented AI systems to accomplish tasks such as tunnel inspections, safety hazard identifying, and risk management. These implementations have proved to be successful and efficient in improving production within the organizations. This paper highlights the key uses and benefits of AI-based systems within the construction industry. The business model was developed based on current work practices with AI and without AI.

In healthcare, such an application makes medical instruments more successful by allowing patient health tracking in real time to capture patient data and minimize human error. In this manner, patient health surveillance is tracked over the IoT. Health IoT is the solution for integrated real-time surveillance of people with psychiatric disabilities at low costs and traffic between the results of patients and the diagnosis of diseases. We have seen the health tracking system that gathers simple parameters including heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and growth parameters up to now. We address in this study the control of the brain waves of the patient and the real-time detection of patient condition. We use mobile headset that deals with EEG technology to gather data from brain signals. The performance effect indicates the pattern of the waveform. The key objective is to provide optimized benefit to patients with mental disabilities in this proposed project by collecting data from brain signals with 24 channels. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {In today's world the information should be available at any time and any place. From the user's point of view, these requirements are mandatory even if the traffic is growing and the user's experience is hyper-contextualized., personalized and mostly dynamic. From an application services provider point of view, in software defined networks and cloud intelligent managed data rooms, the networking architecture is required to combine central management and network residency. To provide the above mentioned services, the telecommunications networks have to provide maximum flexibility. The same mandatory functionality is required for clustered architectures used in cloud service providers' data rooms. This maximum resilience must involve two aspects: flexibility seen as accepting many different possible configurations and flexibility as the required time for these configurations to be applied to equipment in order to take effect. A possible solution to these requirements, is to separates the data plane forwarding the traffic from the control plane who's taking the decisions based on different criteria. In the meantime the control plane evolves and becomes a complete centralized management solution. This paper presents two new ideas and their implementation in an operational test data room. The first one consist of a data processing technique and algorithm that leads to dynamic resource allocation. The second implementation has as a main focus on the artificial intelligence AI-based trend prediction module that takes the decisions for the resources allocation algorithm.

	abstract = {The design of technology assessment tools is an important Knowledge Management endeavour. Technology assessment is a subject where consensus is far from being achieved. Any project intended to create a technology assessment tool is expected to generate a lot of discussion or criticism. Among the most critical kinds of technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a highly polemic kind of technology. Its impacts are important and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the technology evolves quickly and so do the attitudes toward that technology. Therefore, business owners intending to produce an AI assessment tool should expect extensive discussion of different points of view, but also support the continuation of the discussion throughout time and with different stakeholders. Surprisingly, technology assessment tools developed by business owners have been particularly neglected in the coalescent discussion about AI documentation, not to mention the support to create those tools. To foster a continuous innovation flow, business owners should pay particular attention to how discussions are captured. This paper explores the foundations of knowledge management initiatives to support the design of an artificial intelligence assessment tool at the business owner, in a process that supports continuous discussion and innovation. This article also suggests project aspects and supporting document structure. Copyright © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

Earth science research has benefited from these advancements and continues to do so. However, entry-level AI/ML projects frequently have a significant level of complexity that prevents them from being realized. Furthermore, HPC workflows oftentimes require specialized knowledge for the installation and management of software dependencies. Our group has been working on closing this gap, particularly focused in remotely sensed applications, by leveraging high performance computing containers to make code portable across environments. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a set of containers to both speed up and optimize the development of remotely sensed data applications. These containers have been made publicly available for the use of the science community and include common AI/ML frameworks and hardware acceleration libraries. Here we present several use cases and experiments of how containers can be leveraged to speed up the development and deployment of AI/ML software and some examples of containerized applications performance. © 2022 IEEE.},

We discovered 20 governance concepts, some of which are relevant to more than one of the three stages. Our analysis highlights AI governance as a complex process that involves multiple activities and stakeholders. As development projects are unique, the governance requirements and processes also vary.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant challenges to supply chains and some organizations turned to AI projects to meet these challenges. AI projects can entail many forms of complexity and extant research is only beginning to explore how to manage them successfully. Projects with pandemic-induced urgency likewise require careful management attention, especially when coupled with complexity. In this paper, we examine the case of AISys, an AI-based system designed and built for CityPort, a multimodal port in North America, during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. AISys aimed to identify cargo critical to addressing the pandemic. We propose a theoretical framework based on team-level theories of stress and coping to understand the role of project stressors urgency and complexity in the successful management of this AI project, and how a project team used coping resources and employed specific coping strategies to overcome these stressors. Preliminary results support our theoretical framework. © 2022 28th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

It enables remote monitoring, management, and control of devices and the generation of fresh and actionable insight from huge quantities of real-time data. Real-time noise and emissions monitoring of vehicles remain indispensable in a smart city context. Effective management and control of noise and emissions of vehicles on the road are necessary and possible through analyzing lots of sensor data in real-time to take an actionable insight. To contribute to this, as part of an ongoing effort of the European Union project called 'NEMO: Noise and Emissions Monitoring and Radical Mitigation', in this paper, we present the design and development of an IoT-based real-time noise and emissions monitoring system for vehicles in a smart city context. Real-world sensor data of the vehicles in some European cities are collected during the pilot tests. We have developed a complete application for infrastructure managers and analysts to monitor the sensor data related to noise and emissions of vehicles in real-time. The data of the individual road vehicles and trains in selected EU cities and from trains on a track in the Netherlands are collected in the cloud and analyzed with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for classification such as high emitter, medium emitter, and normal emitters. We present the development of a complete software solution that can be integrated with existing intelligent transportation systems in smart cities. Finally, we report the initial vehicle classification results from the Rotterdam (Netherlands) pilot test as a representative example for the NEMO monitoring system. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that facilitates the proliferation of different devices such as sensors and Radio Frequency Identification (RFIDs) for real-time applications such as healthcare and sustainable cities. The growing popularity of IoT opens up new possibilities, and one of the most notable applications is related to the evolving sustainable city paradigm. A sustainable city is normally designed in such a way to consider the environmental impact and a social, economic, and resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same, while the process of managing project requirements is known as requirements management. To design a high-quality project, effective requirements management is imperative. A number of techniques are already available to perform the requirement gathering process, and software developers apply them to collect the requirements. Nevertheless, they are facing many issues in gathering requirements due to a lack of literature on the selection of appropriate methods, which affects the quality of the software. The software design quality can be improved by using requirements capture and management techniques. Some tools are used to comprehend the system accurately. In this paper, a qualitative comparison of requirements-gathering tools using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and requirements-management tools is presented for sustainable cities. With all the tools and techniques available for capturing and managing requirements, it has been proven that software developers have a wide range of alternatives for selecting the best tool that fits their needs, such as chosen by the AI agent. This effort will aid in the development of requirements for IoT-enabled sustainable cities. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Construction cost estimation is one of the essential processes in construction management. Project cost is a complex engineering problem due to various factors affecting the construction industry. Accurate cost estimation is important in construction management and significantly impacts project performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been effectively implemented in construction management studies in recent years owing to their capability to deal with complex problems. In this research, extreme gradient boosting is developed as an advanced input selector algorithm and coupled with three AI models, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) for cost estimation. Datasets were gathered based on a survey conducted on 90 building projects in Iraq. Statistical indicators and graphical methods were used to evaluate the developed models. Several input predictors were used, and XGBoost highlighted inflation as the most crucial parameter. The results indicated that the best prediction was attained by XGBoost-RF using six input parameters, with r-squared and the mean absolute percentage error equal to 0.87 and 0.25, respectively. The comparison results revealed that all AI models showed good prediction performance when applied to datasets affected by more than two parameters. The outcomes of this research revealed an optimistic strategy that can help decision makers select the influencing parameters in the early phases of project management. Also, developing a prediction model with high precision results can assist the project's estimators in decreasing the errors in the cost estimation process.  © 2022 Zainab Hasan Ali et al.},

	abstract = {The built environment is responsible for roughly 40% of global greenhouse emissions, making the sector a crucial factor for climate change and sustainability. Meanwhile, other sectors (like manufacturing) adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve complex, non-linear problems to reduce waste, inefficiency, and pollution. Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles' abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas. Finally, the literature review identified three main trends that can be a reference point for future studies made by practitioners or researchers: Digital Twin, Generative Adversarial Networks (with synthetic images) for data augmentation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. © 2022 International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction.

Empirical results are synthesized to highlight their relevance from a technology and project management standpoint, identifying several lessons learned that can be used for planning highly integrated and automated smart grid projects. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review leads to selecting 108 research articles dealing with smart grids and AIA applications. Keywords are based on the following research questions: What is the growth trend in Smart Grid projects using intelligent systems and data analytics? What business value is offered when AI-based methods are applied? How do applications of intelligent systems combine with data analytics? What lessons can be learned for Smart Grid and AIA projects? Findings: The 108 selected articles are classified according to the following four research issues in smart grids project management: AIA integrated applications; AI-focused technologies; analytics-focused technologies; architecture and design methods. A broad set of smart grid functionality is reviewed, seeking to find commonality among several applications, including as follows: dynamic energy management; automation of extract, transform and load for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems data; multi-level representations of data; the relationship between the standard three-phase transforms and modern data analytics; real-time or short-time voltage stability assessment; smart city architecture; home energy management system; building energy consumption; automated fault and disturbance analysis; and power quality control. Originality/value: Given the diversity of issues reviewed, a more capability-focused research agenda is needed to further synthesize empirical findings for AI-based smart grids. Research may converge toward more focus on business rules systems, that may best support smart grid design, proof development, governance and effectiveness. These AIA technologies must be further integrated with smart grid project management methodologies and enable a greater diversity of renewable and non-renewable production sources. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) is the inherent AI & Machine Learning (ML) based design and management approach essential across the Government processes coherence leading to alignment, agility, quick decision, effective analysis and efficient assurance. Governments and corporates are collecting an abundant amount of data every day and without an accurate analysis, data is not adequate for actionable insights. Better decision making has the potential to both improve services and save costs. The expanding use of Smart Government Enterprise Architecture (SGEA) framework in government is triggering numerous opportunities for governments worldwide. This framework may also be used by organizations to generate more accurate future prediction and to simulate complex systems that allow experimentation with various policy options. In any Government change management process, the ensuring of interoperability amongst various e-Governance systems, processes and applications across all the Government reference model for analytics is very important. The IT policymakers and the top level decision makers of any country are not concern with how each parameter introduces SGEA deliverables, but concern how national IT strategy is aligned and populated in the form of IT projects, information systems, and other IT assets throughout all references of SGEA. This paper describes the concept framework of Artificial Intelligence driven integrated architecture flow of smart government system. The concept is suitable for the strategic planning and decision making process which may provide possible strategic directions for the organization. This may be able to transform and improve the services for an achievable adaptation efficiency, simplification, cost management, collaboration, and standardization. This may help the organizations to accommodate the rapidly changing digital service usability on digitalization known as “AI driven smart-Government. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To answer the research question, a qualitative method in form of expert interviews will be used on the one hand and a discrete event simulation on the other hand to achieve quantitative results. In the simulation, it is intended to create a model without the use of AI elements. Under the same conditions, a project will be developed to support the knowledge-based tasks in the second step. The different constellations of the model can be adapted depending on the focus and the question. These models will be operationalized with parameters and will be compared under different constellations to measure the efficiency quantitatively.

Overlapping activities’ planning and their impact on the project under limited resource constraints should be considered. This study aims to develop a model for optimizing the project schedule and cost regarding overlap activities and their impacts. This study reviews previous studies on changes in past activities likely to produce additional reworking of subsequent activities. In addition, an AHP model is developed to assess the reworking time of subsequent activities based on possible changes in previous activities. In addition, five realistic construction projects are applied. Finally, an optimizing model is developed for optimizing project time and cost using overlapping techniques by using the Java program. The results indicate that the pro-posed model can be used by project managers easily for solving time and cost optimization prob-lems. In addition, it can be updated to continuously improve its functionality. Finally, it can be updated later to support AI for finding better solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is written as a critical essay reflecting the experience and reflections of the author with many ideas drawn from and extending selected items from project management, artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics literatures. Findings: Neither AI nor sophisticated analytics is likely to elicit hands on attention from project managers, other than those producing AI or analytics-based artifacts or using these tools to create their products and services. However, through the conduit of packaged software support for project management, new tools and approaches can be expected to more effectively support current activities, to streamline or eliminate activities that can be automated, to extend current capabilities with the availability of increased data, computing capacity and mathematically based algorithms and to suggest ways to reconceive how projects are done and whether they are needed. Research limitations/implications: This essay includes projections of possible, some likely and some unlikely, events and states that have not yet occurred. Although the hope and purpose are to alert readers to the possibilities of what may occur as logical extensions of current states, it is improbable that all such projections will come to pass at all or in the way described. Nonetheless, consideration of the future ranging from current trends, the interplay among intersecting trends and scenarios of future states can sharpen awareness of the effects of current choices regarding actions, decisions and plans improving the probability that the authors can move toward desired rather than undesired future states. Practical implications: Project managers not involved personally with creating AI or analytics products can avoid mastering detailed skill sets in AI and analytics, but should scan for new software features and affordances that they can use enable new levels of productivity, net benefit creation and ability to sleep well at night.

	abstract = {The development of a new product can be accelerated by using an approach called crowdsourcing. The engineers compete and try their best to provide the related solution based on the given product requirement submitted in the online crowdsourcing platform. The one who has submitted the best solution get a financial reward. This approach is proven to be three time faster than the conventional one. However, the crowdsourcing process is usually not transparent to a new user. The risk for the execution of a new project for developing a new product is not easy to be calculated [1, 2]. We developed a method InnoCrowd to handle this problem and the new user could use during the planning of a new product development project. This system uses AI concepts to generate a knowledgebase representing histories of successful product development projects. The system uses the knowledge to determine qualitative and quantitative risks of a new project. This paper describes the new method, the InnoCrowd design, and results of a validation experiment based on data from a current crowdsourcing platform. Finally, we compare InnoCrowd to related methods and systems in terms of design and benefits. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

Smart DSM and sector coupling are options with growing potential to integrate flexibilities into the grid, supporting decarbonization, decentralization, and digitization. Advancing the available flexibility of smart demand side applications, the energy system will be enabled to operate in a more sustainable and reliable way. The German-Finnish RD project FUSE (FUture Smart Energy) attempts to increase the resilience of distribution grids by developing and investigating methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for integrated planning and operation of multi-energy applications, supply infrastructure and local network conditions. For performance testing and assessment, the applied methods are implemented in a Smart Grid laboratory integrating process and/or buffer storage flexibility. An optimization framework is established to find the optimum system design and operation of resources. With the developed methods soft-control signals are generated automatically for available resources, enabling dynamic and decentralized control of demand side applications, while preserving independence of stakeholders. First performance testing runs show promising results. Ongoing development activities include improvement of system forecasts and determination of dynamically changing flexibility levels of participating devices. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Drug labeling contains an ‘INDICATIONS AND USAGE’ that provides vital information to support clinical decision making and regulatory management. Effective extraction of drug indication information from free-text based resources could facilitate drug repositioning projects and help collect real-world evidence in support of secondary use of approved medicines. To enable AI-powered language models for the extraction of drug indication information, we used manual reading and curation to develop a Drug Indication Classification and Encyclopedia (DICE) based on FDA approved human prescription drug labeling. A DICE scheme with 7,231 sentences categorized into five classes (indications, contradictions, side effects, usage instructions, and clinical observations) was developed. To further elucidate the utility of the DICE, we developed nine different AI-based classifiers for the prediction of indications based on the developed DICE to comprehensively assess their performance. We found that the transformer-based language models yielded an average MCC of 0.887, outperforming the word embedding-based Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models (0.862) with a 2.82% improvement on the test set. The best classifiers were also used to extract drug indication information in DrugBank and achieved a high enrichment rate (>0.930) for this task. We found that domain-specific training could provide more explainable models without performance sacrifices and better generalization for external validation datasets. Altogether, the proposed DICE could be a standard resource for the development and evaluation of task-specific AI-powered, natural language processing (NLP) models. © Copyright © 2021 Bhatt, Roberts, Chen, Li, Connor, Hatim, Mikailov, Tong and Liu.},

	abstract = {One of the defining trends of our time is the rapid development and spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. With the recent boom in digital innovation, AI is getting a bigger emphasis, brings new opportunities to tackle many issues within organizations and raises new challenges about its usage and limits. It is expected that more and more "smart" interconnected machines capable of situational awareness and independent decision-making will emerge. Large-scale projects are being launched all over the world including Hungary, for developing and applying automation and AI-based business solutions. AI and expert systems were already used in the fifties and later in the seventies and eighties, but results did not bring any breakthrough success. Thanks to technological development the situation has changed and many seemingly unsolvable problems (e.g. machine interpretation, facial recognition, diagnosis and prognosis of certain rare diseases) are progressing well. Beside "human" knowledge, "machine" and common "human-machine" knowledge play an increasing role, in addition to "human" creativity "machine" creativity gains ground. In the field of Knowledge Management (KM), both theoretically and practically important issues arise like how the development of technology affects KM or how AI can contribute to the organization of knowledge, and how it can facilitate and extend the future of knowledge workers. The research is intended to map the future of KM and knowledge workers in the light of the emergence of knowledge generated by emerging technologies. The research is carried out via qualitative methodology by conducting interviews that result in organizational case studies with respondents from various organizations operating in Hungary. Just as effective adaptation of KM and today's technological achievements play an essential role in the survival of companies, it can be a significant advantage if the knowledge created during application of emerging technologies is managed in some way. © The Authors, 2021.

As technology is evolving day by day and to sustain itself in the food industry the restaurant needs to come up with new and innovative services which they can provide to the customers. Pandemic has made a major impact on the business of the restaurant industry in 2020. This paper will help to understand how technology can help in food ordering, while taking care of the COVID-19 pandemic guidelines. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in the food industry and suggest methods that would help restaurants to adapt to challenges that originate from COVID-19. One of the ways would be to automate the food ordering process. Our Project 'Contactless food ordering system' is a mobile application operated by a voice assistant. That the client (The Restaurant Customer) can use to scan through the restaurant menu and view various food categories and items like 'Starter' 'Drinks' etc. and place their order through the Application. They can modify and confirm their order, as well as make their payment. The aim of the study is to reduce the point of contact during COVID-19 and automate the ordering and billing process, simplifying the work. Thus, providing a totally computerized, automated, and scalable food ordering system that will assist the business by reducing their workload, provide better management and smooth operation. The restaurant can also use various other means to increase their presence as a business.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about ‘validation dark spots’ in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research. © 2021 42nd International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2021 TREOs: "Building Sustainability and Resilience with IS: A Call for Action".

This is due, among other things, to the sheer amount of traffic that they are expected to support, the decentralized nature of the architectures and the services they run. In these future communication networks, orchestration and management mechanisms will be more complicated when compared to previous communication technologies, and centralized legacy solutions are expected to be limited in ensuring revenue for the infrastructure providers, the service providers and a good Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end users.In order to tackle the issues of orchestration and management, both academia and industry have provided state of the art contributions based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its integration into 5G/B5G networks. Among these, we can find advanced forms of traffic forecasting, admission control (for network slices and user service requests) solutions based on AI and decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper summarizes some of the AI-based solutions developed by the authors as contributions to the problems of orchestration and management in 5G/B5G networks developed within the framework of the MonB5G project. The contributions in this scope are: 1) SCHEMA, a distributed RL mechanism for Service Function Placement (SFC), 2) CATP, a Context-Aware Traffic Predictor, and 3) Pre-BAC, an admission control mechanisms that exploits advanced time-series forecasting. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The construction industry is generally regarded as information intensive. Building information modeling (BIM) has been developed to provide considerable information support for construction activities. As more data is aggregated in building information models, it is more difficult and time-consuming to extract useful building information for construction project team members with limited BIM experience. In Industry 4.0, deep learning-based conversational artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide more opportunities to support human daily life. Similarly, for smart construction, a conversational AI information retrieval system is considered important to provide building information support. This research aims to develop a conversational intelligent query answering (QA) system for attribute information retrieval from building information models. The methodology of the QA system for BIM was developed based on the Google pre-trained deep learning language neural network (NN) algorithm-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. A Python-based prototype program was developed based on the methodology. Building attribute information-related queries were generated to test the accuracy of the developed QA system for BIM. The preliminary results indicate that the developed prototype achieved an 80.0 accuracy score, meaning 80 predictions exactly matched their ground truths, for providing answers to building attribute information-related queries. The developed QA system methodology for BIM was also found to be valid and relatively accurate. The contribution of this research facilitates the development of conversational AI systems that provide convenient information support for onsite and offsite construction personnel, and the developed QA system for BIM can be extended to other information retrieval areas. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, end-to-end performance analysis and optimization will be key features to effectively manage the diverse requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries over the same shared infrastructure. To enable such a vision, the MARSAL project targets the development and evaluation of a complete framework for the management and orchestration of network resources in 5G and beyond, by utilizing a converged optical-wireless network infrastructure in the access and fronthaul/midhaul segments. At the network design domain, MARSAL targets the development of novel cell-free based solutions by exploiting the application of the distributed cell-free concept and of the serial fronthaul approach, while contributing innovative functionalities to the O-RAN project. In parallel, in the fronthaul/midhaul segments MARSAL aims to radically increase the flexibility of optical access architectures via different levels of fixed-mobile convergence. At the network and service management domain, the design philosophy of MARSAL is to exploit novel ML-based algorithms of both edge and midhaul DCs, by incorporating the Virtual Elastic DataCenters/Infrastructures paradigm. Finally, at the network security domain, MARSAL aims to introduce mechanisms that provide privacy and security to application workload and data, targeting to allow applications and users to maintain control over their data, while AI and and Blockchain technologies will be developed in order to guarantee a secured multi-tenant slicing environment. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Strategies for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into thyroid nodule management require additional development and testing. We developed a deep-learning AI model (ThyNet) to differentiate between malignant tumours and benign thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate how ThyNet could help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary fine needle aspiration. Methods: ThyNet was developed and trained on 18 049 images of 8339 patients (training set) from two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China) and tested on 4305 images of 2775 patients (total test set) from seven hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the Guangzhou Army General Hospital, Guangzhou, China; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China) in three stages. All nodules in the training and total test set were pathologically confirmed. The diagnostic performance of ThyNet was first compared with 12 radiologists (test set A); a ThyNet-assisted strategy, in which ThyNet assisted diagnoses made by radiologists, was developed to improve diagnostic performance of radiologists using images (test set B); the ThyNet assisted strategy was then tested in a real-world clinical setting (using images and videos; test set C). In a simulated scenario, the number of unnecessary fine needle aspirations avoided by ThyNet-assisted strategy was calculated. Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for accurate diagnosis of ThyNet (0·922 [95% CI 0·910–0·934]) was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (0·839 [0·834–0·844]; p<0·0001). Furthermore, ThyNet-assisted strategy improved the pooled AUROC of the radiologists from 0·837 (0·832–0·842) when diagnosing without ThyNet to 0·875 (0·871–0·880; p<0·0001) with ThyNet for reviewing images, and from 0·862 (0·851–0·872) to 0·873 (0·863–0·883; p<0·0001) in the clinical test, which used images and videos. In the simulated scenario, the number of fine needle aspirations decreased from 61·9% to 35·2% using the ThyNet-assisted strategy, while missed malignancy decreased from 18·9% to 17·0%. Interpretation: The ThyNet-assisted strategy can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists and help reduce unnecessary fine needle aspirations for thyroid nodules.

	abstract = {Technology has changed the face of almost every sphere of life including the healthcare system which was erstwhile considered a subject of pure clinical evaluation. The onset of the Covid 19 pandemic underscored adaptation to technology as the singular solution to address the banes of the huge number of people afflicted with it globally with limited healthcare workers and resources. The opening of a small healthcare centre in the Al Ras region marked the beginning of healthcare in Dubai. The healthcare system of the UAE has grown exponentially over the years, and it now offers a variety of specialized services that sets it apart from the others. The UAE healthcare industry is increasingly improving to meet the changing needs of its people as well as the country's goal to become a regional medical tourism hub. The government is implementing several long-term projects to achieve balanced growth and to incorporate sustainable growth in the industry while meeting the immediate needs of the population. Comprehensive health-care reforms have been enacted over the last ten years. This paper examines the development and results of Health-Care reforms in the UAE using primary data collected by conducting a survey in a prominent health organization in the UAE. The main aim of the survey was to study the impact of digitalization on the healthcare sector in the UAE. The case in point was the influence of digitalized measures including Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in handling the Covid-19 situation from the point of view of the healthcare sector employees. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to produce a wealth of techniques, mostly coming from the inductive form of AI also known as Machine Learning (ML). The majority of ML algorithms is industry-neutral and business process agnostic. ML innovation is propelled by publicly available research, which gets harvested into Open Source for wide distribution through software and Cloud vendors.Ongoing AI technology work creates an immense source of assets for data-driven modeling, delivered as software libraries. However, the application of these assets for data monetization in finance does not happen with nearly comparable success or speed. The latter challenge is commonly known as the scalability problem of AI. As new techniques continue to grow vigorously, the investment from large finance institutions to cost-effectively produce applications for a variety of lines-of-business (LoBs) and business processes will increase. The availability of ML capabilities on Public Cloud is a way for enterprises to increase productivity by benefiting from the best AI assets available from providers and startups. But data is constrained in terms of location, access and use in most finance competences by either laws or internal Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) rules. Legal limitations include, and go beyond, Privacy Acts, impacting non-retail processes where AI techniques must be explained in layperson language to decision-makers and regulators before field deployment. The latter is not yet achieved satisfactorily. Lastly, a large percentage of AI projects fail, in part due to unsuitable ML modeling for analytics and forecasting problems in finance. The variety and complexity of human behavior present in most finance processes calls for understanding AI at a level of cognitive depth that has no precedent in other industries. It is imperative that AI be approached so that finance competence and functional specificity are embedded a-priori into ML techniques and not as use-case afterthoughts. For acceleration of AI assessments, it is critical that ML techniques available in software implement models readily aligned to finance problems.This paper presents an approach to building an Architecture for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Finance by focusing on analytics and forecasting for business-to-business operations. This AI Architecture hinges on three axes and their interplay: Design Dimensions, Modeling Building-Blocks and Work-Practice. The goal is to support finance practitioners navigate the plethora of AI options more effectively and accelerate data monetization. While ML techniques in data analytics and forecasting apply to many scenarios, this paper focuses on selected competences in Banking, Financial Markets and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) operations.The architecture and method introduced in this paper is a first step toward a service practice. We harvest from our work carried out in banks, asset management firms and CFO lines-of-business as well as RD experiences in new finance technologies for over one decade. As with any other architecture and deployment methodology, this work requires further harvesting, more information technology tools and sharing experiences across practitioners. It is hoped that finance organizations could adopt these new capabilities in their own Centers of Excellence or other internal organizations leading data-driven transformation and monetization across the firm. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face global challenges and continuous change in consumer demands, most recently COVID-19 and the prospect of a future Serious Acute Respiratory (SARS) pandemic generating further challenges, thus SMEs require to be more flexible to respond quickly to these changes. This can be achieved by transformation into the digital economy, use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, integrating business processes and to have real-time information which will enable senior management to make better, quicker informed decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the solutions for the SMEs to overcome these challenges and to obtain a competitive advantage. Subanidja, and Broto, 2019 stated that ERP systems are still not widely implemented by SMEs compared to their introduction in large businesses. However, the SME have a justifiable reputation for being proactive, open, willing and receptive to the adoption of new technologies, concepts and improvements. Also, SMEs differ in several inherent characteristics which are likely to impact on the ERP system implementations, hence it does not make sense to use the same frameworks that have been developed for large companies to implement ERP system within SMEs. One of the main risks of adopting ERP in SMEs is that SMEs have limited resources, so they cannot afford to fail to implement ERP system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore ERP implementation process in SME context. The developed framework has been used to implement an ERP system in a SME. It highlighted the issues that need to be addressed while implementing ERP system in SMEs such as clearly defined scope of implementation procedure, suitable project planning and minimal customisation of the system selected for implementation. This study contributed to both research and practice and the research findings could aid practitioners and SMEs when embarking on ERP projects, as well as, to suggest future research avenues. © 2021 The Authors.

Yet it remains rare to find AI solutions deployed in routine healthcare settings. This is in part due to the numerous challenges inherent in delivering an AI project in a clinical environment. In this article, several UK healthcare professionals and academics reflect on the challenges they have faced in building AI solutions using routinely collected healthcare data. These personal reflections are summarised as 10 practical tips. In our experience, these are essential considerations for an AI healthcare project to succeed. They are organised into four phases: conceptualisation, data management, AI application and clinical deployment. There is a focus on conceptualisation, reflecting our view that initial set-up is vital to success. We hope that our personal experiences will provide useful insights to others looking to improve patient care through optimal data use.  © },

However, the failure rate of projects on implementing AI in organizations is still high, and prevents organizations from fully seizing the potential that AI exhibits. To contribute to closing this gap, we seize the unique opportunity to gain insights from five organizational cases. In particular, we empirically investigate how the unique characteristics of AI – i.e. experimental character, context sensitivity, black box character, and learning requirements – induce challenges into project management, and how these challenges are addressed in organizational (socio-technical) contexts. This shall provide researchers with an empirical and conceptual foundation for investigating the cause-effect relationships between the characteristics of AI, project management, and organizational change. Practitioners can benchmark their own practices against the insights to increase the success rates of future AI implementations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Computers control increasing numbers of objects in our daily life: phones, aircraft, cars, buildings, manufacturing machines, musical instruments, etc. In these so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), computers interact directly with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Those systems are becoming the key infrastructure and backbone of our society and are at the heart of revolutionary changes in our daily lives and economy. The sophistication and complexity of CPSs keep increasing since they must realize more functions with limited resources, which makes them increasingly difficult to build and manage. In particular, the cyber (software) part of these systems is growing rapidly and has become a key part of CPS, as they are the basis of operation for these systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a fundamental influence on the economy, administration, and society. AI is now also affecting software engineering, providing robust approaches for software development to analyze and evaluate complex software and its development processes. Repository mining, machine learning, big data analytics, and software visualization enable targeted insights and powerful predictions for software quality, software development, and software project management. The research community has shown a keen interest in this emerging field.

In this chapter, we will discuss the various methods that keep evolving as a major concern in the place of unsupervised learning for the AI. Being an underlying model or the hidden structure for the distribution in the data of unsupervised learning is that any one can only have input data formed up with no corresponding output variables. Being a machine learning task, this type of learning has numerous types of hidden patterns or the underlying structures which combats to give input data in order to learn about the data more rigorously. Later knowing about the applications, you will be going to see how the edge cutting open source AI technologies are evolving that can be used to take out the machine learning projects to the next level. This involves a number of lists of the different open source machine learning platforms which have the ability to use the unsupervised data as a framework for the machine learning. Some of them are as listed which you will have more brief view later on, these are TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, etc. Since unsupervised learning is also used to draw inferences from the different datasets which again consists the data without the labeled responses. Going in with the applications of the unsupervised learning, you will also discover new machine learning algorithm which is going to be more evolved in upcoming market. © 2021 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Since 2017, anticipated AI usage in Malaysia has increased by 32 percent due to innovative city projects and public safety and intelligent transportation applications. However, such AI development is afflicted by privacy and data breaches as the existing data protection regulation safeguards against unlawful commercial use of personal data. Recent developments reflect the failure of present legal mechanisms to address such infringements and effective data management and protection deficiencies. This study examines the legal concerns of privacy and data protection and problems associated with the use of AI in Malaysia. This research adopts a methodology of doctrinal research, a systematic method of legal reasoning, including analyzing primary and secondary resources. The findings imply that AI evolves, magnifying the ability to use personal information that may affect privacy. Thus, infringement of privacy and use of personal data without legal oversight or effective governance could result in privacy deprivation and abuse of personal data that might be used to perpetrate crimes © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Construction planning is a fundamental task in the management of construction projects. The most common modeling methods for construction planning are linear scheduling (LS), the critical path method (CPM), and discrete-event simulation (DES). While LS and CPM have advantages of visual feedback and simplicity, respectively, DES as a technique for simulating the behavior and output of a real-world process, facility, or system is the most versatile of these methods. However, when the constraints and dimensionality of a planning problem increase, DES methods are cumbersome and struggle to accurately reflect decision options. As an alternative to DES, deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) methods can, through the use of reinforcement learning, more rapidly review and recommend more planning options for scheduling complex construction projects. The goal of this paper is to examine the feasibility of deep learning AI as an alternative to the DES in an existing project planning method, named Foresight. Foresight is a graphical constraint-based method of planning manufacturing and construction processes that uses DES to simulate possible outcomes. This paper presents the process changes necessary in Foresight to accommodate deep learning algorithms, composed of multiple network layers. In addition, challenges of implementing deep learning AI in construction planning are discussed. Early project planning leads to improved performance in terms of cost, schedule, and operations, balancing the competing needs of a project. A new modeling paradigm is proposed that is better suited to the needs of contemporary construction project planning. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

In the case of social housing and the establishment of physical domains for life, commoning is an intersection of these contracts and the restrictions and policies that prohibit and allow them to occur within municipalities. Via a platform-based project entitled Public Parts (2020), this article will also present positions on the reification of the common through a set of design methodologies and implementations of automation. This platform seeks to subvert typical platform models to decrease ownership, increase access, and produce a new form of communal autonomous life amongst individuals that constitute the rapidly expanding freelance, work from home, and gig economies. Furthermore, this text investigates the consequences of merging domestic space with artificial intelligence by implementing machine learning to reconfigure spaces and program. The problems that arise from the deployment of machine learning algorithms involve issues of collection, usage, and ownership of data. Through the physical design of space, and a central AI which manages the platform and the automated management of space, the core objective of Public Parts is to reify the common through architecture and collectively owned data. © The Author(s) 2021.},

For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, and sketches, among many other data management tasks. Arguably, the ideas behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, these techniques will allow us to build “instance-optimized” systems: that is, systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance without the need for tuning by an administrator. While many of these techniques promise orders-of-magnitude better performance in lab settings, there is still general skepticism about how practical the current techniques really are. The following is intended as a progress report on ML for Systems and its readiness for real-world deployments, with a focus on our projects done as part of the Data Systems and AI Lab (DSAIL) at MIT. By no means is it a comprehensive overview of all existing work, which has been steadily growing over the past several years not only in the database community but also in the systems, networking, theory, PL, and many other adjacent communities. © The authors.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications, in tandem with the extensive variation of building products, pose new demands on design and engineering firms to efficiently manage and reuse BIM content (i.e., data-rich parametric model objects and assembly details). Tasks such as classifying BIM objects, indexing them with meta-data (e.g., category), and searching digital libraries to load objects into models still plague practice with inefficient manual workflows. This research aims to improve the productivity of BIM content management and retrieval by developing an AI-backed BIM content recommender system. Using data from a case-study firm, this research extracted content from over 30,000 technical BIM views (e.g., plans, sections, details) in historical projects to build an unsupervised machine-learning prototype with association rule mining. This prototype explicated the strength of relationships among co-occurring BIM objects. Using this prototype as the backbone AI-engine in live BIM sessions, this research developed a context-aware recommender system that dynamically provides BIM users with a set of objects associable with their modeling context (e.g., type of view, existing objects in the model) and human–computer interactions (e.g., objects selected by the user). By mining association data from hundreds of historical projects, this development marks a departure from the existing prototypes that rely on explicit coding, recurring user input, or subjective ratings to recommend BIM content to users. The simulation and experimental implementation of this recommender system yielded high efficacy in predicting content needs and achieved significant savings in the time spent on conventional BIM workflows. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The professional field most closely linked to AI, and especially ML, is that of the data scientist. One of the most important tasks that a data scientist can perform, in collaboration with stakeholders, is that of translating a business problem to a specification for the AI-based system.

The researchers developed i-Detect project to provide home automation in smart lighting and switching, smoke and fire detection and mitigation systems that will contribute to disaster risk reduction and management. The project uses a water-scrum-fall approach under agile methodology in developing the system since it involves integration between hardware and software. During the tests conducted in three (3) trials, the results were successful because it performed according to the intended function. The voice-activated home automation carried the commands accordingly; the exhaust fans activated when smoke/gas was detected, and water pumps activated when a fire was detected. It was observed that as long as the internet connection is stable the home automation will successfully execute. On the other hand, the smoke/gas and fire detection and mitigation can still be executed without relying on the internet connection.

	abstract = {A total of 34% of AI research and development projects fail or are abandoned, according to a recent survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870 companies. In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top n potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company's risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Information technology is based on data management between various sources. Software projects, as varied as simple applications or as complex as self-driving cars, are heavily reliant on the amounts, and types, of data ingested by one or more interconnected systems. Data is not only consumed but is transformed or mutated which requires copious amounts of computing resources. One of the most exciting areas of cyber-physical systems, autonomous vehicles, makes heavy use of deep learning and AI to mimic the highly complex actions of a human driver. Attempting to map human behavior (a large and abstract concept) requires large amounts of data, used by AIs to increase their knowledge and better attempt to solve complex problems. This paper outlines a full-fledged solution for managing resources in a multi-cloud environment. The purpose of this API is to accommodate ever-increasing resource requirements by leveraging the multi-cloud and using commercially available tools to scale resources and make systems more resilient while remaining as cloud agnostic as possible. To that effect, the work herein will consist of an architectural breakdown of the resource management API, a low-level description of the implementation and an experiment aimed at proving the feasibility, and applicability of the systems described. © 2021 by the authors.

However, contractors do not share the necessary information with the contracted parties and thus give rise to the asymmetric information (AI) phenomenon. The aim of this study is to perform an analysis of the determining factors in the adoption of relational contracting (RC) in combination with Building Information Modelling (BIM) to reduce AI. The results of a questionnaire survey, which was e-mailed to 14 specialists with solid experience (over twenty years) and knowledge in construction projects, revealed that the probability of the AI phenomenon occurring in Portugal is very high, and its impact on construction projects is equally high. The results also show that RC in combination with the BIM methodology contributes very positively to the mitigation of AI problems in construction projects in Portugal. Approximately 85% of respondents consider that the government should seek to reduce AI in the public works sector through the use of RC and its combination with the BIM methodology in the Portuguese Public Contracts Code. © 2021 The Author(s).

Data layers of the knowledge pyramid are formed by the sensors and input devices, whereas knowledge layers are the result of knowledge extraction applied on data layers. The knowledge pyramid and KM helps in making the use of IoT and big data easily. In this manuscript, the knowledge management principles capture the handwritten gestures numerically and get it recognized correctly by the software.

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods: The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results: The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions: The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The focus of the tutorial is on the issues of transparency and interpretability as they relate to building models for text and their applications to knowledge discovery. As black-box models have gained popularity for a broad range of tasks in recent years, both the research and industry communities have begun developing new techniques to render them more transparent and interpretable. Reporting from an interdisciplinary team of social science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and NLP/knowledge management researchers, our tutorial has two components: an introduction to explainable AI (XAI) in the NLP domain and a review of the state-of-the-art research; and findings from a qualitative interview study of individuals working on real-world NLP projects as they are applied to various knowledge extraction and discovery at a large, multinational technology and consulting corporation. The first component will introduce core concepts related to explainability in NLP. Then, we will discuss explainability for NLP tasks and report on a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art literature in AI, NLP and HCI conferences. The second component reports on our qualitative interview study, which identifies practical challenges and concerns that arise in real-world development projects that require the modeling and understanding of text data.  © 2021 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Plant projects, referred to as Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC), generate massive amounts of data throughout their life cycle, from the planning stages to the operation and maintenance (OM) stages. Many EPC contractors struggle with their projects due to the complexity of the decision-making processes, owing to the vast amount of project data generated during each project stage. In line with the fourth industrial revolution, the demand for engineering project management solutions to apply artificial intelligence (AI) in big data technology is increasing. The purpose of this study was to predict the risk of contractor and support decision-making at each project stage using machine-learning (ML) technology based on data generated in the bidding, engineering, construction, and OM stages of EPC projects. As a result of this study, the Engineering Machine-learning Automation Platform (EMAP), a cloud-based integrated analysis tool applied with big data and AI/ML technology, was developed. EMAP is an intelligent decision support system that consists of five modules: Invitation to Bid (ITB) Analysis, Design Cost Estimation, Design Error Checking, Change Order Forecasting, and Equipment Predictive Maintenance, using advanced AI/ML algorithms. In addition, each module was validated through case studies to assure the performance and accuracy of the module. This study contributes to the strengthening of the risk response for each stage of the EPC project, especially preventing errors by the project managers, and improving their work accuracy. Project risk management using AI/ML breaks away from the existing risk management practices centered on statistical analysis, and further expands the research scalability of related works. © 2021 by the authors.

This invention is based on an innovative paradigm shift in human communication within organizations that function based on workflows or modern production cycles. The previous communication models like email or social media solutions such as Slack, Yammer and MS Teams fail in providing optimal communications due to the inherent flaws in their models. The current invention addresses these flaws by introducing a framework which focuses on the specific topics of interest or components of a product or project as they move through the production cycle or workflow. The result is a communication system which guarantees optimality with zero noise to information ratio. Recipients in this network are guaranteed to receive only messages directly relevant to them. Moreover, everyone in the team including ordinary stakeholders from 'rank and file' can effortlessly monitor the status of and gain real time insight into their topics of interest as a direct benefit of this new model. Additionally, this same invention provides for a novel framework to incorporate AI into every aspect of an organization's workflow in direct collaboration and assistance to the human resources in a seamless fashion. The latter can potentially have a profound impact on accelerating the trend of the merging of humans and AI within an organization's workflow. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The integration and automation of the whole design and implementation process have become a pivotal factor in construction projects. Problems of process integration, particularly at the conceptual design stage, often manifest through a number of significant areas, from design representation, cognition and translation to process fragmentation and loss of design integrity. Whilst building information modelling (BIM) applications can be used to support design automation, particularly through the modelling, amendment and management stages, they do not explicitly provide whole design integration. This is a significant challenge. However, advances in generative design now offer significant potential for enhancing the design experience to mitigate this challenge. Design/methodology/approach: The approach outlined in this paper specifically addresses BIM deficiencies at the conceptual design stage, where the core drivers and indicators of BIM and generative design are identified and mapped into a generative BIM (G-BIM) framework and subsequently embedded into a G-BIM prototype. This actively engages generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment to support the early conceptual design process. The developed prototype followed the CIFE “horseshoe” methodology of aligning theoretical research with scientific methods to procure architecture, construction and engineering (AEC)-based solutions. This G-BIM prototype was also tested and validated through a focus group workshop engaging five AEC domain experts. Findings: The G-BIM prototype presents a valuable set of rubrics to support the conceptual design stage using generative design. It benefits from the advanced features of BIM tools in relation to illustration and collaboration (coupled with BIM's parametric change management features). Research limitations/implications: This prototype has been evaluated through multiple projects and scenarios. However, additional test data is needed to further improve system veracity using conventional and non-standard real-life design settings (and contexts). This will be reported in later works. Originality/value: Originality and value rest with addressing the shortcomings of previous research on automation during the design process. It also addresses novel computational issues relating to the implementation of generative design systems, where, for example, instead of engaging static and formal description of the domain concepts, G-BIM actively enhances the applicability of BIM during the early design stages to generate optimised (and more purposeful) design solutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The use of LPG in a safe and responsible manner is a necessity of life whereas it is also a necessity to advance the LPG system, but inconsolably until now, no major revolutionary steps are taken to implement the safety and advancement in the field of LPG system. We all observed that the booking and handling gas stove is a bit more laborious task; to first book the cylinder by handling the calls and data and then delivering; these are very cost-consuming and laborious work. To contribute to the motion of safe, advanced, and more responsibility of LPG, we came with an innovative product to satisfy the concern regarding the safe use of LPG gas as well as way more advanced and comfortable transaction between customer and distributor in case of domestic usage of LPG. Our whole idea revolves around the Internet of things and artificial intelligence. The need of this project is to save the time and life of the consumer while operating the gas system, as we are introducing automatic gas booking system, gas leakage detection system, and smart gas stove. Hence, these features are justifying the name of this product “The Advance LPG System (ALS).” © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Whether for work, for leisure or for moving goods necessary for health, people and industry, mobility is a fundamental aspect of economic and social life of each community. Unfortunately, it is not without costs for the society: gas emissions, air, water and noise pollution, road crashes, congestions, are examples which affect health and environment. For these reasons the most severe challenge for the transportation sector is to become more sustainable, resilient and safe. All can be possible only betting on green mobility and cutting-edge digital technologies. According to this vision, the “Smart Urban Mobility Management” (SUMMa) project has been proposed, with the aim to develop, for the Artena Municipality, new service structures for modernizing and managing transportation systems, by means of digital technologies and 5G communication networks. In particular the proposed digital platform, thanks to enhanced Mobile Broadband, massive Machine Type Communications and Mobile Edge Computing, can support Artificial Intelligence algorithms for recognition image and interpretation of field data, collected by drones or H-D cameras. In real time, Origin-Destination flows, individual trips and environmental data can be update and traffic, congestion and health information can be shared with the citizens. In this paper, the general architecture of the SUMMa platform has been described and preliminary findings of the pilot project in the Municipality of Artena have been presented. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual 'Workflows Community Summits' (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Warfare is increasing in complexity, speed, and scale—not only due to enhanced technological capabilities but also from the employment methodologies associated with them. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) technology into this realm is a cogent solution to help address these complications because of the reduced cost, reduced risk to human life, and increased capability to rapidly adapt to changing environments. However, the introduction of AI comes with a host of new considerations. If AI is to be successfully integrated into air combat, humans must be included in the AI processing loop, and human interaction with AI decision loops must be frictionless. Additionally, AI-supported battle management systems must be designed for high and increasing human trust across dynamically changing scenarios.

	abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are difficult to diagnose early and have risk factors that are easy to overlook. Early prediction and personalization of treatment through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help clinicians and patients manage CVDs more effectively. However, to apply AI approaches to CVDs data, it is necessary to establish and curate a specialized database based on electronic health records (EHRs) and include pre-processed unstructured data. Methods: To build a suitable database (CardioNet) for CVDs that can utilize AI technology, contributing to the overall care of patients with CVDs. First, we collected the anonymized records of 748,474 patients who had visited the Asan Medical Center (AMC) or Ulsan University Hospital (UUH) because of CVDs. Second, we set clinically plausible criteria to remove errors and duplication. Third, we integrated unstructured data such as readings of medical examinations with structured data sourced from EHRs to create the CardioNet. We subsequently performed natural language processing to structuralize the significant variables associated with CVDs because most results of the principal CVD-related medical examinations are free-text readings. Additionally, to ensure interoperability for convergent multi-center research, we standardized the data using several codes that correspond to the common data model. Finally, we created the descriptive table (i.e., dictionary of the CardioNet) to simplify access and utilization of data for clinicians and engineers and continuously validated the data to ensure reliability. Results: CardioNet is a comprehensive database that can serve as a training set for AI models and assist in all aspects of clinical management of CVDs. It comprises information extracted from EHRs and results of readings of CVD-related digital tests. It consists of 27 tables, a code-master table, and a descriptive table. Conclusions: CardioNet database specialized in CVDs was established, with continuing data collection. We are actively supporting multi-center research, which may require further data processing, depending on the subject of the study. CardioNet will serve as the fundamental database for future CVD-related research projects. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {AI is one of the biggest megatrends towards the 4th industrial revolution. Although these technologies promise business sustainability as well as product and process quality, it seems that the ever-changing market demands, the complexity of technologies and fair concerns about privacy, impede broad application and reuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across the industry. To break the entry barriers for these technologies and unleash its full potential, the knowlEdge project will develop a new generation of AI methods, systems, and data management infrastructure. Subsequently, as part of the knowlEdge project we propose several major innovations in the areas of data management, data analytics and knowledge management including (i) a set of AI services that allows the usage of edge deployments as computational and live data infrastructure as well as a continuous learning execution pipeline on the edge, (ii) a digital twin of the shop-floor able to test AI models, (iii) a data management framework deployed along the edge-to-cloud continuum ensuring data quality, privacy and confidentiality, (iv) Human-AI Collaboration and Domain Knowledge Fusion tools for domain experts to inject their experience into the system, (v) a set of standardisation mechanisms for the exchange of trained AI models from one context to another, and (vi) a knowledge marketplace platform to distribute and interchange trained AI models. In this paper, we present a short overview of the EU Project knowlEdge - Towards Artificial Intelligence powered manufacturing services, processes, and products in an edge-to-cloud-knowledge continuum for humans [in-the-loop], which is funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Framework Programme of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 957331.

Through the CLEAR program, end-users can enter lessons learned and best practices gained in their workplace in addition to soliciting solutions to any ongoing issue. This paper briefly reviews the development of CLEAR and proposes an intelligent knowledge transference process of information on NCDOT projects using natural language processing and knowledge graphs based on neural language models developed by the CLEAR project team. The CLEAR project includes a collection of documented lessons learned and best practices. The AI model learns an inference model of the domain vocabulary from various sources such as contract documents, textbooks, and specifications. This model allows the system to make meaningful connections between lessons learned and best practices within CLEAR and the project-specific domain knowledge. The model output will initially be shown to NCDOT team members belonging to various project life cycle phases such as design, construction, and maintenance to certify the usefulness of the generated keywords and thereby the AI model in an iterative manner until the model has been appropriately fine-tuned. Necessary modifications will be made to the model based on the feedback obtained from project personnel to ensure high-quality output. In the long run, this automation in information retrieval will encourage NCDOT personnel to use the CLEAR program as a part of their routine work to improve project workflow processes. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

The findings based on sequential literature review revealed that various AI technologies exists, and each has a different purpose and application. The research findings reveal application of each AI technology on each project life cycle phase. A theoretical framework based on the research findings is developed which illustrates the application of AI technologies across the project lifecycle and the results of each application. AI can be used in planning, design, simulation of construction projects, it can also be used in advanced project execution phases of construction as well as in sourcing of materials and modularisation of high-end and specialised construction material and modules.

	abstract = {Greenhouse farmers around the world face multiple challenges imposed by manual tasks and must deal with complex relationships among growth environment variables. Usually, tasks are accomplished with low efficiency and high uncertainty, which becomes evident when evaluating the impact introduced by adjustments to these variables. These challenges have led to the appearance of the precision agriculture industry, as farmers attempt to automate the agricultural and commercialization processes using solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing. Although these novel technological solutions seem to tackle some of the challenges, several concerns about centralization and data silos throughout the supply chain have arisen. Thus, we propose the Interplanetary Precision Agriculture (IPA) project as an alternative to an increasing demand for better technological solutions in the sustainable food supply, required by the long-term presence of humans in any given environment. The current project aims to improve the cultivation process on and off Earth, by implementing solutions based on the IoT, AI, and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Hence, a “system of systems” is laid out. First, Magrito, a holonomic autonomous rover, is introduced to capture crop performance parameters (output variables). Second, Precision Habitat PRO, the environment controlling device, is deployed to capture growing parameters (input variables). Third, a commercial Bluetooth scale is added. Last, a Farm Management System is utilized to correlate the data captured by IoT devices with business logic. The resulting information is sent to the IOTA Tangle network to render it immutable and interoperable, at zero network processing fees with minimal energy consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Students of Software Engineering Capstone Courses face real world situations and challenges that grant them valuable experiences for their professional preparation. However, since this knowledge is acquired through real-life exposure projects, it is difficult to transmit it among different generations of students. In consequence, all the gained knowledge, experiences, and computer codes developed are lost and cannot be reused outside the project context when they finish their assignment at the end of the semester. To address this challenge, this thesis considers the development of AI based virtual assistants applied in higher education, in a form of a lesson learned system, a recommender system integrated with a chatbot, to help students, solve problems similar to those they face in the different stages of their software project development by recommending previous lessons learned. The innovative contribution lies in the implementation of the described techniques from the state-of-art artificial intelligence field in an educational platform with the goal to leverage the experience gained during years of the teaching a Capstone Course in Software Engineering to new student generations who might benefit from this universal knowledge gained previously, in order to assist software engineering students to enhance their learning experience. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) is a key technology for applications like emergency management, civilian security, and environment and resource monitoring. Demands on amount, type and quality of remote-sensing satellite data and efficient methods for data analysis have increased sharply in recent years. However, the use of satellite-based image products for scenarios which require very low-latencies, such as rapid meteorological and civil security applications, is still limited by the bottleneck created by the classical EO data chain, which involves the acquisition, compression, and storage of sensor data onboard the satellite, and its transfer to ground for further processing. Onboard processing offers a promising solution to reduce the latencies between data acquisition and product delivery to the end user. The H2020 EU project EO-ALERT (http://eo-alert-h2020.eu) implements this approach through the development of a next-generation EO data processing chain that moves optimised key elements from the ground segment to onboard the satellite. In this article, the feasibility of the concept is demonstrated using EO-ALERT's extreme weather nowcasting product as an example. The system is able to detect and track convective storms and Overshooting Tops, and to send the processed information to ground, within 5 minutes of the observation. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Despite research that addresses varying aspects of moral decision-making based upon algorithms, the definition of project success is less clear. Nevertheless, researchers place the burden of responsibility for ethical decisions on the developers of AI systems. This study used a systematic literature review to identify five categories of AI project success factors in 17 groups related to moral decision-making with algorithms. It translates AI ethical principles into practical project deliverables and actions that underpin the success of AI projects. It considers success over time by investigating the development, usage, and consequences of moral decision-making by algorithmic systems. Moreover, the review reveals and defines AI success factors within the project management literature. Project managers and sponsors can use the results during project planning and execution. © 2022, The Author(s).},

These techniques take advantage of nontraditional (or nonnumeric) data sources such as text in libraries and images from field operations. However, these techniques could be more powerful if combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and numeric sources of data in multimodal pipelines. We present several recent examples, where United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers and collaborators are using AI methods with text and images to improve core scientific knowledge, the management of agricultural research, and agricultural practice. NLP enables automated indexing, clustering, and classification for agricultural research project management. We explore two case studies where combining techniques and data sources in new ways could accelerate progress in personalized nutrition and invasive pest detection. One challenge in applying these techniques is the difficulty in obtaining high-quality training data. Other challenges are a lack of machine learning (ML) techniques customized for use and ML skills or experience among researchers and other stakeholders. Initiatives are underway at USDA-ARS to address these challenges.  © 1999-2012 IEEE.},

While the research of machine learning algorithms is very active and continues to reveal astonishing possibilities on a regular basis, the wide usage of these algorithms is shifting the research focus to the integration, maintenance, and evolution of AI-driven systems. Although there is a variety of machine learning frameworks on the market, there is little support for process automation and DevOps in machine learning-driven projects. In this paper, we discuss how metamodels can support the development of deep learning frameworks and help deal with the steadily increasing variety of learning algorithms. In particular, we present a deep learning-oriented artifact model which serves as a foundation for build automation and data management in iterative, machine learning-driven development processes. Furthermore, we show how schema and reference models can be used to structure and maintain a versatile deep learning framework. Feasibility is demonstrated on several state-of-the-art examples from the domains of image and natural language processing as well as decision making and autonomous driving.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Accelerated development of open-access, web-based information systems is an important driver of social and economic change in knowledge-based economies. Specifically, learning platforms and knowledge repositories employing modern AI tools (AILPs) strongly influence human resources management in academic institutions and corporations. AI-based information systems require efficient alignment of business models to the deployment of digital technologies, where platform marketing plays a crucial role. This is why building an appropriate marketing and exploitation strategy is fundamental in achieving the desired economic impacts of AILP operation and exploitation, and for financial decisions concerning further AILP development. This paper presents the methods and final outcomes of collaborative roadmapping as part of an exploitation and marketing strategy and user community building plan for an AILP implemented within a recent Horizon 2020 project. Platform marketing activities have a hierarchical structure. They touch upon the platform as a whole, the platform as a learning tool for its users, as well as may aim at licensing some of its stand-alone software components. The overall strategy has been composed of individual and joint activities. The strategy-building methodology consists of generating alternative action plans, evaluated by multiple criteria. The compromise action plan can be adaptively modified according to user preferences and stakeholder needs. Finally, we will present how the roadmapping diagram was built and assessed to yield a realistic strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Camera traps are used worldwide to monitor wildlife. Despite the increasing availability of Deep Learning (DL) models, the effective usage of this technology to support wildlife monitoring is limited. This is mainly due to the complexity of DL technology and high computing requirements. This paper presents the implementation of the light-weight and state-of-the-art YOLOv5 architecture for automated labeling of camera trap images of mammals in the Białowieża Forest (BF), Poland. The camera trapping data were organized and harmonized using TRAPPER software, an open-source application for managing large-scale wildlife monitoring projects. The proposed image recognition pipeline achieved an average accuracy of 85% F1-score in the identification of the 12 most commonly occurring medium-size and large mammal species in BF, using a limited set of training and testing data (a total of 2659 images with animals). Based on the preliminary results, we have concluded that the YOLOv5 object detection and classification model is a fine and promising DL solution after the adoption of the transfer learning technique. It can be efficiently plugged in via an API into existing web-based camera trapping data processing platforms such as e.g. TRAPPER system. Since TRAPPER is already used to manage and classify (manually) camera trapping datasets by many research groups in Europe, the implementation of AI-based automated species classification will significantly speed up the data processing workflow and thus better support data-driven wildlife monitoring and conservation. Moreover, YOLOv5 has been proven to perform well on edge devices, which may open a new chapter in animal population monitoring in real-time directly from camera trap devices. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to improve our lives through a wide variety of applications, many of which fall into the healthcare space; however, a lack of diversity is contributing to limitations in how broadly AI can help people. The UCSF AI4ALL program was established in 2019 to address this issue by targeting high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, giving them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine, and promoting diversity and inclusion. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, the students presented the results of their research projects at our final symposium. Comparison of pre- and post-program survey responses from students demonstrated that after the program, significantly more students were familiar with how to work with data and to evaluate and apply machine learning algorithms. There were also nominally significant increases in the students’ knowing people in AI from historically underrepresented groups, feeling confident in discussing AI, and being aware of careers in AI. We found that we were able to engage young students in AI via our online training program and nurture greater diversity in AI. This work can guide AI training programs aspiring to engage and educate students entirely online, and motivate people in AI to strive towards increasing diversity and inclusion in this field.

This article presents a methodology of user community building and management for cloud-based AI-enabled knowledge repositories (AILPs) which are considered a relevant part of enterprise learning ecosystems. Their assessment is based on the number of users, user engagement and satisfaction. Therefore, the indicators of user community growth are a basis for evaluating the quality of IS management and services. To optimize IS business performance, we applied a social impact model, derived from multi-level simulation and a self-contained multicriteria analysis framework. The model combines controlled discrete-event systems, learning cellular automata, and anticipatory decision support. These all serve to optimize user network development strategies. The primary application of this model is the exploitation of an innovative digital knowledge platform, developed within a recent Horizon 2020 research project. © 2021 42nd International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2021 TREOs: "Building Sustainability and Resilience with IS: A Call for Action".

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital transformation and challenges enterprises to adapt to its various requirements. Many companies fail to implement AI applications or have significant trouble because of data or process requirements. The changes in a company resulting from the implementation of AI applications can vary from small data format changes over a restructuring of its application landscape to the implementation or deletion of whole business processes or roles. Thus, the implementation of AI applications can significantly impact a company's enterprise architecture (EA). We argue that research could facilitate the adoption of AI and help to preserve AI projects from failing. To determine what further research is necessary, this paper seeks to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art of research on the effects of AI applications on EA. For this purpose, we performed a structured literature review (SLR), formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria, developing several search strings, applying them to four scientific databases, performing a forward and backwards search and summarizing the key findings. The (1) performance of the literature review and the (2) discussion of its findings are the main contributions of this paper, identifying a research gap as no concrete research about the effects of AI applications on enterprise architectures could be found. However, a handful of papers in the area of AI and EAM are discovered that endorse the need for further research. © 2021 IEEE.},

Establishing a basic understanding of the characteristics of this specific class of algorithms and the associated conceptual differences to classic information technology (IT) solutions is increasingly proving to be a critical success factor when introducing and running AI solutions in a safety-and security-critical environment such as commercial aviation.This paper explains how Fraport has been establishing a multilevel organisational AI approach.The approach is demonstrated at the example of the project on establishing a more precise prediction of arrival times at the gate (Estimated In-Block Time [EIBT]) which was used as a catalyst in this process. Fraport’s approach stretches across the entire solution development process, from understanding the problem and determining the room for improvement in an application-oriented data lab format called the Corporate Analytics Centre (CAC), all the way to developing a full-scale IT solution for operational use in the ‘IT Factory’.The practical experience of the first project has shown that not only technical challenges have to be solved during the development and implementation of the first AI solutions but it was also clearly a matter of establishing trust in AI solutions on various hierarchical levels on the user side. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.},

CHIM is an AI-based chatbot prototype that enables conversational interaction using text and speech input: visitors can ask questions about certain artworks and receive answers in multimodal formats (text, audio, image, video). The application will be tested in the Städel Museum, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. To develop a proper Natural Language Understanding module, we adapted an existing categorization approach, gathered visitor questions, and structured them into twelve distinct content types. The preliminary results suggest that our approach to subdivide the previously overloaded content type meaning into further categories was successful, leading to a more balanced distribution of the data. We further describe the Natural Language Processing mechanisms employed here; these follow a multi-tiered approach using techniques like Rasa, BERT, and cosine-similarity to generate answers with different degrees of effort. Future steps are the implementation of dialog management, the refinement of the NLP strategies by integrating additional answers for selected exhibits, and the implementation of the final layout and interaction design. We are planning to test and evaluate the CHIM prototype on site in the Städel Museum in late 2021. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

However, only a few works study scene understanding because it is one of the most challenging topics of intelligent monitoring. Besides, as a big construction country, China lacks corresponding AI research based on Chinese in the construction field, which seriously hinders the further development of China's construction industry. Therefore, this paper proposes a Vision-based BERT (V-BERT) model for construction activity scene understanding. A Chinese caption dataset named Images of Jobsite Daily Activity and Chinese Captions (IJDACC) is created to verify V-BERT's performance. Some data augmentation operations are then used to enlarge the training set further. Two evaluation systems are established to evaluate V-BERT's comprehensive performance. The experimental results show the V-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance in the construction area with an average performance improvement of 171.20%. © 2021 Universitätsverlag der Technischen Universität Berlin.

The research purpose is to identify specific features of legal regulation of the implementation of the constitutional right to health protection in the context of the development of artificial intelligence systems. To achieve this goal, the methods of a systematic approach, dialectical interdependence, behaviorism and political hermeneutics were used in the study. It is shown that the right to health protection among the basic social rights of a person and a citizen primarily reflects the introduction of technological information systems.

Yet, there still exists a lack of software engineering experience and best practices in this field. One such best practice, static code analysis, can be used to find code smells, i.e., (potential) defects in the source code, refactoring opportunities, and violations of common coding standards. Our research set out to discover the most prevalent code smells in ML projects. We gathered a dataset of 74 open-source ML projects, installed their dependencies and ran Pylint on them. This resulted in a top 20 of all detected code smells, per category. Manual analysis of these smells mainly showed that code duplication is widespread and that the PEP8 convention for identifier naming style may not always be applicable to ML code due to its resemblance with mathematical notation. More interestingly, however, we found several major obstructions to the maintainability and reproducibility of ML projects, primarily related to the dependency management of Python projects. We also found that Pylint cannot reliably check for correct usage of imported dependencies, including prominent ML libraries such as PyTorch.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This paper surveys opportunities to improve how corporations govern their AI activities so as to better advance the public interest. The paper focuses on the roles of and opportunities for a wide range of actors inside the corporation—managers, workers, and investors—and outside the corporation—corporate partners and competitors, industry consortia, nonprofit organizations, the public, the media, and governments. Whereas prior work on multistakeholder AI governance has proposed dedicated institutions to bring together diverse actors and stakeholders, this paper explores the opportunities they have even in the absence of dedicated multistakeholder institutions. The paper illustrates these opportunities with many cases, including the participation of Google in the U.S. Department of Defense Project Maven; the publication of potentially harmful AI research by OpenAI, with input from the Partnership on AI; and the sale of facial recognition technology to law enforcement by corporations including Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft. These and other cases demonstrate the wide range of mechanisms to advance AI corporate governance in the public interest, especially when diverse actors work together. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Edge computing, especially multiaccess edge computing, is seen as a promising technology to improve the Quality of user Experience (QoE) of many artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the evolution toward Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure. However, the management and deployment of massive edge data centers bring new challenges for the current network. In this article, we propose a new edge-based IoT platform for AI (EBI-PAI), based on software-defined network (SDN) and serverless technology. EBI-PAI provides a unified service calling interface and schedules the resources automatically to satisfy the QoE requirements of users. To optimize performances during incremental deployment, we formulate the deployment problem, prove its complexity, and design heuristic algorithms to solve it. We implement EBI-PAI based on an opensource serverless project and deploy it in real networks. To evaluate EBI-PAI, we conduct comprehensive simulations based on the generated and real-world network topology, and real-world base station data set. The simulation results show that EBI-PAI can greatly improve QoE with the same budget and save the budget to achieve similar QoE. We finally carry out a case study with real user demands, and it further validates the simulation results.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools have been gaining popularity to automate, monitor and visualize the security posture of multi-cloud environments. The foundation to assess the risk lies on being able to analyze each vulnerability and quantify its risk. However, the number of vulnerabilities in National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has skyrocketed in recent years and surpassed 144K as of late 2020. The current standard vulnerability tracking system relies mostly on human-driven efforts. Besides, open-source libraries do not necessarily follow the standards of vulnerability reporting set by CVE and NIST, but rather use Github issues for reporting. In this paper, we propose a framework, NL2Vul, to measure score of vulnerabilities with minimal human efforts. NL2Vul makes use of deep neural networks to train on descriptions of software vulnerabilities from NVD and predicts vulnerability scores. To flexibly expand the trained NVD model for different data sources that are being used to evaluate the risk posture in CSPM, NL2Vul uses transfer learning for quick re-Training. We have evaluated NL2Vul with vanilla NVD, public Github issues of open source projects, and compliance technology specification documents.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Digital Therapeutics (DTx) focused on the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic diseases are promising in alleviating the personal socio-economic burden caused. In this paper we describe a proposed DTx methodology covering three main components: observation (which data is collected), understanding (how to acquire knowledge based on the data collected), and coaching (how to communicate the acquired knowledge to the user). We focus on an emerging form of automated virtual coaching, delivered through conversational agents allowing interaction with end-users using natural language. Our methodology will be applied in the new generation of the Healthentia platform, an eClinical solution that captures clinical outcomes from mobile, medical and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, using a patient-centric mobile application and offers Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven smart services. While we are unable to provide data to prove its effectiveness, we illustrate the potential of the proposed architecture to deliver DTx by describing how the methodology can be applied to a use-case consisting of a clinical trial for treatment of a chronic condition, combining testing of a new medication and a lifestyle intervention, which will be partly implemented and evaluated in the context of the European research project RE-SAMPLE (REal-time data monitoring for Shared, Adaptive, Multi-domain and Personalised prediction, and decision making for Long-term Pulmonary care Ecosystems).

Green buildings have often involved the implementation of different success factors by construction professionals such as designers, project managers, contractors and quantity surveyors in order to overcome the difficulties and to ensure success in the delivery of green buildings. For instance, integration in the project delivery process enables the project participants to interact seamlessly to achieve better sustainable outcomes. Greater communication among project participants, particularly through multiple communication means contribute to success in the delivery of green buildings. It is found that various techniques of Artificial Intelligence have effectively contributed to the modernising of the construction industry through more reliable, automated, self-modifying, time-saving, and cost-effective process in construction management. Hence, this paper intends to bring in literature synthesis addressing applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques to enhance green construction through overcoming the barriers and issues in communication within green construction. Ultimately a conceptual framework is developed to understand the applicability of the AI in communication in green construction. © IEOM Society International.},

Since most AI methods, especially machine learning, require comprehensive sets of historical data, the benefits of applying AI to project management (PM) seem to be hardly worthwhile. Based on existing solutions in theory and practice as well as the results of an explorative interview study in Germany, this article shows that AI can nevertheless make a valuable contribution to improving PM. For this purpose, we present a framework that defines the fundamental concepts for applying AI to PM comprising both the requirements of AI for the application domain PM as well as the requirements of PM for the solution domain AI. Considering the two domains' mutual requirements, the framework structures the potential for the application of AI in PM and thus supports a targeted solution design for business.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In a survey, a group of project management experts were asked to state their insights into AI’s likely effect on project management in the next 10 years. Results clearly illustrated that AI will be an integrated part of future project management practice and will affect project management knowledge areas in the near future. According to these findings, the management of cost, schedule, and risk, in particular, will be highly affected by AI. The research indicates that AI is very useful for processes where historical data is available and can be used for estimation and planning. In addition, it is clear that AI can monitor schedules, adjust forecasts, and maintain baselines. According to the findings, AI will have less impact in knowledge areas and processes that require human leadership skills, such as developing and managing teams and the management of stakeholders. The results indicate proprietarily the project management knowledge areas as defined by PMI that AI is likely to augment and sustain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In the new H2020 project, WatchPlant will provide new tools for environmental intelligence monitoring by the use of plants as "well-being"sensors of the environment they inhabit. This will be possible by equipping plants with a net of communicated wireless self-powered sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) to become plants into "biohybrid organisms"to test exposure-effects links between plant and the environment. It will become plants into a new tool to be aware of the environment status in a very early stage towards in-situ monitoring. Additionally, the system is devoted to be sustainable and energy-efficient thanks to the use of clean energy sources such as solar cells and a enzymatic biofuel cell (BFC) together with its self-deployment, self-awareness, adaptation, artificial evolution and the AI capabilities.

However, the intrinsic diversity of vertical services, together with the heterogeneity of mobile infrastructure resources, poses severe management challenges that demand deep architectural innovations to seamlessly support enhanced orchestration mechanisms based on automation, flexibility, and programmability. In this paper, we present a novel management and orchestration platform for network slices devised by the H2020 MonB5G project. The presented concept addresses the scalability of network slicing management and orchestration by using a distributed and programmable management architecture that is AI-driven. AI-enabled management operations are adopted at different levels of the management hierarchy. The proposed architecture is a significant step towards self-managed network slices. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years the constant development of diagnostic techniques has contributed to improving the prognosis of many diseases. Among all, oncological diseases remain those in which a correct and early diagnosis can not only significantly improve the patient’s quality of life but also impact the effectiveness of the therapy itself. Artificial Intelligence can provide valuable aid to this need through the development of predictive models to support the physicians in the diagnosis of the disease. The project “Synergy-Net: Research and Digital Solutions in the Fight Against Oncological Diseases”, born from the collaboration between the Department of Medical and Advanced Surgical Sciences of the University of Campania “L. Vanvitelli”, the National Informatics Inter-University Consortium (National Informatics Inter-University Consortium), Lab ITEM “C. Savy” and Bollino IT S.p.A., aims at the realisation of a technological platform to support the early oncological diagnosis based on the integration of an interoperable communication and clinical data management system leveraging AI. The project has a deeply interdisciplinary nature (lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal carcinomas, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer and malignant skin tumours), which requires the collaboration of very different professionals, including general practitioners, specialist doctors, radiologists, surgeons, pathologists, molecular biologists and oncologists, as well as the support of a team of researchers for aspects related to machine learning and expert system development in health care. The core of the project consists in the creation of a Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis) system that, based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, assists the operator in the analysis of screening data such as anamnestic information, blood tests, instrumental and diagnostic images. The assistance to the operator is achieved by suggesting the portions of information (e.g. regions in an X-ray image) on which to focus more attention. The use of the system will help the physician in the development of increasingly personalised diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, meeting the criteria of tailored therapy/surgery, a desirable objective of any cancer prevention program. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Bottlenecks limit value streams, extend lead times and thus cause high costs. ADaM24 provides a new approach to bottleneck problems by offering Advanced Data Management over 24 h for individual and organizational learning to eliminate bottlenecks (Langer et al. 2021). The basic principle to this new approach is to determine a standard day by recording it in minute intervals which are averaged over a longer period of time. When ADaM24 is deployed at a company, it reveals six previously undiscovered and characteristic patterns of waste. These are MURA patterns of human-machine interaction, which we call “ProductionCultural Biorhythm” or PCB due to their company-related specificity. Patterns and the expression PCB were first established by Langer et al. (2021) [1] and can be demonstrated across different industries and company sizes. The processes measured at companies show that the maximum possible capacity is actually never used, in particular at bottlenecks. ADaM24’s clear and easy to grasp graphical representations open up new opportunities for learning about how to make desirable behavioral changes. Moreover, it provides managers with new intervention options. Now time slots within 24 h can be selected for optimization projects, during which not only the radicality of an intervention, but also its improvement dynamics and implementation stability can be measured. Overall, the PCB topology offers a wealth of new approaches, such as the integration of AI or even the ability to continuously identify bottlenecks “now and next” in dynamic value streams. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {How will AI affect OR practice? In OR we aspire to be logical, and therefore our behaviours should be relatively easy to replicate in logic, the basis of computer systems. We also pride ourselves on our attention to context, our project management skills, and our pragmatic approach. To think about the issues, we can turn to our experience of practicing OR and to the insights of mathematics, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Mathematicians and philosophers have widened the scope of logic to cover many aspects of decision-making; sociologists have conducted research into the social context and consequences of new technologies and economists have analysed their rates of penetration. Some OR jobs will be destroyed and others will be created giving rise to new, more varied career paths. The paper concludes that the centre of gravity of OR practice will move from analysis to those aspects difficult to computerise, the ‘residuals’. When AI does finally displace OR practitioners, it may come in the form of ‘AI strong enough for OR’, strong enough to satisfy potential OR clients in terms of efficacy and cost. The OR community needs to get involved more deeply in AI; it has the relevant expertise to do so. © The Operational Research Society 2020.},

One of these contexts is the medical domain, as these algorithms can support disease detection, image segmentation and other multiple tasks. However, it is necessary to organize and arrange the different data resources involved in these scenarios and tackle the heterogeneity of data sources. This work presents the CARTIER-IA platform: a platform for the management of medical data and imaging. The goal of this project focuses on providing a friendly and usable interface to organize structured data, to visualize and edit medical images, and to apply Artificial Intelligence algorithms on the stored resources. One of the challenges of the platform design is to ease these complex tasks in a way that non-AI-specialized users could benefit from the application of AI algorithms without further training. Two use cases of AI application within the platform are provided, as well as a heuristic evaluation to assess the usability of the first version of CARTIER-IA. © 2021, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Hence, a key challenge for organizations these days is to implement procedures that can be used to assess and mitigate the risks of organizational AI use. Although public awareness of AI-related risks is growing, the extant literature provides limited guidance to organizations on how to assess and manage AI risks. Against this background, we conducted an Action Design Research project in collaboration with a government agency with a pioneering AI practice to iteratively build, implement, and evaluate the Artificial Intelligence Risk Assessment (AIRA) tool. Besides the theory-ingrained and empirically evaluated AIRA tool, our key contribution is a set of five design principles for instantiating further instances of this class of artifacts. In comparison to existing AI risk assessment tools, our work emphasizes communication between stakeholders of diverse expertise, estimating the expected real-world positive and negative consequences of AI use, and incorporating performance metrics beyond predictive accuracy, including thus assessments of privacy, fairness, and interpretability. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Considering a multiplicity of challenges towards realizing an effective network slice management in modern 5G networks, our work considers explicitly the context promoted by the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) framework, assessed as an indispensable part of next-generation management systems. MonB5G focuses upon the provision of scalable and automated management and orchestration of high numbers of parallel network slices, as envisioned in 5G and beyond. Within this scope, we propose a detailed architecture composed of static and dynamically deployed components. Altogether, they support operations related to slicing orchestration, fault management (self-healing), self-configuration, performance optimization (including energy saving), and security-related operations of slices. In the paper, we identified each separate architectural layer and explained all involved modules and interfaces. The proposed framework is able to support the deployment of a massive number of slices in different administrative and technological domains. Furthermore, the potential extensions and/or enhancements of the architecture are also proposed and assessed. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

Demographic and social transition is reducing the availability of volunteer personnel, and increasing traffic congestion in cities is resulting in longer travel times for emergency vehicles. This paper presents the findings of the definition phase of a research project that addresses these changes. It shows the basic idea of how resilience of fire and ambulance services can be improved by analyzing operational data from past incidents using artificial intelligence (AI). The primary objective is the development of a decision support system for control center dispatchers, which ensures optimal use of available resources. As the result of the definition phase, this paper gives an overview of existing data, current as well as future use cases and also highlights risks and challenges that have to be considered. © 2020 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

A smart scheduling solution proposed herein relies on a combination of optimization methods including constraint programming and mixed-integer linear programming. The method employs model-based AI, heuristic methods and discrete-event simulation to efficiently schedule project tasks while handling precedence constraints, resource constraints (labor, equipment) and capacity constraints. The present study investigated the key challenge of managing geospatial constraints. A new solution is presented that captures in a generic fashion the geospatial relationships of work areas and that analyses schedules to detect proximity and path-based conflicts occurring over the course of the project plan. A visualization support tool was designed that generates an abstract 3D model to help intuitively understand and contextualize detected conflicts. Solution effectiveness was assessed and validated using a test scenario. The resulting method is deemed applicable to a broad range of domains. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Especially the outbreak of COVID-19 has pushed AI to an unprecedented peak. On the face of it, received wisdom has it that AI is positive and powerful, for example, AI can handle tedious and repetitive tasks more efficiently, control the risk more effectively, help people make decisions more intelligently. However, not each AI projects can achieve success. It is reported that 85% of AI projects confront the failure results [1]. Considering the root cause, a large number of articles explained that it attributes to the data, algorithms, and lack of support from management. This article, through investigating the performance of China Construction Bank's unmanned banking project, objectively analyzes the failure reasons which would be faced by the Chinese banking industry and general AI projects from a different point of views, including the policies of regulators, targeted users, the essential limitation of the technology, business goal and project costs, to help them comprehensively understand the risks and shortcomings of implementing an AI application. Finally, the article turns to propose some improvement suggestions to try to eliminate those failures. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {The promise of disparate features envisioned by the 3GPP for 5G, such as offering enhanced Mobile Broadband connectivity while providing massive Machine Type Communications likely with very low data rates and maintaining Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications requirements, create a very challenging environment for protecting the 5G networks themselves and associated assets. To overcome such complexity, future 5G networks must employ a very high degree of network and service management automation, which is a security challenge by itself as well as an opportunity for smarter and more efficient security functions. In this paper, we present the smart, trustworthy and liable 5G security platform being designed and developed in the INSPIRE-5Gplus1 project. This platform takes advantage of new techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), network softwarization and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for closed-loop and end-to-end security management following a zero-touch model in 5G and Beyond 5G networks. To this end, we specifically elaborate on two key aspects of our platform, namely security management with Security Service Level Agreements (SSLAs) and liability management, in addition to the description of the overall architecture. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

It acts as an interface between the highly intermittent renewable energy resource such as solar photovoltaic or wind energy system, the load, such as residential homes and businesses, electric vehicle fleets and the electric power grid. In principle, battery storage is intended to store excess electricity production from the renewable resource. The energy stored is then typically discharged in the evening when demand is higher, or sold to the grid when the available electricity is higher than the demand. However, the implementation of such a system becomes more complicated when taking into account the stochastic nature of the renewables, the variations of the load demand and the electric vehicle availability. In this project, a fuzzy logic management system, optimized through genetic algorithm process, is proposed. It seeks to obtain a fully functional microgrid that minimizes electricity consumption from the utility grid, while offering ancillary services to the grid such as peak shaving. These objectives are accomplished by maximizing the energy input from the renewables and optimizing the utilization of the energy storage system. Finally, the microgrid’s control main objective is to maintain a constant voltage at the DC bus under all operating conditions. Initial simulations and experimental data show some promising results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a discipline that is increasingly growing hand in hand with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning enabling the so-called cognitive automation. In such context, the existing RPA platforms that include AI-based solutions classify their components, i.e. constituting part of a robot that performs a set of actions, in a way that seems to obey market or business decisions instead of common-sense rules. To be more precise, components that present similar functionality are identified with different names and grouped in different ways depending on the platform that provides the components. Therefore, the analysis of different cognitive RPA platforms to check their suitability for facing a specific need is typically a time-consuming and error-prone task. To overcome this problem and to provide users with support in the development of an RPA project, this paper proposes a method for the systematic construction of a taxonomy of cognitive RPA components. Moreover, such a method is applied over components that solve selected real-world use cases from the industry obtaining promising results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In contrast to mainstream centralized artificial intelligence (AI) allowing algorithmic discrimination and manipulative nudging, the decentralized approach of collective learning is by-design participatory and value-sensitive: it aligns with privacy, autonomy, fairness and democratic values. Engineering such values in a socio-technical system results in computational constraints that turn collective decision-making into complex combinatorial NP-hard problems. These are the problems that collective learning and the EPOS research project tackles. Collective learning finds striking applicability in energy, traffic, supply-chain and the self-management of sharing economies. This grand applicability and the social impact are demonstrated in this paper along with a future perspective of the collective learning paradigm.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, neural networks have shown impressive performance gains on long-standing AI problems, such as answering queries from text and machine translation. These advances raise the question of whether neural nets can be used at the core of query processing to derive answers from facts, even when the facts are expressed in natural language. If so, it is conceivable that we could relax the fundamental assumption of database management, namely, that our data is represented as fields of a pre-defined schema. Furthermore, such technology would enable combining information from text, images, and structured data seamlessly. This paper introduces neural databases, a class of systems that use NLP transformers as localized answer derivation engines. We ground the vision in NeuralDB, a system for querying facts represented as short natural language sentences. We demonstrate that recent natural language processing models, specifically transformers, can answer select-project-join queries if they are given a set of relevant facts. However, they cannot scale to non-trivial databases nor answer set-based and aggregation queries. Based on these insights, we identify specific research challenges that are needed to build neural databases. Some of the challenges require drawing upon the rich literature in data management, and others pose new research opportunities to the NLP community. Finally, we show that with preliminary solutions, NeuralDB can already answer queries over thousands of sentences with very high accuracy. © is held by the owner/author(s).},

Monitoring the farm for disease detection is labor intensive and time consuming. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), we are able to detect plant diseases more efficiently. Existing AI and IoT studies detect plant diseases by images or nonimage hyperspectral data, which require manual operations to obtain the photographs or data for analysis. Also, image detection typically is too late as rice blast may already spread to other plants. Based on an IoT platform for soil cultivation, we develop the RiceTalk project that utilizes nonimage IoT devices to detect rice blast. Unlike the image-based plant disease detection approaches, our agriculture sensors generate nonimage data that can be automatically trained and analyzed by the AI mechanism in real time. The beauty of RiceTalk is that the AI model is treated as an IoT device and is managed like other IoT devices. In this way, our approach significantly reduces the platform management cost to provide real-time training and predictions. We also propose an innovative spore germination mechanism as a new feature extraction model for agriculture. In the current implementation, the accuracy of the RiceTalk prediction on rice blast is 89.4%. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Estimate schedule to completion (ESTC) is a difficult variable to determine accurately during the various phases of construction projects due to the complex, uncertain, and limited nature of currently available information. Currently, most construction managers estimate this variable using their subjective prior experience with budget planning. However, this method is costly and highly prone to inaccuracy. The study developed a novel inference model, the neural network-long short-term memory (NN-LSTM) model, to estimate ESTC accurately by factoring in the sequence and nonsequence factors that significantly influence project duration and that capture the inherent uncertainties in the construction field. NN-LSTM fuses two characteristics of artificial neural networks (ANNs): feedforward neural networks (FNNs) for nonsequential issue, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential issue. After a systematic review of the literature, brainstorming, and in-depth interviews with domain experts, a database of 226 historical cases collected from 11 construction projects with 14 influencing factors was created for learning purposes, with 10-fold cross validation used to partition the training and testing data sets. NN-LSTM was then applied to estimate the schedule to completion for the historical cases, with FNN capturing the impact of time-independent factors on project duration and LSTM capturing the long temporal dependency for sequential inputs. The learning results indicated good performance, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 5% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2%, proving the NN-LSTM model to be more reliable than the currently prevailing earned value management (EVM) formulas. Moreover, in subsequent comparison testing NN-LSTM proved to be superior to other artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models. The model has the ability to generate reliable scheduling estimates for project managers in order to facilitate their accurate planning and the monitoring of the time performance of projects, allowing timely action to be taken to remedy foreseen delays and facilitating informed decision-making. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent across various industries. However, the construction industry and its suppliers have not yet recognized its full potential as it relates to efficiency and competitiveness. This study aims to increase the understanding of AI in the environment of construction by presenting a case applying tools referring to the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) and Six Sigma to show how to implement selected AI technologies in a systematic way in order to improve processes. Thus, this paper presents a novel approach for solving business process and management problems combining TRIZ and Six Sigma tools. We specifically focus on extending TRIZ with Six Sigma. To demonstrate the successful application of the developed TRIZ-Six Sigma framework a case study is included. Overall, this paper provides an illustrative example of successful systematic innovation and demonstrates how AI technology can be implemented within a real company by identifying the use of cases with the support of TRIZ.

We propose a semi-interactive course where the students have to develop applications for solving real world problems by using various intelligent tools. We try to integrate these two disciplines, since both deal with modeling of the real case studies, sharing some common elements. We report on a study that we conducted on observing student teams as they develop AI-based applications. We validate the proposed semi-interactive course by using various criteria. In addition, we checked if some best practices from industrial teams are followed by our students.; The current study presents the experience gained while introducing a course with two main purposes: i) use of AI methods and algorithms in solving real life problems and ii) integrate AI specific solutions in software systems. We explained the principle in designing the course content, with a special attention dedicated to the applicative part. We described in detail how the application stages interleaves AI tasks (model representation, training, statistical analysis) with SE tasks (requirements engineering, SE processes, project management). In the end, we give an overview of the course evaluation.

	abstract = {Background: Fuel is the most important source of energy essential for humanity. It plays a vital role in the economy of a country. Dependency on non-renewable resources like petroleum brings about manipulation of the oil market and an increase in the price of these resources. Excessive use of non-renewable resources leads to global warming. These resources exist in a finite quantity in nature, which makes renewable resources appealing. Objective: Petroleum being a non-renewable energy mode requires monitoring and dynamic pricing based upon the consumption to reduce excessive usage. This dynamic price control on the basis of consumption developed upon the rules of Novel algorithm for resource allocation in the system will orient the end user to move towards developing alternate resources for power generation in the field of renewable energy like wind, hydro, solar, etc. This orientation is one of the key steps for developing a smart city with efficient resource allocation as the key factor of development. Methods: In order to manage resources efficiently, the following processes are incorporated. Provide End-user a unique ID card (Named as Tra-Card). Develop data of usage (Fuel, Health Resources, and Supply Chain Management) for initial days. Automated Management of Resources using Novel Framework Algorithm with fuzzy based stable marriage algorithm). Develop Customer Management Policy as per the criterion set by governments. Generate Data and rules for use at individual points of work. Results: The process will help the government make efficient policies and produce real time deliverables over complete control and handling of fuel management; the most important of human life need. This will also allow government’s to provide a solution for end to end charging by making fuel an item of luxury and taxing the people who use it as a luxury product. Discussion: Fuel being primary requisite for human survival needs strict monitoring for irregular usage and laundering. As, the fuel has become an item of luxury for few and item for survival of few “it must be taxed as per the usage” of end-user. The Data is experimental and developed using a multiplication factor α which is multiplied to the base fuel price once it crosses a certain range of Kilometer travelled by the user with his car. Conclusion: The model proposed in the paper captures the necessity of development of an efficient method that considers the finiteness of fossil fuels by monitoring the distribution of fuel and its consumption. The purpose of this project is to save energy with aim of AI Engine managed logistics and goal of creating Energy-Efficient survival of the human species. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

The paper presents a full system architecture to assess the hazardous situations resulting from CBRN materials. This issue is crucial since there were a number of incidents that occurred in which forensics people could not reach the location either due to being unreachable or due to harmful emissions. The proposed solution integrates various inputs including data from sensors, video streaming, geo-data along with using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for good decision-making and data analysis. A geo-dashboard was also designed to demonstrate, in real-time, the collected data from several angles and according to various queries. It also monitors the performance in real-time. The topic is not new however the novelty of the proposed solution is the integration of multiple sources of data, applying deep neural nets and projecting the data and data analytics in real-time on a dashboard that displays the analysis and data from different perspectives considering the viewpoint of the individuals who will use that system.

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a pressing need to manage high-dimensional vector data in data science and AI applications. This trend is fueled by the proliferation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML), where ML models usually transform unstructured data into feature vectors for data analytics, e.g., product recommendation. Existing systems and algorithms for managing vector data have two limitations: (1) They incur serious performance issue when handling large-scale and dynamic vector data; and (2) They provide limited functionalities that cannot meet the requirements of versatile applications. This paper presents Milvus, a purpose-built data management system to efficiently manage large-scale vector data. Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs); optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs; enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search; handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing; and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities. Now Milvus is deployed by hundreds of organizations worldwide and it is also recognized as an incubation-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation.

	abstract = {Recent changes in the dynamic characteristics of security and emergency management requirements have a big impact on the development of more effective security systems. Innovative solutions have to provide support for new security challenges and newly developed operational strategies. Widely used security concepts based on video sensor solutions are being replaced by high-performance multi-sensor systems, which allow monitoring of outdoor areas with various sizes independent of lighting and weather conditions. Apart from the sensors used, the system effectiveness depends on innovative automatic data analysis including AI methods to enable generation of a comprehensive near real-time representation of a given situation. This work describes a concept and an experimental prototype of a self-sufficient, independent multi-sensor system for monitoring of critical personal behavior in the context of events, border area surveillance and critical infrastructure monitoring. The specific security scenarios were defined and worked out in detail in close cooperation with security experts. In order to ensure 24/7 operational capability, the work focuses on a flexible sensor platform concept and includes optical, thermal and radar sensors which are synergistically employed. Furthermore, innovative approaches to multi-sensor AI-based data analysis and web-based mobile information management solutions were developed as part of the nationally funded research project WatchDog to enable a targeted, scenario oriented support of the security forces. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In collaborative research projects, both researchers and practitioners work together solving business-critical challenges. These projects often deal with ETL processes, in which humans extract information from non-machine-readable documents by hand. AI-based machine learning models can help to solve this problem. Since machine learning approaches are not deterministic, their quality of output may decrease over time. This fact leads to an overall quality loss of the application which embeds machine learning models. Hence, the software qualities in development and production may differ. Machine learning models are black boxes. That makes practitioners skeptical and increases the inhibition threshold for early productive use of research prototypes. Continuous monitoring of software quality in production offers an early response capability on quality loss and encourages the use of machine learning approaches. Furthermore, experts have to ensure that they integrate possible new inputs into the model training as quickly as possible. In this paper, we introduce an architecture pattern with a reference implementation that extends the concept of Metrics Driven Research Collaboration with an automated software quality monitoring in productive use and a possibility to auto-generate new test data coming from processed documents in production. Through automated monitoring of the software quality and auto-generated test data, this approach ensures that the software quality meets and keeps requested thresholds in productive use, even during further continuous deployment and changing input data.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has quickly evolved from automating simple rule-based tasks. Nowadays, RPA is required to mimic more sophisticated human tasks, thus implying its combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, i.e., the so-called intelligent RPA. Putting together RPA with AI leads to a challenging scenario since (1) it involves professionals from both fields who typically have different skills and backgrounds, and (2) AI models tend to degrade over time which affects the performance of the overall solution. This paper describes the AIRPA project, which addresses these challenges by proposing a software architecture that enables (1) the abstraction of the robot development from the AI development and (2) the monitor, control, and maintain intelligent RPA developments to ensure its quality and performance over time. The project has been conducted in the Servinform context, a Spanish consultancy firm, and the proposed prototype has been validated with reality settings. The initial experiences yield promising results in reducing AHT (Average Handle Time) in processes where AIRPA deployed cognitive robots, which encourages exploring the support of intelligent RPA development. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Construction architectures draw a new world pattern. Designing innovative shapes and their building cost a fortune and investors expect the relevant return in money and population benefits. Some of the representative examples of expensive constructive creativity are wide highways, bridges, skyscrapers, grand halls, malls, tall flats, etc. Each newly started or finalized construction must operate with a smart fault-tolerant risk management mechanism because the world has been a witness of many construction failures. They lead to additional reversible and irreversible damages, some of which cost people's lives. In 2018 the road viaduct in Genoa collapsed. As a result of the tragedy, at least thirty-eight people died, thirty-five cars and three trucks fall. In the basement of that collapse are a wrong construction project, the neglected need for reconstruction and the lack of a system to inform citizens about the bridge condition. Such accidents bear the question of how to prevent similar situations in advanced. Bridge engineering is difficult for standardization, therefore there is a need for a new technique to handle the issue. The authors of the report examine the way modern information and communication technologies impact quality control. The researchers make a relevant scientific literature review. They explore qualitative, quantitative and statistical methods of evaluation and apply computer comparison and modelling to create a new form for measuring and controlling the quality and strength of bridges. The new model introduces an AI governor for bridge management and a self-learning machine to adapt existing construction standards and to create new ones according to the situation and environmental conditions. The proposed solution incorporates real-time data analyses. © 2020 ACM.},

Despite the effort of government, however, it has trouble in initial diffusion for reasons of extant anxiety about cloud such as security issues, burden of initial construction and maintenance expenses, and in addition to this, it is not easy to invigorate due to various regulations and systems of individual laws that hinder the introduction of cloud. Also in national defense field, it continues to make efforts such as preparing guidelines to preferentially examine cloud when introducing, moving and transferring military information systems according to the government policy, performing studies to apply cloud, and carrying out pilot projects, but it seemed the practical application process is not easy due to a lot of limitations such as task characteristics and each military information system operation diversity.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the possible future evolution of innovation from a human-only initiative, to human–machine co-innovation, to autonomous machine innovation and to arrive at a conceptual mind model that outlines the role of innovation regimes and innovation agents. Design/methodology/approach: This is a concept paper where a theoretical “thought experiment” is done, using future thinking principles and data that originate from the literature. Findings: A conceptual mind model is developed to facilitate a better understanding of complexity at the edge of innovation where intelligent machines will emerge as innovators of the cyber world. It was found that innovation will gradually evolve from a human-only activity, to human–machine co-innovation, to incidences of autonomous machine innovation, based on the growth of machine intelligence and the adoption of human–machine partnership management models in future. Research limitations/implications: Very little information is available in the literature on intelligent machines doing innovation. The work is based on a theoretical approach that presents new concepts to be debated, but have not been tested in engineering and technology management practice, except for a conference presentation and academic discussion. Practical implications: The current world view is that future “smartness” is only possible through the creative abilities that humans have, but as machines are entering the workplace and our daily lives, not only as static robots on a manufacturing line, but as intelligent systems with the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, doctors and teachers, companions and partners, their role in innovation in complex environments needs to be explored. Social implications: Human–machine interaction is often an emotional social issue of concern in terms of the replacement of human intelligence with machine intelligence. It should be asked whether humans will or should remain in control of innovation? Artificial intelligence (AI) may complement and even substitute human intelligence, but huge value is embedded in the new goods, services and innovations AI will enable, especially in manufacturing, where value embedded in the project becomes complex and dynamic. Originality/value: The thinking presented in this paper is original and should lead to debate to question the way innovation systems will work in future and inspires thinking about AI and innovation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The project addresses the critical issues that we have identified as hampering the deployment of AI on electric grid measurements. These issues have stymied the potential for insight from high resolution grid measurements and generally hindered artificial intelligence innovation in the utility industry. The project consists of three main components. The first is the deployment of a diverse set of grid sensors to capture a variety of grid behaviour, both from the field and in simulation. The second is the deployment of a highly performant, scalable, cloud-based data management and AI platform designed for time series data to enable the easy storage, processing and analysis of grid sensor data. The third is the cultivation of an open research community of experts around the platform and data through useful educational material, code and data sharing, and data science competitions. Overall, the project will accelerate the development of analytics, machine learning, and AI by addressing existing gaps in data, tools, and people, with the aim of improving the electric grid. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, in domains with an unintuitive problem-solution-fit, such as project management (PM), organizations require methodological guidance. Hence, we propose a five-step method to develop organization-specific AI use cases: First, companies must consider the context factors technology, organization (in particular data and application domain), and environment. Second, companies must identify existing domain problems and AI solutions. Third, our method facilitates abstraction to understand the underlying nature of the identified problems and AI solutions. Fourth, our problem-solution-matrix assists companies to match AI functions with the domain context. Fifth, companies derive necessary implications for the subsequent use case implementation. To construct and evaluate our method, we followed the design science research paradigm complemented by situational method engineering and based on 14 interviews. Our method addresses a relevant practical problem and contributes to identifying purposeful AI use cases in unintuitive application domains. © Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Business Information Systems 2020 "Developments, Opportunities and Challenges of Digitization", WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK 2020.},

	abstract = {The recent past has advocated immense flexibility in the control and elasticity in the resources of the mobile networks. The emerging application domains including autonomous driving, eHealth, smart grid, etc. position the need for the right communication stretch at a pivotal level. It goes without saying that the network operators will experience the dynamic demands like never before owing to an extremely dynamic device layer i.e., IoT. An obvious consequence of this is the uncertainty in the demand estimation and capacity planning of the communication infrastructure. This paper studies the concept of dynamic demand estimation using AI approaches. We start with learning over the mobility and activity patterns of a single user and evaluate the performance of different machine learning (ML) approaches, for example, classification, regression, and clustering. We then move on to more realistic settings, where the learning is carried out for population and autonomous driving. To do so, we use the data-set from Ernst-Reuter-Platz collected as part a Berlin City project that made the data openly available. © 2020 IEEE.},

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In addition, it investigates the correlation between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and AI in HRM processes. A survey was conducted with a sample of 310 firm members in the HR Section Romande, as well as a literature review on the adoption of new technologies. The results indicate a perceived positive value of introducing AI in HRM and a correlation between the level of a company`s EO and the introduction of AI in HRM. This means that the more a company is entrepreneurially oriented, the more it tends to implement or include already implemented AI projects and tools in HRMprocesses. The perceived value of AI in HRM was evaluated by comparing answers to research questions involving the introduction of AI in HRM tools, and expectations of widely implementing AI in the next five years. The main barrier of adopting AI in HRM appeared to be a lack of skills and training. In addition, potential features of implementing AI in HRM were identified as potential steps toward introducing AI as a new technology. Questions regarding the evaluation of EO were based on a research Colvin Slevin (1989). It is important for SMEs to invest in information technology to set the basis for further development. Owing to intensified competitive pressures and the necessity of entering global markets, SMEs are incrementally employing Information Technology (IT) to create substantial benefits. Most prior research has focused more on IT adoption in large organizations, yet when regarding the limited resources of SMEs, the IT adoption process is considerably different. © 2020 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) and digital transformation (DT), the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become valuable tools in the oil/gas industry. DT in oil/gas requires the marrying of physical technologies, such as smart sensors, and digital technologies, such as AI, edge computing/cloud-based platforms, which forms the basis for the IoT. The overall strategy for achieving DT in the drilling sector is to set a clear direction for change by not only requiring communication and coordination between the research and development (RD) units but also aligning with drilling engineering/operational stakeholder requirements. Drilling organizations stand to benefit from DT since a set of interlinked technologies, such as IoT, is not simply concerned with the cost savings due to its implementation, but more with the tremendous potential these technologies have in the future to significantly increase revenue generation efficiency and profits by performing tasks differently across a traditional industry such as drilling; laying platforms for integrating future technologies, and the ability to seamlessly connect and coordinate across silos. Implementing IoT has the potential to increase operational drilling efficiency by 5% and cut upstream operating expenditure by 20%-30%; both significant values in a multibillion-dollar industry. Moreover, the economic value creation in the oil/gas industry in the next seven years is projected to be trillions of dollars, and analysts at Nomura, a large Japanese financial holding company, believe the IoT could make oil/gas companies more profitable at 70/barrel than they were previously at 100/barrel.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.},

This study takes a traditional village protection project-the preservation of Zaoshi Village, Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, China-as a case in point. Treating the decision-making process as a system, the study employs ISM model to examine the system-level relationship between engineering projects. Artificial Intelligence is utilized for analyzing the planning of project structure and Fuzzy TOPSIS model is useful in estimating the weights of the scenario and find the ranking of structure finally. Then, using the analytical data thus derived, the research focuses on identifying the optimum option for decision-making. By this process, the study intends to gain and share some insight into the issue and establish precedents for similar engineering projects. © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with energy efficiency in buildings in order to mitigate the climate change. Buildings are the highest source of energy consumption worldwide. However, a large part of this energy is wasted, mainly due to poor buildings management. Therefore, being accurately informed about consumptions and detecting anomalies are essential steps to overcome this problem. Currently, some software exist to typically record, store, archive, and visualize big data such as the ones of a building, a campus, or a city. Yet, they do not provide Artificial Intelligence (AI) able to automatically analyze the streaming data to detect anomalies and send alerts, as well as adapted reports to the different stakeholders. The system designed in the sandfox project has for objective to fill this gap. To improve the energy management, an innovative system should aim at visualizing the streaming data, editing reports, and detecting anomalies, for different stakeholders, such as policy makers, energy managers, researchers, technical staff or end-users of these buildings. The paper presents the User-Centred Design approach that was used to collect the required needs from different stakeholders. The developed AI system is called sandman (semi-Supervised ANomaly Detection with Multi-AgeNt systems). It processes data in a time constrained manner to detect anomalies as early as possible. sandman is based on the paradigm of self-adaptive multi-agent systems. The results show the robustness of the AI regarding the detection of noisy data, of different types of anomalies, and the scaling. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We propose here a model based on microbanking, that is, the transformation of small business owners into managers of very small banks which provide microcredit to their communities. The idea is based on findings and learn-ings from a past project with Brazil’s largest micro-credit institution. Our proposal looks, in particular, into how AI technology can ethically mine the knowledge some people in those communities (e.g., small shop owners) have about the financial life and status of other members and leverage it to enable micro-loans to the whole community, supporting at the same time the small-business owners on credit and cash flow provisions.

	abstract = {5G mobile networks will be soon available to handle all types of applications and to provide service to massive numbers of users. In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, end-to-end performance analysis and optimization will be key features in order to effectively manage the diverse requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries over the same shared infrastructure. To enable such a vision, the MARSAL project [1] targets the development and evaluation of a complete framework for the management and orchestration of network resources in 5G and beyond by utilizing a converged optical-wireless network infrastructure in the access and fronthaul/midhaul segments. At the network design domain, MARSAL targets the development of novel cell-free-based solutions. Namely, scalable and cost-efficient wireless access points deployment will be achieved by exploiting the distributed cell-free concept combined with wireless and wired serial fronthaul approaches. We will target the inclusion of these innovative functionalities in the O-RAN project. In parallel, in the fronthaul/midhaul segments MARSAL aims to radically increase the flexibility of optical access architectures for Beyond-5G cell site connectivity via different levels of fixed-mobile convergence. In the network and service management domain, the design philosophy of MARSAL is to provide a comprehensive framework for the management of the entire set of communication and computational network resources by exploiting novel ML-based algorithms of both edge and midhaul data centers, by incorporating the Virtual Elastic Data Centers/Infrastructures paradigm. Finally, at the network security domain, MARSAL aims to introduce mechanisms that provide privacy and security to application workload and data, targeting to allow applications and users to maintain control over their data when relying on the deployed shared infrastructures, while AI and Blockchain technologies will be developed in order to guarantee a secured multi-tenant slicing environment. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the work is to evaluate the current changes in the structure of the national economic systems as a result of transition to intellectual technologies of managing production processes in various spheres of public life. The authors pay attention to specific features of development of the modern agriculture in the conditions of the growing threat of food deficit. The problem of growth of population of the Earth dictates the necessity for intensification of production of food products by the spheres of agriculture. The production areas are stable, so it is necessary to look for new innovative means of production, which allow for maximum reduction of the cost and increase of the volumes of the manufactured products. The course at informatization of all spheres of public life via implementation of digital tools and mechanisms is aimed at development of hidden potentials and reserves of the existing traditional means and solutions of the problems. Application of digital technologies allows for a new reproduction cycle, exclusion of irrational solutions, and more precise modeling of the tactic and strategy of development of the events. According to the set goal, the authors strive to solve the following tasks: assessment of the level of modern development of the Russian agricultural sphere in view of the tendencies of formation of the information society and information economy, which emphasizes the importance of modernizing the traditional sphere; distinguishing the main intellectual solutions of the problems of intensification of agricultural production; paying attention to absence of the normative and legal regulation; determining the directions of development of the Russian law; analyzing all stages of the agricultural cycle and determining the possibilities of rationalization of the whole process – from preparation to realization of finished products. Separate attempts of Russian farmers to implement new tools do not provide a significant effect – as there’s a need for systemic planning and state support for digitization. The work in this direction is conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, with a project of the state program “Digital agriculture” and a road map FoodNet (Smart agriculture) in development. Methodology: The authors use the methods of normative and legal analysis and evaluation of the modern situation in the sphere of state management of the national economic system, content analysis, statistical analysis, formalization, and analogy. Results: In view of transition to the Fourth industrial revolution, the traditional systems of interaction and organization of production lose their topicality and become uncompetitive. For increasing the competitiveness in the Russian and global markets, companies of various spheres have to observe the modern tendencies and perform modernization of the production basis and the system of management through implementation of technologies based on AI. The companies of the agricultural sphere perform a search and approbation of various intellectual technologies and receive positive results of their application – which influences the profitability level. The authors of this work perform an overview of the most popular technologies of intellectual management of production and make conclusions on the necessity of full-scale implementation of such systems. Conclusions: The specific feature of this work consists in systematization and complex substantiation of the current processes of implementation of AI technologies in the spheres of the agro-industrial complex. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

AI adoption has tripled in 2018, moving AI towards the Gartner-hype-cycle peak. As AI is getting more mainstream, more conservative companies have good reasons to enter this arena. My impression is that the journey is starting all over again as organizations start using AI technology as black box systems. I think that eventually these companies will also start asking for methods that result in more reliable project outcomes and integrated business systems. The idea that explainable AI is at the expense of accuracy is deeply rooted in the AI community. Unfortunately, this has hampered research into good explainable models and indicates that the human factor in AI is underestimated. Driven by governments asking for transparency, a public asking for unbiased decision making and compliance requirements on business and industry, a new trend and research area is emerging. This talk will explain why explainable artificial intelligence is needed, what makes an explanation good and how ontologies, rule-based systems and knowledge representation may contribute to the research area named XAI. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Companies all over the world are championing their latest progress with AI, machine learning and deep learning, even though most of it is far short of anything that could be described as a breakthrough. Unfortunately, this excitement does not always translate into quantifiable success — it can take up to six months to go from concept to production, and even then, only one in three AI projects turns out successful. These odds might be low, but the effort is well worth it as the potential payoff could be huge. This paper describes five different types of AI — sound, time series, text, image and video — and illustrates various ways that AI can be used, including in customer relationship management, e-commerce, customer recommendations, security, voice assistance and natural language processing for customer understanding. This article argues that AI will become the basis for a level of customer personalisation that will not only be recognised but soon be demanded by fickle customers everywhere. As the paper will show, it is imperative for brands to utilise AI in their marketing because it allows them to have both a single view of the customer as well as a single view of their media. © Henry Stewart Publications 2050-0076 (2020).},

The team includes complementary expertise in data- and knowledge-driven AI, data integration, telemedicine and decision support. The time is right to fully exploit Artificial Intelligence for cancer care and bring the benefits right to patients’ homes. CAPABLE relies on predictive models based on both retrospective and prospective data, integrated with computer interpretable guidelines and made available to oncologists. CAPABLE’s Virtual Coach component identifies unexpected needs and provides patient-specific decision support and lifestyle guidance to improve mental and physical wellbeing of patients. The demo, designed around a use-case scenario developed with clinicians involved in the project, addresses the ESMO Diarrhea guideline. It revolves around a prototypical fictional patient named Maria. Maria, 66, is affected by renal cell carcinoma and moderate insomnia. The demo follows Maria during the first three days of using the CAPABLE system. This allows the audience to understand the scope and innovation behind this AI-based decision-support and coaching system that personalizes lifestyle and medication interventions to patients, their carer and clinicians. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have evidenced their capacity to solve dynamic, uncertain and complex tasks. The aim of this current study is to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence model called integrative Random Forest classifier with Genetic Algorithm optimization (RF-GA) for delay problem prediction. At first, related sources and factors of delay problems are identified. A questionnaire is adopted to quantify the impact of delay sources on project performance. The developed hybrid model is trained using the collected data of the previous construction projects. The proposed RF-GA is validated against the classical version of an RF model using statistical performance measure indices. The achieved results of the developed hybrid RF-GA model revealed a good resultant performance in terms of accuracy, kappa and classification error. Based on the measured accuracy, kappa and classification error, RF-GA attained 91.67%, 87% and 8.33%, respectively. Overall, the proposed methodology indicated a robust and reliable technique for project delay prediction that is contributing to the construction project management monitoring and sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The lead author has in this decade been studying the processes of creating and transferring multinational IT service knowledge among the headquarters of a global IT Service firm in Japan and the firm’s local subsidiaries in China and APAC regions. Key findings of the preceding studies are, (1) the average of Project Managers’ skill level in China and APAC regions has already reached to the global average determined in the standardized PM skill assessment within the global firm. (2) IT service project managers’ value systems are highly influenced by those of organization the PMs belong to, and the value systems vary not only by nations but also by industries. (3) To transfer knowledge from HQ to overseas subsidiaries in China and APAC regions, especially in the case that the knowledge to be transferred is extremely new and unfamiliar to the knowledge transferees (i.e., local PMs), it is better for the knowledge transferrers from HQs to consider the differences between the value systems of the transferrer and the transferee. In this paper, the author describes the case-studies with interviews of service project managers in the IT service, aerospace, and construction industries who could use or avoid AI to use for their own projects and have opinions on the AI technology for them. And the author’s objective is to distinguish the applicable and non-applicable AI functions for professional service managers by evaluating the comments of the service project managers. Also, assuming similarity of the knowledge-creating process among project managers in a multinational environment to the process among human PMs and AIs, as the teaming with unfamiliar partners, the author introduced an extended SECI model to explain the needs for considering the sub-process to connect the major four processes in between “Ba”, the knowledge creating field in the SECI model. And referring to the updated technological information, the author considers the possible further research. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The results indicate that AI middle office can provide evidence support for stakeholders. Especially during the claim, AI middle office can define the accountability and analyze data when forecasting prices, thereby providing stakeholders with data support.

While the importance of applying such technologies has been widely recognized, they might not have been effectively discussed in the early design phase. As a widely applied planning and architecting tool, traditional Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) are not always able to meet requirements of urban development in an expected way. This might be alleviated by applying a smart city-oriented EAF which supports discussion of modern techniques in the early design phase. In the EU smart city project +CityxChange, an EAF was proposed to address such issues. In this article, we focus on an initial evaluation of the EAF proposed in the +CityxChange project according to the Design Science Research (DSR) method. We discuss how the EAF has enhanced the widely used EAF (i.e., The Open Group Architecture Framework, TOGAF for short) by extending its layer-based Enterprise Architecture (EA). We also present a sample scenario demonstrating how the EAF can be used. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The concepts of smart building (SB) and smart facilities management (SFM) are crucial as they aim to uplift occupants’ living standards through information and communication technology. However, the current network possesses several challenges to SFM, due to low bandwidth, high latency, and inability to connect a high amount of IoT (Internet of things) devices. 5G technology promises high-class network services with low latency, high bandwidth, and network slicing to achieve real-time efficiency. Moreover, 5G promises a more sustainable future as it will play a crucial role in reducing energy consumption and shaping future applications to achieve higher sustainability goals. This paper discusses the current challenges and benefits of implementing 5G in various use cases in SFM applications. Furthermore, this paper highlights the Singapore government rollout plan for 5G implementation and discusses the roadmap of SFM use case development initiatives undertaken by 5G Advanced BIM Lab (Department of Building, National University of Singapore) in alignment with the 5G implementation plan of Singapore. Under these 5G SFM projects, the lab seeks to develop state-of-the-art 5G use cases in collaboration with various industry partners and developed a framework for teaching and training to enhance students’ learning motivation and help mid-career professionals to upskill and upgrade themselves to reap multiple benefits using the 5G network. This article will serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for future progress and development of SFM systems by leveraging 5G networks for higher sustainability targets and implementing teaching and learning programs to achieve greater organizational excellence. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging to become a highly potential enabling technology for smart buildings. However, the development of AI applications quite often follows a traditional, closed, and product-oriented approach. This study aims to introduce the platform model and ecosystem thinking to the development of AI-enabled smart buildings. The study identifies the needs for a user-oriented digital service ecosystem and business model in the smart building sector in Finland, which aimed to facilitate the launch of scalable businesses and an experiential and dynamic business ecosystem. A multi-method, interpretive case study was applied in the focal ecosystem, with the leading real estate and facility management operators in Northern Europe as part of a Finnish national innovation project. Our results propose an extended comprehensive framework of the 5C ecosystemic model (Connection, Content, Computation, Context, and Commerce) and the possible paths of ecosystem players in the domain of smart building and smart built environment, both theoretically and empirically. The platform-oriented business models are missing, yet desired, by the ecosystem actors. The value chain and ecosystem platforms imply the quest for new (platform) models. Finally, our research discusses the need for new value-chain-and ecosystem-oriented AI development and big data platforms in the future. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The development and uptake of citizen science and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for ecological monitoring is increasing rapidly. Citizen science and AI allow scientists to create and process larger volumes of data than possible with conventional methods. However, managers of large ecological monitoring projects have little guidance on whether citizen science, AI, or both, best suit their resource capacity and objectives. To highlight the benefits of integrating the two techniques and guide future implementation by managers, we explore the opportunities, challenges, and complementarities of using citizen science and AI for ecological monitoring. We identify project attributes to consider when implementing these techniques and suggest that financial resources, engagement, participant training, technical expertise, and subject charisma and identification are important project considerations. Ultimately, we highlight that integration can supercharge outcomes for ecological monitoring, enhancing cost-efficiency, accuracy, and multi-sector engagement. Citizen science and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used in isolation for ecological monitoring, but their integration likely has emergent benefits for management and scientific inquiry. We explore the complementarity of citizen science and AI for ecological monitoring, highlighting key opportunities and challenges. We show that strategic integration of citizen science and AI can improve outcomes for conservation activities. For example, coupling the public engagement benefits of citizen science with the advanced analytical capabilities of AI can increase multi-stakeholder accord on issues of public and scientific interest. Furthermore, both techniques speed up data collection and processing compared with conventional scientific techniques, suggesting that their integration can fast-track monitoring and conservation actions. We present key project attributes that will assist project managers in prioritizing the resources needed to implement citizen science, AI, or preferably both.

	abstract = {In developing countries, crop field productivity is particularly vulnerable to spreading diseases, including viruses and fungi. This is mostly due to the lack of skilled plant pathologists as well as to the scarce fund and poor infrastructure (e.g., roads, power and water lines) availability. The PlantVillage project through its mobile application named Nuru provides an AI digital assistant to recognize plants and their diseases through image analysis. Through the use of Nuru endowed smartphones, farmers can participate in a mobile crowd-sensing framework to improve their crop production. The crowd sensing framework also contributes to early detection of the outbreak of spreading diseases across geographical regions, and consequent adoption of appropriate countermeasures to ensure food security. As devices are often granted in a limited number by countries' government or charities, we propose a Farmer to Farmer (F2F) cooperation to achieve the required Quality of Information (QoI) for the system. In particular, only a selected crew of farmers receive smartphones to monitor their own farm as well as some other farmers' one. We formulate two variants of the problem of mobile device deployment and task assignment and propose related solutions. We evaluate the proposed approaches through simulations and apply them to a test-bed in Kenya.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The demand for prehospital emergency care has increased during the last decades throughout the Western world, in terms of numbers of emergency calls and dispatched ambulances. This development represents a challenge for both the prehospital emergency systems and the emergency departments at the hospitals [1]. Stroke is the fourth single leading cause of death in the UK and an accurate recognition of stroke by in-ambulance or emergency medical services (EMS) or prehospital ambulance paramedics, offers significant potential to reduce delays in presentation and treatment in acute stroke [2]. This paper demonstrates Proof-of-Concept (PoC) approaches for 5G network slicing in mission-critical use cases from the H2020 5G PPP SliceNet project, which is implementing an End-to-End (E2E) cognitive network slicing and slice management framework in virtualised multi-domain, multi-tenant 5G Networks. The paper shows how the PoC's key enablers, such as QoS-aware network slicing, edge computing and hardware acceleration, can assist with a continuous collection, processing and streaming of patient data that could shorten the time to assess and provide optimal clinical treatment pathways for potential stroke patients. © 2019 IEEE.},

The danger of cyber-attacks in defence microgrid facilities cannot be neglected nor undermined, due to the severe consequences that they can cause. To this end, this paper presents a cyberattack detection and cyber attack severity calculation toolkit, with the aim to provide an end-to-end solution to the cyberattack detection in defense IoT/microgrid systems. Concretely, in this paper are presented and evaluated the SPEAR Visual Analytics AI Engine and the SPEAR Grid Trusted Module (GTM) of the SPEAR H2020 project. The aim of the Visual Analytics AI Engine is to detect malicious action that intend to harm the microgrid and to assist the security engineer of an infrastructure to easily detect abnormalities and submit security events accordingly, while the GTM is responsible to calculate the severity of each security event and to assigns trust values to the affected assets of the system. The accurate detection of cyber-attacks and the efficient reputation management, are assessed with data from a real smart home infrastructure with an installed nanogrid, after applying a 3-stage attack against the MODBUS/TCP protocol used by some of the core nanogrid devices. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Training project managers for navigating their projects in VUCA environments is considered as being extremely challenging. For fulfilling a such objective, the technology-enhanced learning should consider applying diverse and AI-based methods and tools. The paper presents the potential of AI in e-learning for the successfully development of a new mindset as required for managing projects in contexts with high volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. The paper presents the analysis of the efficacy of different AI-based learning and teaching methods for developing the competences associated with the project managers’ mindset, as requested for acting in VUCA environments. The main AI methods and tools which are considered for e-learning are: semantic web, ontologies, machine learning algorithms, AI-based simulations deep-learning. The impact of methods in e-learning is analyzed by considering the relevant competences associated with the mindset growth, as needed for managing projects in VUCA environments. The specific competences which are considered by the authors of the paper are aligned with the OECD Key Competencies, in relation to the creation of new value, the reconciliation of tensions and dilemmas and assuming responsibility. Personal qualities, such as curiosity, resourcefulness, resilience, integrity, engagement, and self-reflection are critical for the mindset growth. The competence model considered by authors is the IPMA ICB (Individual Competence Baseline), version 4.0. Based on this model, the competences are structured into three area: perspective, People and Practice. The authors will consider mainly the competences included in People area. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we report on ethnographic fieldwork studying innovation-as-a-service activities at a large, global technology and services company. These activities focus on the integration of novel artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities in service offerings aimed to provide “innovation” to clients. Our emergent findings center on: relationing (nurturing the various relationships implicated in each engagement) and bundling (crafting compelling, yet mutable documentation for diverse audiences). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

This paper presents the detailed architecture and first prototype of the 5Growth platform taking AI/ML-based network service auto-scaling decisions. This also includes the modification of the ETSI network service descriptors for requesting AI/ML-based decisions for orchestration problems and the integration of a data engineering pipeline for real-time data gathering and model execution. Our evaluation shows that AI/ML-related service handling operations (1-2 s.) are well below instantiation/termination procedures (80/60 s., respectively).

	abstract = {Ever since humans have had people and projects to manage, we’ve had challenges keeping the projects on time, on budget and achieving the desired scope. The field and industry of project management emerged as a way to manage a collection of people towards a goal. For project managers, it has been very common to be managing not only multiple teams, but also multiple projects at the same time. AI has been entering every part of this world and so is into project management. There is software which reduces the backend work of a project manager. The computer itself schedules tasks, meetings and collaborates with various platforms in an organized way. This has led to the reduced demand for a project manager. But again, there is an emerging trend known as emotional intelligence; which states that the project’s success is based on the emotional quotient of the manager with the teammates and other collaborators. Studies have found out that there is a huge difference in the success graph of the projects. Thus, according to this paper, there are these two of many topics which are trending in project management with a very different individual approaches yet complimentary and working towards the same problem of keeping the Iron Triangle balanced.

	abstract = {This WIP presents an innovative collaborative and interdisciplinary approach integrating computer science literacy and digital media literacy to build a critical citizenship-oriented digital education. This approach is inspired by design-oriented research methodology. Designing an activity aimed at digital education has four stages: appropriating of the subject matter, stepping back oneself from the expert knowledge, defining the sequence of the activity, and creating educational materials. It is carried out collaboratively between researchers (activity designers), practitioners (teachers and children), and experts in media and computer science. This approach takes shape through two research projects aimed at 10 to 15-year-old children: a first project targeting artificial intelligence literacy and a second one, Internet security literacy. The AI literacy project is tested with 75 teachers-in-training, five teachers, and 85 children aged 10 to 15. The critical analysis of the approach is at interdisciplinarity and collaboration levels. The alliance of computer science education and digital media education makes it possible to give meaning to educational activities. Turnkey educational materials corresponding to the expectations of teachers, and the reality of a classroom, are created. However, the balance between the two axes is difficult to find. Moreover, this approach takes time and makes project management difficult. © 2020 IEEE.},

The economic scenario displays the impact and how the key players of the ICT scenario fared in this turbulent environment. Contrary to the general negative picture it displays a complex scenario of many positive trends and achievements with emphasis and acceleration of developments and their social acceptance, attaining even extraordinary growth in areas as e.g. the digital health sector and potential future medical applications. While the general public focus is concentrating on the threats of Covid, we will also peruse the evolution of ICT in the shadow of Covid challenge, showing impressive inventiveness in adapting to the new scenario additional and handling the end of Moore and beyond Moore scenario. A fertile symbiosis of evolution and revolutionary technologies is emerging on the horizon or progressing further. Technologies expected in the future as exascale computing, with its bandwidth and storage challenges are not just future, they are already going to be realized now at spearheading projects as Argonne, Lawrence Livermore or CERN. We will survey developments, technologies progressing at accelerated speed in the shadow of Covid, ranging from quantum computing, photonics, molecular electronics, and spintronics. Finally we will look at two-dimensional materials, PCM (phase change materials), as well as AI and neuromorphic computing and collaterally reemerging technologies as UWBG (ultra-wide band gap) with the potential to push the limits of spatial, temporal energy solutions that may be crucial in the coming decennium as well as new materials and devices.

	abstract = {Failures happen. Innumerable sources stress the importance of learning from these mistakes. However, within the construction industry, there is heavy reliance on learning from case-studies of catastrophic events and a lack of attention to the more frequent, lower consequence and yet repetitive failures. These smaller failures can have huge cumulative impact, not to mention their effects on the individual(s) involved. The Health and Safety Executive in their 2018 Annual Report estimated that safety injuries on site cost £490M to the UK economy. Part of this historic inattention is due to difficulties in analysis and sense-making of these failures. While information is collected about the failure event, the data tends to be in the form of free text, which is notoriously difficult to analyse. To begin addressing this, we present an attribute-based method which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to structure text data collected after a safety failure on-site, including near misses and incidents. This structured data allows systematic analysis of these data to improve construction site practices and facilitate data driven decision-making that will reduce safety incidents. Using descriptions from 2345 safety reports, provided by a UK based construction company, we manually refine a set of attribute-based event descriptors from the text descriptions of the incidents and train an NLP model to automatically predict these in new descriptions. As well as presenting a working example of this method, factors affecting the prediction accuracy were also explored. This critique found four aspects which need deliberate consideration in application of NLP to construction safety text. These are (1) the number of attributes; (2) data class imbalance; (3) inclusion of near-miss data as well as incident reports; and (4) algorithm selection and optimisation. This method also anonymises the reports, allowing potential industry-wide data sharing and learning. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.},

This approach employs an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm implemented in a centralized controller. According to the assessment based on the latest specifications of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) the newly defined Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management (UTM) is feasible to implement and utilize an algorithm for dynamic and efficient distribution of available radio resources between all radio nodes involved in process of optimization. An example of proprietary algorithm has been described, which is based on the principles of Kohonen neural networks. The algorithm has been used in simulation scenario to illustrate the performance of the novel approach of centralized radio channels allocation between terrestrial BSs and UxNBs deployed in 3GPP-defined rural macro (RMa) environment. Simulation results indicate that at least 85% of simulated downlink (DL) transmissions are gaining additional channel bandwidth if presented algorithm is used for spectrum distribution between terrestrial BSs and UxNBs instead of baseline soft frequency re-use (SFR) approach. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

In this work we describe our proposal for representing and reasoning about Portuguese documents by means of Linked Data like ontologies and thesauri. Our approach resorts to a specialized pipeline of natural language processing (part-of-speech tagger, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling) to populate an ontology for the domain of criminal investigations. The provided architecture and ontology are language independent. Although some of the NLP modules are language dependent, they can be built using adequate AI methodologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cultural heritage takes an important part of the history of humankind as it is one of the most powerful tools for the transfer and preservation of moral identity. As a result, these cultural assets are considered highly valuable and sometimes priceless. Digital technologies provided multiple tools that address challenges related to the promotion and information access in the cultural context. However, the large data collections of cultural information have more potential to add value and address current challenges in this context with the recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning and data mining tools. Through the present paper, we investigate several approaches that are used or can potentially be used to promote, curate, preserve and value cultural heritage through new and evolutionary techniques based on deep learning tools. The deep learning approaches entirely developed by our team are intended to classify and annotate cultural data, complete missing data, or map existing data schemes and information to standardized schemes with language processing tools. © 2019 IEEE.},

Many organizations use software tools that allow automating the status of projects (situation analysis). These tools also provide predictions on the evolution of projects, using classic techniques such as Earned Value Management (EVM). However, the standard tools do not have many advanced functionalities, based on AI, which would allow to take much better advantage of the knowledge acquired by the organization. This fact is especially important in Risk Management (RM), which is one of the most complex aspects of PM. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology for research and development of tools based on AI technologies that allow organizations to analyze information from projects already developed (historical information) and to use it to improve RM in the planning of future projects. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The remarkable development of the computer graphic techniques enables the creation and management of more realistic games and virtual environments. However, placing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a virtual world get making these environments both more interactive and more believable. One of the most ambitious goals of the AI is to create virtual worlds in which a big number of virtual characters or humans being interacted and behave in an autonomous way. For this purpose, placing embodied intelligence characters in a virtual world offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the AI concept. This paper introduces a Virtual Island developed in an innovative way based on fuzzy rules at the user interaction mechanism. We have used fuzzy tactics to create AI-based animals having various behavior types from an eagles’ perspective which called ‘Flight Simulation’. The simulation utilizes an eagle flying over the airspace of the Island of Chios. The AI on the ground is triggered by other animals when they enter a radius area with a certain speed defined in the software. It then decides how to behave according to health, behavior type and confidence level. Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature. Consequently, the used Fuzzy Tactics have been tested in realized Unity 3D simulation. The results of the study have proven that the virtual environment consisting AI-based animals has a good performance in terms of animal-user interactions and provided satisfactory results in run time. © 2019},

In the health-care domain, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides multiple technologies that allow machines to learn, act and make decisions autonomously. In this sense, AI helps experts and doctors in diseases’ diagnosis and the detection of emerging diseases’ presence. However, the medical data come from multiple sources: doctors, biologists, meteorological specialists, and environmental organizations. The difficulty of the epidemic state’s surveillance lies in the conciliation between the search for the largest number of relevant signals and their treatments. In this paper, we propose the project’s general architecture that facilitates medical data integration and data processing to detect unusual facts and to prevent the presence of emergent diseases. In this proposed data integration architecture, we present the different functionalities, describe its layers and components as well as present an adaptive multi-agent system for the unusual facts’ detection. To this end, the feasibility of our proposal is first proven and later two use cases are presented to cover users’ needs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Lager manufacturers with sufficient resources already invested heavily in smart manufacturing system. There are rapidly emerging needs to help small and medium sized enterprises manufacturers with limited resources to implement smart and highly adaptable manufacturing systems to compete and sustain in global economy. We present an illustrative case study of how to implement and manage AI projects in practice for SME manufacturers. We demonstrated how our proposed architecture can help accelerate one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, i.e. Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, by exhibiting the practicality and scalability of our proposed solution. In particular, we elaborate on the key manufacturing issues concerning company-wide resource distribution, problem solving and decision making. It will be demonstrated that more advanced AI systems such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning emerge naturally with one's quality management system which already in place and come with a well-defined semantics of their process functions in the context of collaborative edge-cloud architecture. Furthermore, equipment used in the smart factory includes manufacturing equipment, functional testing equipment and defect detection equipment. In this work, we will present the management and implementation of on-device AI defect detection and classification to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the edge-cloud collaboration architecture approach.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The digitisation of the construction industry is becoming very important as processes, quality and efficiency are being focused on a lot more. Within the construction industry, knowledge management (KM) is a key part of learning from past mistakes on previous projects. As part of Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the technologies that could provide a potential to the construction industry through gathering knowledge from previous projects to determine future project outcomes. Therefore, this research focusses on AI and its abilities to improve KM for the construction industry in the UK. Qualitative research approach was adopted to collect and analyse the data. A total of 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers within the construction industry. Results show that organisation have already implemented some sort of AI systems within projects and organisations in order to allow for better KM. Combining AI systems into Common Data Environments can help employees in finding documents easier with a unique ID or referenced words. It is concluded that AI systems can be built and used in order to assist with the KM processes that businesses have already implemented. It is recommended that there is a need for developing a business model canvas of implementing AI to benefit from KM within organisations in order to identify the difference between the business processes without AI for KM and with AI being used to assist KM. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

	abstract = {Megaprojects are continuing to capture worldwide attention from India’s Smart Cities, to the $4.75 billion Hadron Collider at CERN, to the US $150 billion International Space Station, and Europe’s largest railway infrastructure project, Crossrail in London. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates global investment needs of $6.3 trillion per year from 2016-2030 (Mirabile, et al. 2017). To meet this growing demand, there has been a recent call, within the megaproject scholarship, for a better understanding of “what goes on in megaprojects – how they are managed and organized, from within, by the managers who are tasked with bringing them to fruition.” (Söderlund, et al. 2017). Studies about megaprojects have generally concentrated on the cost conflicts between the stakeholders and cost overrun issues (Adam et al., 2014; Flyvbjerg, 2017), however these have been superseded by more important issues in recent years such as project security, protecting the health and safety of its workers, project sustainability and value creation, and managing the impact of climate change and presently a global pandemic. All of these require a more agile approach to project management and a more sophisticated intelligence that can be generated through Algorithms that are used to generate artificially intelligent systems. Through an analysis of the AI and Project Management literature, ethnographic studies, and semi-structured interviews with project management professionals, this paper explores the growing use of Artificial Intelligence to manage megaprojects including the obligations of private industry, and the government as the guardian of the public interest, while at the same time exploring the technical, managerial and ethical considerations in the deployment of AI. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

Here, the demonstration is based on a freely accessible material: the data from the great national debate launched in early 2019 by the French President Macron in response to the large-scale social movement known as the “yellow vests”. Design/methodology/approach: Step 1 consisted of understanding the methods and conclusions of the providers responsible for processing the data of the great debate (1.5 million contributors). Step 2 was to analyze the formal elements of a random set of online contributions. Then, to compare the results. Findings: This research shows that the processing of the data is based almost exclusively on texts, to the detriment of data on the source, date and arrangement of contributions, which could nevertheless be exploited as metadata. Research limitations/implications: The mass of data and the lack of online accessibility of part of the corpus did not make it possible to complete the experiment. Practical implications: This research lays the foundation for other projects for collaboration between archival science and artificial intelligence tools. Social implications: There is a social challenge involving researchers in information sciences in public debate and governmental consultations. There is also an issue for a records manager to become more involved in the production of public records by promoting their specific skills in information management. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is to show how archival science can help to improve the quality of the documentary corpuses used by artificial intelligence tools, and therefore, to improve the performance of these tools. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Its areas of implementation encompasses diverse fields from defense to civil departments, from meteorology to disaster management, from traffic analysis to network planning etc. Centre for Development of Telematics (CDOT) has developed a software system for analyzing and identifying optimized GIS routes for laying optical fiber who's planning has been done by Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL). BBNL has done planning for connecting Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) to the Central Office (CO). These routes have been planned by doing manual foot survey. This software system analyses whether the planned GIS routes are optimal or not and suggests optimized fiber routes for planning. In this paper we have presented a solution to the problem that we faced during above mentioned project execution. We have suggested an algorithmic solution based on C4.5 Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm. This software system first learns based on user input and then creates rules. Using these rules software system provides fiber planning of optical network over GIS. This algorithm, using machine learning, finds best possible route from a set of routes calculated using different GIS data sources. © 2018 IEEE.},

Collected case studies support a Tai Chi-based framework for global project teams to reduce stress and improve decision making through exercises, storytelling, and martial arts practices. The authors first proposed a model or procedural framework based on experiential knowledge from practicing Tai Chi while managing projects. Design/methodology/approach – Analyzing case studies from knowledge managers, project managers, and executive leaders, the researchers collected data on applying the framework from a retrospective case study and from two observational case studies during project development. Tai Chi-based communications and exercises were shown to support critical thinking, knowledge sharing, and problem solving. The proposed framework and four-step procedure build on a global perspective to cultural awareness, creativity, and motivation as well as specific Tai Chi-based tactics, techniques, and operations for knowledge management. This preliminary study looks at improving collaboration in a competitive environment while supporting health, wellness, and work-life enjoyment. Findings – Early research results suggest that teams and individuals working on projects and practicing Tai Chi might develop more cohesive strategies and improve soft skills during their integration of Eastern and Western philosophies. Research limitations/implications – Used case studies methodology, which provided examples of using Tai Chi during projects. Qualitative data used to develop the proposed framework. Also, interviews and discussion reviews conducted for additional validation collected on framework. Practical implications – It is a pioneering, preliminary study. Future research with outcomes-based data from project managers using Tai Chi recommended. Originality/value – The integration of Eastern and Western philosophies into a framework for team project and knowledge management was shown to support cohesive strategies, improve soft skills, and strengthen decision making. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It is possible to see the growing tendency to use chatbots in the customer service field on a worldwide scale. AI chatbots that are designed for employees support is a prospective niche that will grow rapidly over the next decade and one of the areas that could benefit from AI chatbots is project management. Main work categories where chatbots could be useful is the automation of routine project management tasks, data processing and analysis. The paper aims to demonstrate the potential of using chatbots in project management and to prove the authors’ hypothesis-AI chatbots use in project management can save time for project managers (and project team) and reduce factors of project failure. The hypothesis has been tested with AI chatbot prototypes. The paper contains results of the chatbots existing and potential possibilities for project management support, proof of concept (PoC) for implementing chatbot and a brief insight into developed chatbot prototypes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Research shows that Analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) projects have high failure rates of up to 80 percent of projects, and suffer from low uptake of big data and AI tooling. Our internal research indicates two core problems that customers face when generating business outcomes from analytics. Firstly, business customers are often totally overwhelmed in knowing where to start. They report that even the simplest modern BI tools provide little or no help in analyzing their data and do not reflect the needs of their business. Secondly, when they do generate insights from their data they often have no trust in these, as they cannot understand provenance information about where the data came from, what was done to it by systems and individuals in their organization. We present a new approach to solving these analytics challenges using a new semantic ‘data fabric’ platform for business computing, based on the Amazon Neptune graph database service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other AWS cloud technologies. This architecture is purpose built around a semantic schema and custom tools that model and manage business data in a form understandable by business users. As a schema-centric platform, all insight is grounded from the definitions and relationships in actual business data, and provenance data captured throughout the platform and across all data flows.

As a didactic support and aiming to facilitate the understanding of the analysis, the period of the 18 years studied was divided into 3 time periods (First decade, Reduction Period and Period of Growth). The study also raised the distribution of AI application in HR topics and the incidence in each of these themes. As a result, it was concluded that there are few researches on AI applied to Human Resources and a dispersed use behaviour.

The research aims to accelerate and improve the quality of adaptive CH re-use. The complexity of the problem derives from some causes of different nature: lack of attention to this problem from the public administration and private investors; decision-making processes complicated by the need to connect with experts, located in different countries. Most professionals, related to the CH management, cannot access detailed data about already existing successful initiatives. The specific objective and goal of the research is the creation of an AI framework and eco-system for supporting the development and implementation of innovative business and governance models to fill up the investment gap in the adaptive re-use practices. The paper shortly describes the first steps for creating a platform designed and developed to assist and advice public entities, networked experts, private entrepreneurs and citizens in actions aiming at the valorisation of the historic and CH asset and its integration in different groups of countries to boost growth, job opportunities and social benefits, under overall sustainability constraints. The technical solutions here adopted are based on convergent methodology and networked expertise (e-expertise) technology, open data models and active knowledge extraction and processing, machine learning, collective intelligence, recommendation systems and predictive analytics, CH adaptive re-use, innovation business, and models and case-based reasoning methods. Examples of case studies giving the inception for the project components are given. © 2018 The author(s).},

	abstract = {A Systems Engineer’s Virtual Assistant (SEVA) is a novel attempt to bridge the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Base (KB) Construction research, and NASA’s Systems Engineering domain. In this work, we propose the design of an explainable, human-in-the-loop, and interactive personal assistant system. The assistant will help a Systems Engineer in their daily work environment through complex information management and high-level question-answering to augment their problem-solving abilities. We describe the fundamental characteristics of the assistant by understanding operational, functional, and system requirements from Systems Engineers and NASA’s Systems Engineering Handbook. The assistant is designed to act as a workbench to manage dynamic information about projects and analyze hypothetical scenarios. It is also designed to make logical inferences and perform temporal reasoning by handling domain information and information related to schedule and resources. In addition, the system learns new information over time by interacting with its user and can perform case-based reasoning from previous experiences. The knowledge base design describes a novel hybrid approach to build a domain-independent common-sense framework with which domain-specific engineers can attune it and build their projects. Using these specific objectives and constraints, the architecture of a personal assistant is proposed. Main contributions of this design paper are Systems Engineering (SE) domain analysis, a survey of existing research, preliminary experiments using the state-of-the-art systems to explore the feasibility, a proposal of a complete architecture with component level detail, and identification of areas that require further research and development.

The performance of the AI methods is assessed by means of a large and topologically diverse dataset and is benchmarked against the best performing Earned Value Management/Earned Schedule (EVM/ES) methods. The results show that the AI methods outperform the EVM/ES methods if the training and test sets are at least similar to one another. Additionally, the AI methods report excellent early and mid-stage forecasting results. A robustness experiment gradually increases the discrepancy between the training and test sets and demonstrates the limitations of the newly proposed AI methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) method then makes use of the reduced training set to predict the real duration of a project. Additionally, we report on the forecasting stability of the various AI methods and their hybrid Nearest Neighbour counterparts. A large computer experiment is set up to assess the forecasting accuracy and stability of the existing and newly proposed methods. The experiments indicate that the Nearest Neighbour technique yields the best stability results and is able to improve the AI methods when the training set is similar or not equal to the test set. Sensitivity checks vary the amount of historical data and number of neighbours, leading to the conclusion that having more historical data, from which the a relevant subset can be selected by means of the proposed Nearest Neighbour technique, is preferential. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious-contagious disease that affects mainly the lungs, ranking in the 10 main causes of death in the world. Non-adherence or non-treatment of TB may prolong transmissibility, increase the risk of drug resistance and lead to patient death. One step forward is the use of smartphones for monitoring the medication intake via video (VDOT). VDOT is a more acceptable and cost-effective option than the traditional DOT (in person). However, the VDOT system requires a professional (verifying agent) to check all medication intake daily. Based on an initiative that aims to replace the verifying agent with an artificial intelligence tool capable of validating it automatically through computer vision techniques (AI-based VDOT), the main goal of this work is to measure the acceptance and perception of Brazilian health professionals on the AI-Based VDOT before implementing this technology by using a quantitative questionnaire as instrument.

In our view, the following points are essential: 1.Introducing AI has to be part of a holistic strategy of transforming service management. It requires both top-down leadership support as well as community engagement, and clear communication of expected results as well as limitations. It is not just about selection of technologies and training of practitioners but has deep implications for processes and organizational culture.2.AI has great potential to significantly change and elevate the work that performed by human experts by identifying automation opportunities. This requires different skills and organizational setups and should be use to accelerate agile transformation. We suggest to run the introduction of AI as an agile project, with disciplined iterations and clear measurements [1]3.A successful AI strategy for IT requires establishing a data-driven approach and culture. Understanding IT operational data (especially ticket data for incidents and service requests) is a prerequisite to knowing what questions to ask and how to accelerate the training of AI.4.When building ground truths, leverage your organizational knowledge and treat it as an enterprise asset, but also be prepared to challenge hidden assumptions. Establish an end-to-end knowledge lifecycle strategy that engages the subject matter experts. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Machine learning (ML) can predict future developments and support decision-making by extracting insights from large amounts of generated data. This functionality greatly impacts and streamlines the strategic decision-making process of organizations. The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management.

	abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) receive an important interest from Artificial Intelligence researches (AI) this last decade due to their high capability to learn complex internal structures to expose relevant information. However, RNNs fail to reveal long-term dependencies and new RNN with gates have been proposed to address this drawback such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This RNN-based model requires 4 gates to learn both short and long-term dependencies for a given sequence of basic elements. Recently, a new family of RNN called “Gated Recurrent Unit” has been introduced. The GRU contains few gates (reset and update gates) but is based on gates grouping without taking into account the latent relations between short and long-term dependencies. The GRU term dependencies management through hidden units is therefore similar for all hidden neurons. Moreover, the learning of gated RNNs requires a large amount of data and, despite the advent of GPU cards that allow the model to be learned quicker, the processing time is quite costly. This paper proposes a new RNN called “Parsimonious Memory Unit” (PMU) based on the strong assumption that short and long-term dependencies are related and that the role of each hidden neuron has to be different to better handle term dependencies. Experiments conduced on both a small (short-term) spoken dialogues data set from the DECODA project, a large (long-term) textual document corpus from the 20-Newsgroups and a language modeling task, show that the proposed PMU-RNN reaches similar, even better performances (efficiency) with less processing time (improve portability) with a gain of 50%. Moreover, the experiments on the gates’ activity show that the proposed PMU manages better term dependencies than the GRU-RNN model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Boolean satisfiability is a fundamental problem in computer science with a wide range of applications including planning, configuration management, design and verification of software/hardware systems. The annual SAT competition continues to witness impressive improvements in the performance of the winning SAT solvers largely thanks to the development of new heuristics arising out of intensive collaborative research in the SAT community. Modern SAT solvers achieve scalability and robustness with sophisticated heuristics that are challenging to understand and explain. Consequently, the development of new algorithmic insights has been primarily restricted to expert intuitions and evaluation of the new insights have been restricted to performance measurement in terms of the runtime of solvers or a proxy for the runtime of solvers. In this context, one may ask: whether it is possible to develop a framework to provide white-box access to the execution of SAT solver that can aid both SAT solver developers and users to synthesize algorithmic heuristics for modern SAT solvers? The primary focus of our project is precisely such a framework, which we call CrystalBall. More precisely, we propose to view modern conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers as a composition of classifiers and regressors for different tasks such as branching, clause memory management, and restarting. The primary objective of this paper is to introduce a framework to peek inside the SAT solvers – CrystalBall – to the AI and SAT community. The current version of CrystalBall focuses on deriving a classifier to keep or throw away a learned clause. In a departure from recent machine learning based techniques, CrystalBall employs supervised learning and uses extensive, multi-gigabyte data extracted from runs of a single SAT solver to perform predictive analytics. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {5G networks will grant spectacular improvements of the most relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) while allowing resource multi-tenancy through network slicing. However, the other side of the coin is represented by the huge increase of the management complexity and the need for efficient algorithms for resource orchestration. Therefore, the management and orchestration of the network through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is considered a promising solution, as it allows to reduce the human interaction (usually expensive and error-prone) and scale to large scenario composed by thousands of slices in heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we provide a review of the current standardization efforts in this field, mostly due to the work performed by the Experiential Network Intelligence (ENI) industry specification group (ISG) within the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Then, we thoroughly describe an exemplary use case on elastic network management and orchestration through learning solutions proposed by the 5GPPP project 5G-MoNArch and recently approved at ETSI ENI. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It has been claimed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) carries enormous potential for service and product innovation. Policy makers world-wide nowadays aim to foster environments conducive for AI-based innovation. This paper addresses the current lack of empirical data for evidence-based innovation policies and the management of AI-based innovation. It focuses on "AI and innovation management" in addressing the question whether innovation that is based on new AI technology requires a management approach different from other forms of IT innovation. We present results from a study of Austrian companies on the degree of use and implementation of AI, and on challenges related to AI-based innovation management. This study used a keyword-list approach to define "Artificial Intelligence" and to find Al-based innovation projects in research databases. These projects facilitated the identification of experts from organisations developing AI-based innovation. In total, eleven experts were interviewed about their AI-based innovation activities. The results show that AI is a very fast emerging technology that is being applied in many sectors. A broad range of innovative solutions are being developed and some have already reached the market. Specific AI business models are, however, less clear and still developing. Companies are facing multiple challenges from regulation to human resources and data collection. Managing AI-based innovation will be particularly difficult for smaller enterprises, where problems are often more pronounced than in larger industries. Explicit challenges for managing AI-based innovations include the necessary attention to managing expectations and ensuring historic metadata expertise essential for many AI-based solutions. Policies to support AI-based innovation therefore should focus on human aspects. This includes increasing the availability of AI experts, but also concerns the development of new job profiles, such as experts in AI training. AI innovators also require clear AI regulation and research investments in key challenges, such as explainable AI. © 2019 Carleton University. All Rights Reserved.},

In the coming years, the relationship between people and digitized systems is going to change due in large part to the adoption of ambient technologies in daily life and to the considerable development in AI (Artificial Intelligence). This includes emerging 5G technologies, small medical devices, non-invasive new sensing technologies, collaborative robots (e.g. Amazon Echo, Google home, etc.), Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and secured data exchange mechanisms (e.g. Blockchain). Over the next 20 years there will be demographic shift from predominantly younger populations to older ones. Current models of care and pathways need to be transformed to become more citizen focused as well as to support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will require different approaches to innovation in information technologies to improve quality of life for people as they age, to reduce onset of frailty as well as to better support those with long term conditions employing self-management and prevention strategies. This paper describes on-going project between NUS, IMT, HDB (Housing Development Board), and AXA Insurance, and aiming at preserving patient health and avoid deterioration of their quality of life (and also of their families) by fully utilizing disruptive information & communication technologies.

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of transportation has enabled us to travel to any part of the world. At the same time, infectious diseases are now able to reach anywhere in the world via this same ease of travel. In 2015, a MERS epidemic broke out in Korea. The MERS virus infected 186 people with 38 dead and caused economic damage worth 6 billion dollars. In this paper, we investigate a joint project of KT and KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to prevent infectious diseases through the use of mobile roaming Big Data. KT developed a monitoring system that uses telephone roaming data to identify subscribers who traveled to a country affected with an infectious disease. Upon returning to Korea, a subscriber receives a notice that he/she is required to report for potential quarantine in accordance with the regulations and gets guided on the measures to take in case symptoms of the infectious disease occur. The travel information is also provided to healthcare facilities throughout the country for reference when symptomatic individuals visit them. Laws and regulations are enacted to allow personal information to be used to prevent and control infectious diseases. By providing a solution for monitoring individuals with potential risk of having been infected, loss of life and financial loss caused by the spread of panic of infectious disease have been minimized. This study is an example of the significant social contribution of Big Data. The global propagation of this system can reduce the threat of the spread of infection significantly. © 2018 Authors.},

	abstract = {In times of Big Data and Industry 4.0, organizational information as well as knowledge availability and quantity are driving complex decision-making tasks. Especially for AI systems, increasing knowledge-bases for elaborate computations lead to a lower efficiency of their inference mechanisms. In contrast to AI, bounded cognitive capacity is a well-known problem in psychology. When humans receive too much information, a state of information overload emerges. In order to cope with limited capacity and prevent information overload, humans adapt their knowledge and delete, override, suppress, or sort out outdated information, i.e., they forget. By transferring theories from human cognition to multiagent systems, the AdaptPRO project adopts intentional forgetting as a strategy for coping with information overload in both human and multiagent teams. This article gives an overview of an interdisciplinary research project with a strong focus on knowledge distributions and knowledge dynamics from a distributed AI perspective. Its core contribution is a formal model for distributing and adapting (meta-) knowledge by intentional forgetting to enable efficient and resilient teamwork. © 2018, Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Today's project planning tools require the generation and sequencing of each activity. Establishing interactive computer based scheduled plan for a project requires not only injecting the information technology, but all project activities and inserting their durations and resource requirements in organized and sequenced manner. New parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) software like Revit can dramatically enhance planning productivity by substantially reducing the work necessary for preparing construction schedule. The new parametric BIM can automate exchange of information during design, construction and service life of projects. In this paper, the Revit is connected to Primavera software by conducting expert system that supports automatic generation of the project plan scheduling scheme of project control functions. This will eliminate some of the most tedious and time consuming steps in creating a construction project schedule. © 2019 IEEE.},

Project management has a large socio-technical element with many uncertainties arising from variability in human aspects, e.g. customers' needs, developers' performance and team dynamics. AI can assist project managers and team members by automating repetitive, high-volume tasks to enable project analytics for estimation and risk prediction, providing actionable recommendations, and even making decisions. AI is potentially a game changer for project management in helping to accelerate productivity and increase project success rates. In this paper, we propose a framework where AI technologies can be leveraged to offer support for managing agile projects, which have become increasingly popular in the industry. © 2019 IEEE.},

The theoretical arguments of "Fuzzy-AI model" are presented for dealing with the quantization of uncertain management events, which simulates the intelligence of human being by AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology and quantizes the management solution by fuzzy approach. Several practical examples are presented in this paper as the evidence of the applicability of this model in the project management issues, which provides digital support to decision maker in the management. Finally, the theoretical framework of applying this model in different stages of project management is presented for the purpose of calibrating its application scope. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Games have been an important tool for motivating undergraduate students majoring in computer science and engineering. However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games, first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their controllers. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology area creating high expectations in many enterprises when it comes to potential benefits for improving business, automating tasks or facilitating new kinds of services. However, the organizational take-up of 'hyped technologies', such as AI, is accompanied by the danger that expectations regarding the benefits of the technology are not realistic which can result in failed innovation projects. This paper investigates expectations of two groups of enterprises from different application domains towards the organizational AI use. The results of the study indicate that often the technology is put into the focus rather than the organizational context which leads to neglecting requirements regarding process integration or data availability. As a consequence, the paper proposes a method component adding to enterprise architecture management, which describes how the organizational context of AI can be determined as support for AI requirements analysis and feasibility studies. The method component is demonstrated in a project aiming at introducing AI into instant payment transactions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The suggestion of route with shortest travel time avoids unnecessary traveling by cars. Achieving this goal not only reduces air pollution, but also it saves time and money. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to predict routes travel time. Vehicular networks are considered as an efficient approach to traffic management applications. Since it takes time to cover all the streets and equip all vehicles with the network connection equipment, in the present study, a method has presented and simulated in which vehicles in the parts of the roads that are not covered by vehicular networks, be able to predict travel time of their routes according to past traffic information. So two paradigms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been used for this purpose. This study overcomes two important constraints in the previous studies. First, in most of the previous studies, in order to predict travel time using vehicular networks, the installation RSUs was necessary for all intersections. In the proposed method, this restriction is removed. Secondly, the instantaneous and accurate data obtained from the vehicular networks were used for data training of the artificial neural network. In previous works, training data was collected with old equipment such as detectors, traffic monitoring cameras, sensors, etc. This equipment can inform about the status of traffic parameters in the installed area and do not cover the roads network entirely. Finally, the accuracy of prediction of travel time with two models of AI is evaluated and a model with less prediction error is used for simulation. The results show that the proposed method can predict travel time of routes with the desired precision and it can conduct cars to the route with the shortest travel time. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proliferated in stability prediction of construction projects in the past decade. However, the application of AI approaches did not reach the peak of its potential due to the inappropriate handling of missing data and the omission of state-of-the-art techniques. In the present contribution, we proposed a hybrid method for the improved stability prediction of construction projects based on individual machine learning (ML) algorithms, input missing data imputation, semi-supervised learning and the classifier ensemble. Seven ML algorithms were selected to build individual classifiers for the classifier ensemble. 5-fold cross validation was used as the validation method and the performance measures were chosen to be the confusion matrix, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under ROC curve (AUC). Exhaustive grid search and firefly algorithm were used for hyper-parameters and weights tuning respectively. The capability of the proposed method was verified using an underground construction dataset, the stope hangingwall (HW) dataset. The case study shows that the input missing data imputation and semi-supervised learning improved the predictive performance of ML algorithms on HW stability prediction. The highest and average AUC values on the testing set were increased to 0.954 and 0.923 respectively on the expanded dataset, compared with 0.879 and 0.860 on the original complete dataset. Further improvement was obtained through the classifier ensemble, with the AUC value being increased to 0.976. Harnessing such method extends recent efforts for stability prediction in construction projects, and can significantly accelerate the project design and stability management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Plant diseases are a major threat to farmers, consumers, environment and the global economy. In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved. Our solution is a novel, scalable and accessible tool for disease management of diverse agricultural crop plants and can be deployed as a Cloud based service for farmers and experts for ecologically sustainable crop production. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many companies are running digitalization initiatives or are planning to do so. There exist various models to evaluate the digitalization potential of a company and to define the maturity level of a company in exploiting digitalization technologies summarized under buzzwords such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). While platforms, protocols, patterns, technical implementations, and standards are in place to adopt these technologies, small- to medium-sized enterprises (SME) still struggle with digitalization. This is because it is hard to identify the most beneficial projects with manageable cost, limited resources and restricted know-how. In the present paper, we describe a real-life project where digitalization use cases have been identified, evaluated, and prioritized with respect to benefits and costs. This effort led to a portfolio of projects, some with quick and easy wins and some others with mid- to long-term benefits. From our experiences, we extracted a general approach that could be useful for other SMEs to identify concrete digitalization activities and to define projects implementing their digital transformation. The results are summarized in a Digitalization Canvas. © J.UCS.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates what forms the knowledge work design in the future on a corporate level and a societal level. The future might be 2025, 2030, or 2035. The methodology is including in depth interviews with researchers working with these issues in the Swedish telecommunication company Telia and the Norwegian telecommunication company Telenor. These are both companies making their living of understanding the future of work both on a corporate level and a societal level. The main finding is that AI and robotics will be more advanced, but the management and organizational structure will be the same as today. The steps will be taken one by one toward a technology making new opportunities for collaboration and knowledge work. The real knowledge worker will be using more of his working time to significant business issues. The ideal business model is a framework where a professional knowledge worker is both learning and using his qualifications. The development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes will be the key to delivering excellent results. The future of knowledge work is giving people the opportunities to deliver excellent results and rewarded for these results as a part of their team more than as individuals. To make ordinary people produce extraordinary results in that project teams will be the future of knowledge work. There will be clusters of corporations globally, nationally, and local demanding individual and corporate collaboration. More people than ever will be better educated with a more common mindset making collaboration and teamwork easier. There will be more knowledge workers than anytime in 2030. According to Telia and Telenor, corporations and individuals will take environmental issues much more seriously, and large corporation together with the dominating economic over national powers will make the necessary starting steps to save the world. The saving of the earth represents a concentration of both corporate and national power. Neither The number of jobs will be increasing owing to both economic growth and more opportunities together with increasing health service and an educated workforce. There will be higher profits and higher sales per employee. This study concludes that there will be many small positive corporate and societal steps for each year towards 2030, improving the way of living and working together with environmental improvements. The reconstruction of the middle class is also emerging - neither a perfect nor imperfect world. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Customer service is a differentiating capability for companies, but it faces significant challenges due to the growing individualization and connectivity of products, the increasing complexity of knowledge that service employees need to deal with, and steady cost pressure. Artificial intelligence (AI) can support service processes in a variety of ways, however, many projects simply propose replacing employees with chat bots. In contrast to pure automation focusing on customer self-service, we introduce three intelligent assistants that support service employees in their complex tasks: the scribe, the skill manager, and the background knowledge worker. In this paper, we discuss the technology and architecture underlying the skill manager in more detail. We present the results from an evaluation of commercial cognitive services from IBM and Microsoft on comprehensive real-world data that comprises over 80,000 tickets from a major IT service provider, where problem reports often comprise an email-based conversation in multiple languages. We demonstrate how today’s commercially available cognitive services struggle to correctly analyze this data unless they use background ontological knowledge. We further discuss a pattern- and machine-learning based approach that we developed to extract problem descriptions from multi-lingual ticket texts, which is key to the successful application of AI-based services. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

In such scenarios, most of the resources spent in a PM project (in terms of time and expertise) are usually devoted to try different ways of selecting and preparing the input data for PM tasks, in order to eventually obtain significant, interpretable and actionable results. Two general AI-based strategies are discussed here that have been partly pursued in the literature to improve the achievements of PM efforts on low-quality logs, and to limit the amount of human intervention needed: (i) using explicit domain knowledge, and (ii) exploiting auxiliary AI tasks.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the creation of a smart machine that has human behaviour and response. AI in the education sector is able to interact, assist, and guide students through Self-Exploration Education (SEE) in Self Determined Learning (SDL) or Heutagogical technique, such as current, but semi-automatic learning systems. Malaysian higher education institutions are forced to adapt to such a radical change in order to stay competitive and fulfill their stakeholder needs. Everyone is born as a genius, with curiosity to explore the environment through experiments. This study examines the effect of SDL on SEE in Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System until 2030. It does that under two different lenses: First, the effect on the value proposition and the business models of the SDL. Second, it identifies hurdles for the implementation and draws strategic implications for the SDL Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System. However, in practice, SEE is still very much focused on spreading facts rather than encouraging personal exploration. Conducting exploration of learning in the classroom can be complicated for adult learning or andragogy and is limited by virtue, money and work infrastructure. But what if we can create a middle ground between learning and fiction, the world in which adults learn and explore in ways that may be impossible in real life but still true to the transfer of knowledge? The project is to craft an imaginative and accessible tool to help adults develop scientific minds and practices through self-exploration or Do-it-yourself DIY with a mixed reality learning system that empowers adults to know the invisible and investigate hard through exploration. By 2030 the likeliest scenario is that fully Self-Exploration is solely available for particularly high-value use cases, affecting the value proposition toward provision of education services, an increase of stakeholder and value-centric value propositions fostered by continuous interactions between the Heutagogical technique and the stakeholder. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {A construction project is a temporary production system which is designed and delivered within a specified time and budget. The traditional system has approximately 50% of non-value-added efforts and waste. As the traditional ways cannot handle complex and uncertain activities, there is a need for innovative and advanced systems that will help the project teams’ deal with the issues in projects. Lean techniques, Enterprise Resource Planning and Artificial Intelligence are such innovative techniques which have a good impact in the construction industry. As each system has the impact only in the implemented stage of construction, there is scope for loss of resources in the other construction phases. This paper proposes a contagious loop system comprising of Lean techniques, Enterprise Resource Planning and Artificial Intelligence as the robust approach for construction project management to improve the productivity, reduce the cost, time, resources and discuss the importance of implementing the contagious loop system. This paper uses exploratory method for evaluating the individual gains of Lean techniques, Enterprise Resource Planning and Artificial Intelligence by exploring and understanding the available literature, case studies and tries to propose an advanced implementation system to the construction industry for achieving minimization of resources, improving the productivity within the built environment. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {While living longer at home is the preferred option for the elderly, disease, accidents or general health decline might make this hard. Fall accidents, which are among the chief causes of unforced injury leading to hospitalization, must be viewed as a strong factor working against the possibilities for the elderly of living longer at home. Although many fall prevention programs have been developed and applied, and checklists and advice abound, most of these originate in the professional care area or depend on care professionals. In this paper, we present a fall prevention concept directed towards elderly people living at home, with the intention of providing a safer environment ensuring more years of doing this in a healthy manner. There are several obstacles for a successful implementation of fall prevention, many pending on the attitudes and thought systems of the elderly user community, including low risk awareness, technological stigmata, refusal to be associated with health problems and a general "not for me" world view. The paper presents an AI/IoT-driven learning environment for fall prevention which facilitates living independently and improved self-understanding to provide for easier everyday living. The central design idea is to lead the user through a learning process including acquiring knowledge of fall prevention, personal characteristics, taking fall prevention action and understanding the outcomes of changed behaviors. The concluding outcome is a discussion of a set of design variables for the effective implementation of fall prevention systems, including a holistic view of fall prevention and aging, open platform technologies, a flexible and adaptable module approach, feedback-based learning, IoT/sensor-driven learning, personalization and goal orientation and the dual use of technology avoiding technology stigmas. © 2019 The Authors.

To make this idea a valuable novelty worth investing in requires identification, assessment and management of innovation projects under two primary aspects: The Market Readiness Level (MRL) measures if there is actually a market willing to buy the envisioned product. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) measures the capability to produce the product. The READINESSnavigator is a state of the art software tool that supports innovators and investors in managing these aspects of innovation projects. The existing technology readiness levels neatly model the production of physical goods but fall short in assessing data based products such as those based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). In this paper we describe our extension of the READINESSnavigator with AI and ML relevant readiness levels and evaluate its usefulness in the context of 25 different AI projects.

This approach is part of a global project of implementing a strategic intelligence device based on four pillars, namely: strategic watch, Knowledge Management, influence and lobbying techniques and protection and information security. The materialization of this project has gone through the realization of a study aiming three main objectives: (1) studying the monitoring practices within the OCP Group; (2) identifying and studying the needs of decision makers concerning strategic information; (3) propose a capitalization approach for information's resulting from the strategic watch activities of the group in order to better position it in an increasingly competitive market. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey with the managers of the monitoring activities within the Group to better understand this activity and identify their needs and target our proposal. This project is the first national experiment in Morocco to develop ontology in the field of phosphates that can inspire other works in other sectors of activity. In this article, we will first present the context of the research. Then, we will dedicate a part of it for defining the main concepts mobilized in our research namely, strategic intelligence and ontologies. Finally, the process of designing and implementing the ontology. Although related since its appearance in the field of philosoph (Univesalis encyclopedia), the notion of ontology is considered in this article from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) angle. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly integrated with society (e.g., in the form of digital assistants, games, or self-driving cars), it becomes increasingly important to understand how they can ensure that people's experiences meet certain desirable criteria. In Experience Management, researchers and professionals seek to create automated systems called "experience managers", which work to improve people's experiences in designer-specified ways. Unfortunately, the evaluation and comparison of experience managers is currently impaired by the lack of both a common platform to evaluate them and a common language to describe experience management tasks. Experience in other fields such as General Game Playing and AI Planning has shown that having a common platform can stimulate and accelerate research progress. The goal of this project is thus to develop a platform for evaluating and comparing arbitrary experience managers on a wide variety of tasks, to accelerate the essential progress of Experience Management research. We plan to do this by studying existing experience managers, developing a common platform that can support them, and promoting the platform to the research community as a tool for their research. Throughout our work, we will draw lessons from the field of General Game Playing, hoping to reuse some of its existing infrastructure and stimulate new exchanges of ideas between the two fields of research.

	abstract = {SUMMARY: The management and the identification of design changes constitute an essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, requiring the formalisation of a multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment. Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details. In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between IFC files throughout the design processes. A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers. Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models. COPYRIGHT: © 2019 The author(s).

Most of the recent research works on QoS in IoT have used Machine Learning (ML) techniques as one of the computing methods for improved performance and solutions. The adoption of Machine Learning and its methodologies have become a common trend and need in every technologies and domain areas, such as open source frameworks, task specific algorithms and using AI and ML techniques. In this work we propose an ML based prediction model for resource optimization in the IoT environment for QoS provisioning. The proposed methodology is implemented by using a multi-layer neural network (MNN) for Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) learning in layered IoT environment. Here the model considers the resources like bandwidth and energy as QoS parameters and provides the required QoS by efficient utilization of the resources in the IoT environment. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in a real field implementation by considering a civil construction project, where in the real data is collected by using video sensors and mobile devices as edge nodes. Performance of the prediction model is observed that there is an improved bandwidth and energy utilization in turn providing the required QoS in the IoT environment. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Construction projects are complex projects taking place in dynamic environments, which necessitates accounting for different uncertainties during the planning stage. There is a significant lack of management tools for repetitive projects accounting for uncertainties in the construction environment. The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for the optimized scheduling of repetitive construction projects under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy set theory is utilized to model uncertainties associated with various input parameters. The developed algorithm has two main components: optimization component and buffering component. The optimization component presents a dynamic programming approach that processes fuzzy numbers. The buffering component converts the optimized fuzzy schedule into a deterministic schedule and inserts time buffers to protect the schedule against anticipated delays. Agreement Index (AI) is used to capture the user's desired level of confidence in the produced schedule while sizing buffers. The algorithm is capable of optimizing for cost or time objectives. An example project drawn from literature is analysed to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed algorithm and to allow comparison of results to those previously generated. Findings: Testing the algorithm revealed several findings. Fuzzy numbers can be utilized to capture uncertainty in various inputs without the need for historical data. The modified algorithm is capable of optimizing schedules, for different objectives, under uncertainty. Finally AI can be used to capture users' desired confidence in the final schedule.

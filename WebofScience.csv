In a survey, a group of project management experts were asked to state their insights into AI's likely effect on project management in the next 10 years. Results clearly illustrated that AI will be an integrated part of future project management practice and will affect project management knowledge areas in the near future. According to these findings, the management of cost, schedule, and risk, in particular, will be highly affected by AI. The research indicates that AI is very useful for processes where historical data is available and can be used for estimation and planning. In addition, it is clear that AI can monitor schedules, adjust forecasts, and maintain baselines. According to the findings, AI will have less impact in knowledge areas and processes that require human leadership skills, such as developing and managing teams and the management of stakeholders. The results indicate proprietarily the project management knowledge areas as defined by PMI that AI is likely to augment and sustain.","[Fridgeirsson, Thordur Vikingur; Ingason, Helgi Thor; Jonasson, Haukur Ingi; Jonsdottir, Hildur] Reykjavik Univ, Dept Engn, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Reykjavik University,"Fridgeirsson, TV (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Dept Engn, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",thordurv@ru.is; helgithor@ru.is; haukuringi@ru.is; hildurj6@ru.is,"Jonasson, Haukur Ingi/AAF-3469-2019; Ingason, Helgi/S-2567-2018","Ingason, Helgi/0000-0003-0606-0867",,,,,37,29,32,40,196,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,2345,10.3390/su13042345,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042345,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ8IQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000624763700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To gain a deeper understanding of the issues that arise during these projects and the practices that contribute to addressing them, we study the case of Consult, a North American AI consulting firm that helps organisations leverage the power of AI by providing custom solutions. The management of AI projects at Consult is a multi-method approach that draws on elements from traditional project management, agile practices, and AI workflow practices. While the combination of these elements enables Consult to be effective in delivering AI projects to their customers, our analysis reveals that managing AI projects in this way draw upon three core logics, that is, commonly shared norms, values, and prescribed behaviours which influence actors' understanding of how work should be done. We identify that the simultaneous presence of these three logics-a traditional project management logic, an agile logic, and an AI workflow logic-gives rise to conflicts and issues in managing AI projects at Consult, and successfully managing these AI projects involves resolving conflicts that arise between them. From our case findings, we derive four strategies to help organisations better manage their AI projects.","[Vial, Gregory; Cameron, Ann-Frances; Giannelia, Tanya] HEC Montreal, Dept Informat Technol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jiang, Jinglu] Binghamton Univ, Sch Management, Binghamton, NY USA","Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY","Vial, G (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, Dept Informat Technol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",gregory.vial@hec.ca,,"Jiang, Jinglu/0000-0001-6464-9683; Giannelia, Tanya/0000-0003-0253-3313",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture [2018-NP -206971]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture, Grant/Award Number: 2018-NP -206971; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: Canada Research Chair",,47,12,12,50,208,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-1917,1365-2575,,INFORM SYST J,Inf.

A group of graduates from a Master of Project Management program were assessed in an online questionnaire, reflecting the PMBOK's elements of best practices and how AI will affect the project management profession in the future. Different elements of the three knowledge areas were considered to be affected more by AI than others. The schedule baseline is the element believed to be affected the most out of the project schedule management elements. For project cost management, the estimation of resource costs is believed to be affected the most. In the case of project risk management, the application of AI will have the strongest impact on the probability and impact formats.","[Fridgeirsson, Thordur Vikingur; Ingason, Helgi Thor; Jonasson, Haukur Ingi; Gunnarsdottir, Helena] Reykjavik Univ, Sch Technol, Dept Engn, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland",Reykjavik University,"Fridgeirsson, TV (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Sch Technol, Dept Engn, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland.",thordurv@ru.is; helgithor@ru.is; haukuringi@ru.is; helenaxgun@gmail.com,"Jonasson, Haukur Ingi/AAF-3469-2019; Ingason, Helgi/S-2567-2018",,,,,,17,2,2,58,151,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The research was conducted based on a comprehensive survey encompassing a sample of 473 SMEs and large Slovenian enterprises. Methods: To validate the observed differences, statistical analysis, specifically the Mann-Whitney U test, was employed. Results: The results confirm the presence of statistically significant differences between SMEs and large enterprises across multiple dimensions of AI support in project management. Large enterprises exhibit on average a higher level of AI adoption across all five AI utilization dimensions. Specifically, large enterprises scored significantly higher (p < 0.05) in AI adopting strategies and in adopting AI technologies for project tasks and team creation. This study's findings also underscored the significant differences (p < 0.05) between SMEs and large enterprises in their adoption and utilization of AI technologies for project management purposes. While large enterprises scored above 4 for several dimensions, with the highest average score assessed (mean value 4.46 on 1 to 5 scale) for the usage of predictive Analytics Tools to improve the work on the project, SMEs' average levels, on the other hand, were all below 4. SMEs in particular may lag in incorporating AI into various project activities due to several factors such as resource constraints, limited access to AI expertise, or risk aversion. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for targeted strategies to enhance AI adoption in SMEs and leverage its benefits for successful project implementation and strengthen the company's competitiveness.","[Tominc, Polona; Cancer, Vesna; Rozman, Maja] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Oreski, Dijana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Maribor; University of Zagreb,"Rozman, M (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",polona.tominc@um.si; dijoresk@foi.hr; vesna.cancer@um.si; maja.rozman1@um.si,"Oreski, Dijana/AAP-9504-2021","Cancer, Vesna/0000-0003-1637-208X; Rozman, Maja/0000-0002-8546-4351",Croatian Science Foundation [UIP-2020-02-6312]; Slovenian Research Agency (Entrepreneurship for Innovative Society) [P5-0023],Croatian Science Foundation; Slovenian Research Agency (Entrepreneurship for Innovative Society)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),This work was supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under Project UIP-2020-02-6312 and in part by the Slovenian Research Agency (Entrepreneurship for Innovative Society) under Project P5-0023.,,40,1,1,26,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-2688,,AI-BASEL,AI,MAR,2024,5,1,,,,,136,157,,10.3390/ai5010008,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ai5010008,,,22,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,MF0B9,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001192083200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper explores how project managers are adopting and adapting these tools, specifically focusing on ChatGPT, for enhanced project management. Using Adaptive Structuration Theory, the study examines project managers' appropriation of generative AI. It considers factors like Innovation Attitude, Peer Influence, and Task-Technology Fit, employing a survey of Italian project managers. The approach adopted to analyze data is based on Partial Least Square- Structural Equation Modeling. The research confirms the significance of the hypothesized antecedents in AI tool appropriation. Innovation Attitude and Peer Influence are shown to positively impact the creative and 'unfaithful' use of AI in project management. Task-Technology Fit is crucial for effective AI integration, impacting both creative behaviour and unfaithful appropriation. The study highlights the role of an innovative mindset, peer dynamics, and task compatibility in the effective use of AI tools in project management. It suggests potential areas for future research, including exploring cultural and organizational contexts and the rapid evolution of AI technologies. (c) 2024 The Authors.

This study investigates the integration of AI within aviation construction projects, with a focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While AI technologies such as facial recognition, IoT, and biometric systems have advanced airport security and operations, their use in construction project management remains limited. A survey was conducted among 101 engineering professionals and experts with experience or involvement in managing aviation-related construction projects. Participants, many of whom had familiarity with AI tools, provided insights into the applicability of AI in areas such as planning, scheduling, and safety monitoring. The majority agreed that AI has the potential to revolutionize project management processes, improving decision-making, and efficiency. AI tools can predict delays, optimize workflows, and enhance safety through real-time data analytics and machine learning algorithms, reducing risks and human error. Despite the UAE's leadership in AI-driven security advancements, its use in aviation construction is still underdeveloped. This research highlights the potential for broader AI integration across the entire lifecycle of aviation projects. By adopting AI in these areas, UAE airports could set new benchmarks for cost effectiveness, sustainability, and project delivery, reinforcing the region's status as a leader in technological innovation within the aviation industry.","[Alketbi, Mariam Abdalla; Dweiri, Fikri] Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Dalalah, Doraid] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Irbid 22110, Jordan",University of Sharjah; Jordan University of Science & Technology,"Alketbi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",u20106327@sharjah.ac.ae; fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae; doraid@just.edu.jo,"Dweiri, Fikri/F-4221-2019","Dweiri, Fikri/0000-0001-5360-2142",,,,,51,0,0,18,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Data from 12 such organizations were gathered through focus groups to examine the status of AI readiness and PM maturity and to explore their association. The methods used included exploratory data analysis and research on extreme cases. The findings indicated that AI readiness was relatively high in areas of governance and legal aspects but lower in solution development. Conversely, PM maturity was found to be higher in PM but less developed in program and portfolio management. Analysis of extreme cases suggested a positive relationship between AI readiness and PM maturity, supporting the idea that AI can enhance PM.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is written as a critical essay reflecting the experience and reflections of the author with many ideas drawn from and extending selected items from project management, artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics literatures. Findings Neither AI nor sophisticated analytics is likely to elicit hands on attention from project managers, other than those producing AI or analytics-based artifacts or using these tools to create their products and services. However, through the conduit of packaged software support for project management, new tools and approaches can be expected to more effectively support current activities, to streamline or eliminate activities that can be automated, to extend current capabilities with the availability of increased data, computing capacity and mathematically based algorithms and to suggest ways to reconceive how projects are done and whether they are needed. Research limitations/implications This essay includes projections of possible, some likely and some unlikely, events and states that have not yet occurred. Although the hope and purpose are to alert readers to the possibilities of what may occur as logical extensions of current states, it is improbable that all such projections will come to pass at all or in the way described. Nonetheless, consideration of the future ranging from current trends, the interplay among intersecting trends and scenarios of future states can sharpen awareness of the effects of current choices regarding actions, decisions and plans improving the probability that the authors can move toward desired rather than undesired future states. Practical implications Project managers not involved personally with creating AI or analytics products can avoid mastering detailed skill sets in AI and analytics, but should scan for new software features and affordances that they can use enable new levels of productivity, net benefit creation and ability to sleep well at night. Originality/value This essay brings together AI, analytics and project management to imagine and anticipate possible directions for the evolution of the project management domain.","[Niederman, Fred] St Louis Univ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",Saint Louis University,"Niederman, F (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",fred.niederman@slu.edu,,"Niederman, Fred/0000-0003-3246-4769",,,,,104,33,35,16,117,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0959-3845,1758-5813,,INFORM TECHNOL PEOPL,Inf.

However, today many researchers, startups and innovative companies are starting to apply artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and other advanced technologies to the field of project management. By 2030 the industry will undergo significant changes. By using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol this paper explores the intersection of project risk management and AI. The study highlights how AI-driven methodologies and tools can revolutionize the way project risks are managed throughout the project lifecycle. Specifically, 215 papers have been analysed to explore how the scientific community has been moving so far on the topic. Besides, a cross-sectional investigation of the PM processes and AI categories/tools was carried out to identify any path that is prevalent, where the prevalence comes from, and for which PM process or sector it is most successful. Finally, from this study several gaps emerged that scientific research would have to fill to effectively implement AI in PM and that have been turned into opportunities for future research in the form of a research agenda.","[Nenni, Maria Elena] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy; [De Felice, Fabio; De Luca, Cristina; Forcina, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direz Napoli, Dept Engn, Isola C4, I-80143 Naples, NA, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Telecom Italia; Parthenope University Naples,"De Felice, F (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direz Napoli, Dept Engn, Isola C4, I-80143 Naples, NA, Italy.",menenni@unina.it; fabio.defelice@uniparthenope.it; cristina.deluca001@studenti.uniparthenope.it; antonio.forcina@uniparthenope.it,"nenni, maria elena/ABG-1726-2021",,University Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,University Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by University Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

In this activity, students in a graduate-level project management class engaged in real-time conversations with AI-powered chatbots as though they were actual people. Students were required to perform a stakeholder analysis on the key stakeholders involved in their project. This analysis was the first step in developing the communication management plan as a component of the project management plan required to execute the project. To execute this student experience, the instructors built artificial intelligence-powered chatbots by utilizing a free online chatbot character generator located online at www.character.ai to interact with students as though they were actual people. These interactions provided a rich student experience with improved depth of interactions as opposed to the traditional stakeholder analysis methods. Ultimately, in this case, the instructors argue that interactions with AI-powered chatbots enrich student learning and foster critical thinking by providing a more authentic experience. Courses: Small-group, business, project management, professional, and organizational communication. Objectives: By the end of this activity, students will be able to (1) perform a stakeholder analysis on an individual to determine the most effective frequency and mode of communication; (2) identify interpersonal dynamics of the individual of interest, such as their power, influence, and authority relative to their project; and (3) describe interpersonal conflicts between the AI-powered individuals to inform the communications management plan.","[Littell, William Neil] Ohio Univ, Engn Technol & Management, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Peterson, Brittany L.] Ohio Univ, Commun Studies, Athens, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Littell, WN (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Engn Technol & Management, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",littellw@ohio.edu,,,,,,,7,1,1,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1740-4622,1740-4630,,COMMUN TEACH,Commun.

Many EPC contractors struggle with their projects due to the complexity of the decision-making processes, owing to the vast amount of project data generated during each project stage. In line with the fourth industrial revolution, the demand for engineering project management solutions to apply artificial intelligence (AI) in big data technology is increasing. The purpose of this study was to predict the risk of contractor and support decision-making at each project stage using machine-learning (ML) technology based on data generated in the bidding, engineering, construction, and OM stages of EPC projects. As a result of this study, the Engineering Machine-learning Automation Platform (EMAP), a cloud-based integrated analysis tool applied with big data and AI/ML technology, was developed. EMAP is an intelligent decision support system that consists of five modules: Invitation to Bid (ITB) Analysis, Design Cost Estimation, Design Error Checking, Change Order Forecasting, and Equipment Predictive Maintenance, using advanced AI/ML algorithms. In addition, each module was validated through case studies to assure the performance and accuracy of the module. This study contributes to the strengthening of the risk response for each stage of the EPC project, especially preventing errors by the project managers, and improving their work accuracy. Project risk management using AI/ML breaks away from the existing risk management practices centered on statistical analysis, and further expands the research scalability of related works.","[Choi, So-Won; Lee, Eul-Bum] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous & Energy Mat Technol, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Lee, Eul-Bum] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Kim, Jong-Hyun] WISEiTECH Co Ltd, 5th Floor,253 Pangyo Ro, Seongnam 13488, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Lee, EB (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous & Energy Mat Technol, Pohang 37673, South Korea.;Lee, EB (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea.",smilesowon@postech.ac.kr; dreblee@postech.ac.kr; jonghyun@wise.co.kr,"CHOI, sowon/IUP-5746-2023","LEE, EUL-BUM/0000-0001-8885-1798; CHOI, Sowon/0000-0002-7687-0534",Korea Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy (MOTIE) through the Technology Innovation Program funding for Artificial Intelligence and Big-data (AI-BD) Platform Development for Engineering Decision-support Systems project [20002806]; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) through the Technology Innovation Program funding for Artificial Intelligence and Big-data (AI-BD) Platform Development for Engineering Decision-support Systems project [20002806],"Korea Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy (MOTIE) through the Technology Innovation Program funding for Artificial Intelligence and Big-data (AI-BD) Platform Development for Engineering Decision-support Systems project(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea); Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) through the Technology Innovation Program funding for Artificial Intelligence and Big-data (AI-BD) Platform Development for Engineering Decision-support Systems project",This research was sponsored by the Korea Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) through the Technology Innovation Program funding for Artificial Intelligence and Big-data (AI-BD) Platform Development for Engineering Decision-support Systems project (Grant No. 20002806).,,79,30,31,25,118,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2021,13,18,,,,,,,10384,10.3390/su131810384,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131810384,,,33,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UZ0RL,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000701920400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Companies increasingly seize the transformative potential AI entails to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of various business functions. However, studies show that over 85% of all AI projects in organizations fail to be implemented. Therefore, this study investigates the most common AI project management challenges that prevent organizations from successfully deploying AI initiatives. It further explores how the human-centered innovation method design thinking (DT) can address these challenges. To do so, a multiple-case study with a single-unit of analysis was conducted, whereby twenty representatives from ten companies and startups were interviewed. Findings show that in practice, the six most frequently occurring AI project management challenges are: the lack of education around the topic and the resulting distrust in such technology; the missing user-centricity that leads to the development of undesired solutions; the fact that pre-defined solutions hinder project teams from adequately analyzing the business problem first; the insufficient cross-department collaboration and communication; and the absence of high-quality data. Moreover, it was found, that the four overarching DT elements which help organizations tackle these problems are the Needfinding phase, where relevant stakeholders are interviewed and questioned about their pain-points, wishes, and needs at the beginning of the process; the early Prototype Testing where end users can experience the prototypes themselves; the DT Mindset, which entails human-centered thinking, collaboration, integrity, diversity, and empathy, amongst others; and DT as a Process Structure along whichAI-driven projects can be developed. Based on insights from this empirical research, suggestions are made which organizations can follow to directly address AI project management challenges and, thereby, increase their rate of successfully deployed AI projects.","[Staub, Laura] Boston Consulting Grp BCG, Munich, Germany; [van Giffen, Benjamin; Sturm, Simon] Univ St Gallen, Inst Informat Management, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Hehn, Jennifer] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Inst Digital Technol Management, Bern, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Sturm, S (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, Inst Informat Management, St Gallen, Switzerland.",staub.laura@bcg.com; benjamin.vangiffen@unisg.ch; jennifer.hehn@bfh.ch; simongabriel.sturm@student.unisg.ch,,,,,,,42,0,0,11,27,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-48056-0; 978-3-031-48057-7,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,14059,,,,,,251,267,,10.1007/978-3-031-48057-7_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-48057-7_16,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW5EW,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001159622900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results show that the AI methods outperform the EVM/ES methods if the training and test sets are at least similar to one another.

Guided by the dynamic capabilities framework, this study investigated how AI assimilation affects environmental performance, with organizational agility serving as a mediating factor in construction organizations. A moderated mediation analysis was employed in this study to investigate the contingent effect of strategic flexibility in altering the connection between agility and environmental performance. Data were gathered from 308 project managers. The findings of structural equation modeling validated the arguments that AI assimilation increases organizational agility and that this translates to increased environmental performance. Furthermore, strategic flexibility moderates the direct relationship between agility and environmental performance, as well as the indirect relationship between AI assimilation and environmental performance via organizational agility, emphasizing the significance of aligning agile responses with the strategic objectives of the business. The relevance of this research to the field of construction engineering management is that it leads to the integration of AI, improving the environmental performance of the firm through organizational agility. This study shows the moderating function of strategic flexibility in the interrelation between agility and environmental performance. These consequences are aimed primarily at the construction project management sector and policymakers because they emphasize the importance of agile methods of progress of projects to serve the strategic objectives the success of which is vital for environmental sustainability.","[Khan, Ali Nawaz] Hubei Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xiaogan 432100, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Ho Kwong] China Europe Int Business Sch, Dept Org Behav & Human Resource Management, Shanghai 201206, Peoples R China",Hubei Engineering University; China Europe International Business School,"Khan, AN (corresponding author), Hubei Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xiaogan 432100, Peoples R China.",alisial514@gmail.com,"KHAN, ALI/AAJ-9493-2021","Kwan, Ho Kwong/0000-0002-2273-6989",,,,,63,0,0,19,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The problem addressed revolves around the need to effectively manage costs in civil engineering endeavors amidst the growing complexity of projects and the increasing integration of AI technologies. The methodology employed involves the utilization of three MCDM tools, specifically Delphi, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). A total of 17 AI factors, categorized into eight broad groups, were identified and analyzed. Through the application of different MCDM techniques, the relative importance and interrelationships among these factors were determined. The key findings reveal the critical role of certain AI factors, such as risk mitigation and cost components, in optimizing the cost management processes. Moreover, the hierarchical structure generated through ISM and the influential factors identified via MICMAC provide insights for prioritizing strategic interventions. The implications of this study extend to informing decision-makers in the civil engineering domain about effective strategies for leveraging AI in their cost management practices. By adopting a systematic MCDM approach, stakeholders can enhance project outcomes while optimizing resource allocation and mitigating financial risks.","[Hu, Hongxia] Shandong Univ Technol, Business Sch, Dept Accounting, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Shouguo] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Fine Arts, Dept Environm Art Design, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Goswami, Shankha Shubhra] Abacus Inst Engn & Management, Magra 712148, India; [Goswami, Shankha Shubhra; Zhao, Yafei] Blue Bldg Res Ctr, Solearth Architecture BITI Lab, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Capital Normal University,"Hu, HX (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Business Sch, Dept Accounting, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.",huhongxia@sdut.ac.cn,"Zhao, Yafei/AAI-2003-2020; Goswami, Shankha Shubhra/AAQ-5006-2021","Goswami, Shankha Shubhra/0000-0002-0033-3089",University-Enterprise-Partnership Program of Solearth Architecture,University-Enterprise-Partnership Program of Solearth Architecture,"We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all individuals and organizations whose contributions made this research possible.

Quality optimization, including safety and sustainability, plays a key role in construction project management choices. Since the relationship between quality, time and cost can be different from case to case, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed for this purpose. The objective of the research work in this chapter is to demonstrate that AI applications can help project managers the trade-off between time, cost, and quality objectives. A comprehensive approach concerning three estimates of time, cost, and quality of project activities is proposed to optimize project performance in construction. The proposed approach implements a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize project performances, with the aim of creating a decision support system for construction project managers. Genetic algorithm is an AI application that creates a learning optimization process that discards worse solutions and re-introduces better solutions to search for an optimal or sub-optimal solution. Therefore, time, cost, and quality trade-off can be performed by a multi-objective genetic algorithm that evaluates the effectiveness of various combinations, selecting better solutions with an iterative process. Therefore, the most suitable balance between the three project targets can be achieved. A simple case study of a deep renovation project of two residential is presented to evaluate the proposed approach with a sample application. This study contributes to the understanding of AI applications for construction management.","[Bragadin, Marco Alvise; Pozzi, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Bologna, Italy; [Kahkonen, Kalle] Tampere Univ, Fac Built Environm, Tampere, Finland",University of Bologna; Tampere University,"Bragadin, MA (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Bologna, Italy.",marcoalvise.bragadin@unibo.it; luca.pozzi2@studio.unibo.it; kalle.kahkonen@tuni.fi,"Pozzi, Luca/X-6093-2019; Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/G-4335-2014","Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/0000-0002-8986-7721",,,,,33,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-031-25500-7; 978-3-031-25498-7; 978-3-031-25497-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2023,,,,,,,193,207,,10.1007/978-3-031-25498-7_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-25498-7_14,,,15,Architecture; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BX5KO,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001300003400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Code ownership, pivotal in the evolution of such projects, offers insights into developer engagement and potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we leverage the code ownership metrics to empirically investigate the correlation with the latent vulnerabilities across five prominent open-source AI software projects. The findings from the large-scale empirical study suggest a positive relationship between high-level ownership (characterised by a limited number of minor contributors) and a decrease in vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the time metrics, anchored on the project's duration, individual source code file timelines, and the count of impacted releases.

Within the construction industry, knowledge management (KM) is a key part of learning from past mistakes on previous projects. As part of Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the technologies that could provide a potential to the construction industry through gathering knowledge from previous projects to determine future project outcomes. Therefore, this research focusses on AI and its abilities to improve KM for the construction industry in the UK. Qualitative research approach was adopted to collect and analyse the data. A total of 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers within the construction industry. Results show that organisation have already implemented some sort of AI systems within projects and organisations in order to allow for better KM. Combining AI systems into Common Data Environments can help employees in finding documents easier with a unique ID or referenced words. It is concluded that AI systems can be built and used in order to assist with the KM processes that businesses have already implemented. It is recommended that there is a need for developing a business model canvas of implementing AI to benefit from KM within organisations in order to identify the difference between the business processes without AI for KM and with AI being used to assist KM.","[Jallow, Haddy; Renukappa, Suresh; Suresh, Subashini] Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",University of Wolverhampton,"Jallow, H (corresponding author), Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England.",haddy.jallow@costain.com,"Suresh, Subashini/I-2791-2015",,,,,,26,8,8,19,85,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-8963,,978-1-912764-82-2,PROC EUR CONF KNOWL,,,2020,,,,,,,363,369,,10.34190/EKM.20.197,http://dx.doi.org/10.34190/EKM.20.197,,,7,Business; Information Science & Library Science; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BS0SF,,Green Accepted,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000684204300043,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project is a 4 year long, EU-funded project tackling some of the most ambitious research in the fields of biomedical imaging, artificial intelligence and cancer treatment, addressing the four types of cancer that currently have the highest prevalence worldwide: lung, breast, prostate and colorectal. To allow this, clinical partners and external collaborators will populate the repository with multimodality (MR, CT, PET/CT) imaging and related clinical data. Subsequently, AI developers will enable a multimodal analytical data engine facilitating the interpretation, extraction and exploitation of the information stored at the repository. The development and implementation of AI-powered pipelines will enable advancement towards automating data deidentification, curation, annotation, integrity securing and image harmonization. By the end of the project, the usability and performance of the repository as a tool fostering AI experimentation will be technically validated, including a validation subphase by world-class European AI developers, participating in Open Challenges to the AI Community. Upon successful validation of the repository, a set of selected AI tools will undergo early in-silico validation in observational clinical studies coordinated by leading experts in the partner hospitals. Tool performance will be assessed, including external independent validation on hallmark clinical decisions in response to some of the currently most important clinical end points in cancer. The project brings together a consortium of 18 European partners including hospitals, universities, R & D centers and private research companies, constituting an ecosystem of infrastructures, biobanks, AI/in-silico experimentation and cloud computing technologies in oncology.","[Bonmati, Luis Marti; Miguel, Ana] Fe Univ & Polytech Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Valencia, Spain; [Bonmati, Luis Marti; Miguel, Ana] Fe Univ & Polytech Hosp, Grp Invest Biomed Imagen GIBI230, Valencia, Spain; [Bonmati, Luis Marti; Miguel, Ana] Hlth Res Inst, Valencia, Spain; [Suarez, Amelia; Aznar, Mario] Matical Innovat SL, Madrid, Spain; Coll Enseignants Radiol France, Paris, France; Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res, Diagnost Radiol 3, Pisa, Italy; St Andrea Sapienza Rome, Med Traslaz & Oncol, Rome, Italy; Ctr Hosp Univ Porto, Dept Radiol, Porto, Portugal; Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci IRCCS Policlin, Serv Diagnost Immagini, Milan, Italy; Charite, Dept Radiol, Berlin, Germany; Maastricht Univ, Dept Precis Med, Maastricht, Netherlands; Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Comp Sci, Valencia, Spain; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Garching, Germany; Medexprim, Labege, France; Bahia Software SLU, Coruna, Spain; EIBIR Gemeinnutzige GmbH, European Inst Biomed Imaging Res, Vienna, Austria; Univ Valencia, Dept Derecho Constituc Ciencia Polit & Adm, Valencia, Spain; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Software & Informat Syst Engn, Beer Sheva, Israel; Imperial Coll London, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England; QUIBIM SL, Quantitat Imaging Biomarkers Med, Valencia, Spain",University of Pisa; Universidade do Porto; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Maastricht University; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; General Electric; Technical University of Munich; University of Valencia; Ben Gurion University; Imperial College London,"Bonmati, LM (corresponding author), Fe Univ & Polytech Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Valencia, Spain.;Bonmati, LM (corresponding author), Fe Univ & Polytech Hosp, Grp Invest Biomed Imagen GIBI230, Valencia, Spain.;Bonmati, LM (corresponding author), Hlth Res Inst, Valencia, Spain.",marti_lui@gva.es,"Fournier, Laure/HJI-9361-2023; Figueiras Gómez, Sergio/JZT-7832-2024; Penzkofer, Tobias/AFN-1192-2022; Neri, Emanuele/N-1378-2019; Menzel, Marion/H-8952-2016; Alberich-Bayarri, Angel/E-3822-2010; Laghi, Andrea/AAQ-9807-2020; Blanquer, Ignacio/AAH-2524-2020; yang, guang/AAV-2451-2021; Mirsky, Yisroel/JQT-5126-2023; Sardanelli, Francesco/M-2917-2016; BEREGI, Jean-Paul/C-2777-2012; Laghi, Andrea/A-2343-2011; Marti-Bonmati, Luis/A-1147-2015; Neri, Emanuele/F-7231-2012","Penzkofer, Tobias/0000-0001-9591-8575; Suarez-Garcia, Amelia/0000-0002-8359-6836; Figueiras Gomez, Sergio/0009-0003-1680-9269; Laghi, Andrea/0000-0002-3091-7819; Marti-Bonmati, Luis/0000-0002-8234-010X; Menzel, Marion Irene/0000-0003-0087-9134; Neri, Emanuele/0000-0001-7950-4559; Aznar Granados, Mario/0000-0003-4359-9036",Horizon 2020 project (RIA) [952172],Horizon 2020 project (RIA),"CHAIMELEON has been funded by as a Horizon 2020 project (RIA, topic DT-TDS-05-2020-AI for Health Imaging; call SC1-FA-DTS-2019-1, under Grant Agreement No. 952172).",,47,17,17,2,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2234-943X,,,FRONT ONCOL,Front.

AI recommendations were measured based on factors contained within a conceptual AI-driven online recommendation system, while decision-making was measured based on factors such as uncertainty, consequences of decisions, information & goals, motivation, and self-regulation that were designed and validated to examine certain aspects that influence decision-making. IT project contributions were measured based on relevance, risk, reasonableness, basis research return, and business return associated with the project. The research results showed the relationship between IT Project Contributions and IT leader decision was significant in that the leader's perception of IT project contributions towards organizational goals and objectives has a positive influence on the IT project selection decision. Unfortunately, the remaining hypothesized relationships showed no significant outcomes. The research results did not show that IT Leader Decisions may be influenced by AI recommendations, nor the greater knowledge of AI an IT Leader has, the stronger the relationship will be in support of or against AI recommendations, nor that the greater trust in AI an IT Leader has, the stronger the relationship will be in support of or against AI recommendations. This research will provide important insights to understand IT project selection and human-AI collaboration by IT leaders in organizations.","[Judkins, Jarrett T.; Hwang, Yujong] DePaul Univ, Driehaus Coll Business, 1E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Kim, Soyean] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea",DePaul University; Kyung Hee University,"Hwang, Y (corresponding author), DePaul Univ, Driehaus Coll Business, 1E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60614 USA.",Yhwang1@depaul.edu,,,,,,,105,0,0,40,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0266-6669,1741-6469,,INFORM DEV,Inf.

Although these technologies promise business sustainability as well as product and process quality, it seems that the ever-changing market demands, the complexity of technologies and fair concerns about privacy, impede broad application and reuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across the industry. To break the entry barriers for these technologies and unleash its full potential, the knowlEdge project will develop a new generation of AI methods, systems, and data management infrastructure. Subsequently, as part of the knowlEdge project we propose several major innovations in the areas of data management, data analytics and knowledge management including (i) a set of AI services that allows the usage of edge deployments as computational and live data infrastructure as well as a continuous learning execution pipeline on the edge, (ii) a digital twin of the shop-floor able to test AI models, (iii) a data management framework deployed along the edge-to-cloud continuum ensuring data quality, privacy and confidentiality, (iv) Human-AI Collaboration and Domain Knowledge Fusion tools for domain experts to inject their experience into the system, (v) a set of standardisation mechanisms for the exchange of trained AI models from one context to another, and (vi) a knowledge marketplace platform to distribute and interchange trained AI models. In this paper, we present a short overview of the EU Project knowlEdge - Towards Artificial Intelligence powered manufacturing services, processes, and products in an edge-to-cloud-knowledge continuum for humans [in-the-loop], which is funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Framework Programme of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 957331.

Many obstacles, including safety concerns, quality management issues, environmental preservation challenges, economic sustainability, privacy constraints, and legal regulations, weigh heavily on construction projects. However, a beacon of hope emerges in AI-powered drones capable of surmounting these challenges and paving the path to resounding project success. This study employed diverse methodologies, engaging subject-matter experts through interviews and conducting pilot and primary surveys. Our analytical arsenal featured Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) for the pilot survey and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) for the primary survey. Our research revolves around a singular mission: elevating building project success by dismantling the barriers that have impeded the widespread adoption of AI-driven drones in construction. The study's verdict is clear: privacy and legal constraints, coupled with economic and sustainability challenges, alongside human resource management dilemmas, constitute the formidable triumvirate obstructing the ubiquitous embrace of drones in construction. Yet, the impact of breaching these barriers reverberates far beyond overcoming these hurdles. It cascades into public health and safety, environmental conservation, quality management, and economic sustainability, culminating in an amalgam of enhanced Building Project Success. The implications of our findings are profound for the construction industry. They beckon the sector to confront and surmount the legal and regulatory barriers to adopting AI-based drones. A clarion call to invest in human resources to empower technology integration resounds. And, perhaps most importantly, it beckons the industry to embrace the profound economic and sustainability advantages of embracing these cutting-edge technologies. Furthermore, our study underscores that adopting AI-powered drones in construction is not merely about project success; it catalyzes fostering public health, safeguarding the environment, ensuring top-tier quality management, and fortifying economic sustainability. These interwoven facets illuminate the broader canvas of drone technology's transformative role in construction.","[Waqar, Ahsan; Othman, Idris] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia; [Sor, Nadhim Hamah] Univ Garmian, Civil Engn Dept, Kalar, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq; [Sor, Nadhim Hamah] Harran Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sanliurfa, Turkiye; [Alshehri, Abdullah Mohammed; Aljarbou, Mishal] Majmaah Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Al Majmaah, Saudi Arabia; [Almujibah, Hamad R.] Taif Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Taif, Saudi Arabia; [Alotaibi, Badr Saad; Abuhussain, Mohammed Awad] Najran Univ, Coll Engn, Architectural Engn Dept, Najran, Saudi Arabia; [Bageis, Abdulrahman S.] Taibah Univ, Coll Engn, Architectural Engn Dept, Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia; [Althoey, Fadi] Najran Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Najran, Saudi Arabia; [Hayat, Saleh] Univ Chenab, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Technol, Gujrat, Pakistan; [Benjeddou, Omrane] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia; [Alsulamy, Saleh Hamed] King Khalid Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Architecture & Planning, Abha, Saudi Arabia",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; University of Garmian; Harran University; Majmaah University; Taif University; Najran University; Taibah University; Najran University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; King Khalid University,"Sor, NH (corresponding author), Univ Garmian, Civil Engn Dept, Kalar, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq.;Sor, NH (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sanliurfa, Turkiye.",nadhim.abdulwahid@garmian.edu.krd,"Althoey, Fadi/AGX-7523-2022; Benjeddou, Omrane/AHI-3882-2022; Bageis, Dr. Abdulrahman/AAT-4265-2020; HAMAH SOR, Nadhim/AAO-1597-2020; Abuhussain, Mohammed/GWN-0701-2022; Hayat, Saleh/KII-4953-2024; Almujibah, Hamad/CAF-7914-2022","Almujibah, Hamad/0000-0003-1676-6222; Bageis, Dr. Abdulrahman/0000-0003-3592-7095","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University for funding this work.; Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University for funding this work.; Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University(Taif University)","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University for funding this work.",,79,9,9,10,29,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3362,,FRONT BUILT ENVIRON,Front.

Within our qualitative interview study, we asked 25 developers about algorithmic accountability during their AI development projects. We observe that developers' perceived algorithmic accountability depends on organizational factors (i.e., quality management, working method, company structure, and the facets of AI) and personal factors (i.e., understanding of AI-based systems and algorithmic accountability), leading to more scrutinized AI-based systems. Overall, this study contributes to IS development (ISD) research by providing transparency on how developers' perceived algorithmic accountability is affected and how it affects AI development projects. These findings are also relevant for practitioners, as we suggest how they can shape their work environment to promote the positive effects of algorithmic accountability.","[Bartsch, Sebastian Clemens; Adam, Martin; Milani, Verena; Benlian, Alexander] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Bartsch, SC (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.",bartsch@dise.tu-darmstadt.de; adam@dise.tu-darmstadt.de; verena.milani@stud.tu-darmstadt.de; benlian@dise.tu-darmstadt.de,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,HICSS,Honolulu,"Dept IT Mgmt, Shidler College of Business, Univ Hawaii at Manoa 2404 Maile Way D307, Honolulu, Hawaii, UNITED STATES",,,978-0-9981331-7-1,Hawaii Int Con Sys S,,,2024,,,,,,,5826,5835,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX5OE,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001301787505098,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examines the implications of integrating AI tools in software development projects, focusing on potential benefits, challenges, and perceptions of the broader software development community. The study employs a qualitative methodology that captures the sentiments and personal adaptive measures from a diverse group of industry professionals who integrate generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot in their software development projects. Findings suggest that generative AI tools aid developers in automating repetitive tasks, improve their workflow efficiency, reduce the coding learning curve, and complement traditional coding practices and project management techniques. However, generative AI tools also present ethical limitations, including privacy and security issues. The study also raises concerns regarding the long-term potential for job elimination (insecurity), over-reliance on generative AI assistance by developers, generativeAI lack of contextual understanding, and technical skills erosion. While developers are optimistic about the positive benefits of generative AI use within project environments in the short term, they also hold a pessimistic view in the longer term. There is a need for the software development projects community to critically assess the use of generative AI in software development projects while exploring how to retain the critical aspect of human oversight and judgment in the software development process in the long term.","[Mbizo, Takura; Oosterwyk, Grant; Tsibolane, Pitso; Kautondokwa, Popyeni] Univ Cape Town, Commerce Fac, Dept Informat Syst, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Oosterwyk, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Commerce Fac, Dept Informat Syst, Cape Town, South Africa.",takura.mbizvo@alumni.uct.ac.za; grant.oosterwyk@uct.ac.za; pitso.tsibolane@uct.ac.za; ktnpop001@myuct.ac.za,"Tsibolane, Pitso/AAB-7518-2022","Oosterwyk, Grant/0000-0002-2745-3929; Tsibolane, Pitso/0000-0002-7888-1181",,,,,24,0,0,17,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-031-64880-9; 978-3-031-64881-6,COMM COM INF SC,,,2024,2159,,,,,,361,373,,10.1007/978-3-031-64881-6_21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-64881-6_21,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX4WF,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001295291700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Policy makers world-wide nowadays aim to foster environments conducive for AI-based innovation. This paper addresses the current lack of empirical data for evidence-based innovation policies and the management of AI-based innovation. It focuses on AI and innovation management in addressing the question whether innovation that is based on new AI technology requires a management approach different from other forms of IT innovation. We present results from a study of Austrian companies on the degree of use and implementation of AI, and on challenges related to AI-based innovation management. This study used a keyword-list approach to define Artificial Intelligence and to find AI-based innovation projects in research databases. These projects facilitated the identification of experts from organisations developing AI-based innovation. In total, eleven experts were interviewed about their AI-based innovation activities. The results show that AI is a very fast emerging technology that is being applied in many sectors. A broad range of innovative solutions are being developed and some have already reached the market. Specific AI business models are, however, less clear and still developing. Companies are facing multiple challenges from regulation to human resources and data collection. Managing AI-based innovation will be particularly difficult for smaller enterprises, where problems are often more pronounced than in larger industries. Explicit challenges for managing AI-based innovations include the necessary attention to managing expectations and ensuring historic metadata expertise essential for many AI-based solutions. Policies to support AI-based innovation therefore should focus on human aspects. This includes increasing the availability of AI experts, but also concerns the development of new job profiles, such as experts in AI training. AI innovators also require clear AI regulation and research investments in key challenges, such as explainable AI.","[Prem, Erich] Eutema GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Prem, Erich] TU Viennas Informat Innovat Ctr, Vienna, Austria",,"Prem, E (corresponding author), Eutema GmbH, Vienna, Austria.;Prem, E (corresponding author), TU Viennas Informat Innovat Ctr, Vienna, Austria.",,"Prem, Erich/LWH-9981-2024","Prem, Erich/0000-0002-4380-3722",,,,,11,28,29,16,135,CARLETON UNIV GRAPHIC SERVICES,OTTAWA,"DUNTON TOWER RM 2122, 1125 COLONEL BY DR, OTTAWA, ON K1A 5B6, CANADA",1927-0321,,,TECHNOL INNOV MANAG,Technol.

Complications arise from diverging understandings of AI functionality and requirements among involved actors and the difficulties of determining the usefulness of AI in such a complex setting. This article explores a cross-industry project that entailed developing a functional prototype of an AI tool for planning (complex) energy systems in new city districts, engaging both system (domain) actors and AI developers. By analyzing prospective collective sensemaking processes in two episodes from the project, we discovered misaligned sensemaking processes between system actors and AI developers. During the project these actors alternated between seeking and disengaging sensemaking behavior. We highlight how various prototypes supported alignment in sensemaking processes concerning AI and progress in the project. Practitioners can use the managerial implications to better understand sensemaking dynamics in AI projects and implement suitable measures, like education or support at various stages of the project duration, to mitigate the problems that can arise due to misaligned sensemaking processes. PRACTITIONER TAKEAWAYS: Recognize that the diverse actors in AI projects have different sensemaking needs and that gaps in knowledge may exist. Actively monitor for signs of seeking and disengaging among actors, and support behaviors that facilitate prospective collective sensemaking. Use boundary objects to facilitate prospective collective sensemaking, keeping in mind that the level of detail can support actors in different ways.","[Saerner, Elinor; Ystroem, Anna; Holmberg, Gunnar] Engn Linkoping Univ, Dept Management, Linkoping, Sweden; [Ystroem, Anna] Chalmers Univ Technol, Technol Management & Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lakemond, Nicolette] Linkoping Univ, Ind Management, Linkoping, Sweden; [Lakemond, Nicolette] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Holmberg, Gunnar] Linkoping Univ, Machine Design, Linkoping, Sweden; [Holmberg, Gunnar] SAAB Aeronaut, Linkoping, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Saab Group,"Saerner, E (corresponding author), Engn Linkoping Univ, Dept Management, Linkoping, Sweden.",elinor.sarner@liu.se; anna.ystrom@liu.se; nicolette.lakemond@liu.se; gunnar.holmberg@liu.se,"Holmberg, Gunnar/IZQ-1357-2023; Lakemond, Nicolette/C-6197-2015",,"Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program - Humanity and Society (WASP-HS) - Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [2019-0126]","Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program - Humanity and Society (WASP-HS) - Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation","This work was supported by Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program - Humanity and Society (WASP-HS) funded by the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation under Grant 2019-0126.",,57,0,0,15,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0895-6308,1930-0166,,RES TECHNOL MANAGE,Res.-Technol.

However, risk management (RM) is still conducted in a manual, largely ineffective, and experience-based fashion, hindering automation and knowledge transfer in projects. The construction industry is benefitting from the recent Industry 4.0 revolution and the advancements in data science branches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), for the digitalization and optimization of processes. Data-driven methods, e.g., AI and machine learning algorithms, Bayesian inference, and fuzzy logic, are being widely explored as possible solutions to RM domain shortcomings. These methods use deterministic or probabilistic risk reasoning approaches, the first of which proposes a fixed predicted value, and the latter embraces the notion of uncertainty, causal dependencies, and inferences between variables affecting projects' risk in the predicted value. This research used a systematic literature review method with the objective of investigating and comparatively analyzing the main deterministic and probabilistic methods applied to construction RM in respect of scope, primary applications, advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and proven accuracy.

In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top n potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company's risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers.","[Herremans, Dorien] Singapore Univ Technol & Design SUTD, Dept Comp Sci & Design Pillar, Singapore 487372, Singapore",Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Herremans, D (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design SUTD, Dept Comp Sci & Design Pillar, Singapore 487372, Singapore.",dorien_herremans@sutd.edu.sg,"Herremans, Dorien/G-9599-2018","Herremans, Dorien/0000-0001-8607-1640",Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2018-T2-2-161]; SRG ISTD,"Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); SRG ISTD","This work was supported in part by the Singapore Ministry of Education under Grant MOE2018-T2-2-161, and in part by SRG ISTD 2017 129.",,112,5,5,9,43,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9,,,,,,155826,155838,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127548,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127548,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,XG0PI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000724463300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We shift the focus from AI as a worker to ask whether, how, and when AI can also manage human workers who perform such tasks. Focusing on the context of crowd science, we find examples of algorithmic management (AM) in five key functions highlighted in prior organizational literature: task division and task allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning. These applications benefit from the instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities of AI, and reflect several more general underlying functions such as matching, clustering, and forecasting. Quantitative comparisons show that projects using AM are larger and more likely to be associated with platforms than projects not using AM, pointing to potentially important contingency factors. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research on algorithmic management in scientific research.","[Koehler, Maximilian; Sauermann, Henry] ESMT Berlin, Schlosspl 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",European School of Management & Technology,"Koehler, M (corresponding author), ESMT Berlin, Schlosspl 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",maximilian.koehler@phd.esmt.org; henry.sauerman@esmt.org,,,,,"We thank project organizers, software developers, and crowd mem-bers for taking the time to participate in our interviews.

A great deal of earlier research was carried out to optimize the performance of infrastructure projects using traditional management techniques. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were implemented in infrastructure projects to improve their performance and efficiency due to their ability to deal with fuzzy, incomplete, inaccurate and distorted data. The aim of this research is to collect, classify, analyze and review all of the available previous research related to implementing AI techniques in infrastructure projects to figure out the gaps in the previous studies and the recent trends in this research area. A total of 159 studies were collected since the beginning of the 1990s until the end of 2021. This database was classified based on publishing date, infrastructure subject and the used AI technique. The results of this study show that implementing AI techniques in infrastructure projects is rapidly increasing. They also indicate that transportation is the first and the most AI-using project and that both artificial neural networks (ANN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are the most implemented techniques in infrastructure projects. Finally, the study presented some opportunities for farther research, especially in natural gas projects.","[Abdel-Kader, Mohamed Y.; Ebid, Ahmed M.; Mahdi, Ibrahim M.; Abdel-Rasheed, Ibrahim] Future Univ Egypt, Dept Struct Engn, New Cairo 11865, Egypt; [Abdel-Kader, Mohamed Y.; Abdel-Rasheed, Ibrahim] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Engn, Struct Engn Dept, Cairo 11517, Egypt; [Onyelowe, Kennedy C.] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Civil Engn, Umudike 440101, Nigeria",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Future University in Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University,"Ebid, AM (corresponding author), Future Univ Egypt, Dept Struct Engn, New Cairo 11865, Egypt.",ahmed.abdelkhaleq@fue.edu.eg,"Ebid, Ahmed/AAP-9401-2020; Mahdi, Ibrahim/O-6741-2019; Onyelowe, Kennedy/V-8960-2019; Ebid, Ahmed/O-9590-2015","Onyelowe, Kennedy/0000-0001-5218-820X; Yahia, Mohamed/0000-0002-0063-9408; Ebid, Ahmed/0000-0002-3392-4424",,,,,164,7,7,3,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2412-3811,,INFRASTRUCTURES-BASE,Infrastructures-Basel,OCT,2022,7,10,,,,,,,137,10.3390/infrastructures7100137,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures7100137,,,28,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation,5P4OB,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000873130700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experts identified several drivers for AI adoption in SCM, including increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and reduced costs. However, they highlighted several barriers to AI adoption, such as data quality and management issues, resistance to change, and lack of understanding and trust in AI. To overcome these barriers and ensure successful AI implementation, companies should involve all stakeholders, focus on data quality and management, and ensure the AI solution integrates with existing processes and workflows. In addition, companies should also avoid common mistakes when implementing AI, such as neglecting the importance of explainability and transparency in AI decision-making, underestimating the importance of involving all stakeholders, and rushing into large-scale implementation without conducting small-scale pilot projects. By following the recommendations and avoiding common mistakes, companies can harness the benefits of AI in SCM while minimizing risks and challenges.","[Hangl, Johannes; Krause, Simon; Behrens, Viktoria Joy] Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Hangl, J (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xhangl1@o365.mendelu.cz,"Behrens, Viktoria/JTT-4213-2023","Behrens, Viktoria/0000-0002-3145-1694; Winterberg, Simon/0000-0003-0959-0273; Hangl, Johannes/0000-0002-6972-8652",,,,,20,13,13,20,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

To address these challenges, recent research suggests that organizations should develop specific capabilities for AI implementation. Currently, we lack a thorough understanding of how certain capabilities facilitate AI implementation. It remains unclear how they help organizations to cope with AI's unique characteristics. To address this research gap, we employ a qualitative research approach and conduct 25 explorative interviews with experts on AI implementation. We derive four organizational capabilities for AI implementation: AI Project Planning and Co-Development help to cope with the inscrutability in AI, which complicates the planning of AI projects and communication between different stakeholders. Data Management and AI Model Lifecycle Management help to cope with the data dependency in AI, which challenges organizations to provide the proper data foundation and continuously adjust AI systems as the data evolves. We contribute to our understanding of the sociotechnical implications of AI's characteristics and further develop the concept of organizational capabilities as an important success factor for AI implementation. For practice, we provide actionable recommendations to develop organizational capabilities for AI implementation.","[Weber, Michael; Engert, Martin; Weking, Joerg; Krcmar, Helmut] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Garching, Germany; [Schaffer, Norman] Fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany; [Weking, Joerg] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Informat Syst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Technical University of Munich; fortiss; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Weber, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Garching, Germany.",mic.weber@tum.de; martin.engert@tum.de; schaffer@fortiss.org; joerg.weking@qut.edu.au; helmut.krcmar@tum.de,"Krcmar, Helmut/AAA-8434-2020","Weber, Michael/0000-0003-1528-1856",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,61,43,44,36,139,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

Driven by technological advances and public interest, AI is considered by some as an unprecedented revolutionary technology with the potential to transform humanity. But, at this stage, managers are left with little empirical advice on how to prepare and use AI in their firm's operations. Based on case studies and the results of two global surveys among senior managers across industries, this article shows that AI is typically implemented and used with other advanced digital technologies in firms' digital transformation projects. The digital transformation projects in which AI is deployed are mostly in support of firms' existing businesses, thereby demystifying some of the transformative claims made about AI. This article then presents a framework for successfully implementing AI in the context of digital transformation, offering specific guidance in the areas of data, intelligence, being grounded, integrated, teaming, agility, and leadership.","[Brock, Jurgen Kai-Uwe] Fujitsu, Tokyo, Japan; [von Wangenheimz, Florian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management, Technol Mkt, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Brock, JKU (corresponding author), Fujitsu, Tokyo, Japan.",brock.Juergen@fujitsu.com; fwangenheim@ethz.ch,"v.

In the realm of wireless communication, researchers are exploring the use of AI to facilitate various physical layer (PHY) procedures. Within the standardization efforts of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), one prominent direction being explored is AI-based beam management (BM). The primary objective is to harness AI techniques for predicting optimal beams, thereby reducing measurement overhead and latency. This paper aims to discuss the progress made in AI-based beam management within the Release 18 standardization. Furthermore, through our research, we have identified the mobile speed of user equipment (UE) as a crucial factor that impacts the optimal time window size for collecting input data in AI models. We have observed an inverse correlation between UE speed and the time window size. Accordingly, to mitigate unnecessary measurement overhead and latency, we propose that the determination of the time window size for input data collection should be based on the UE speed.

Despite its crucial significance, projects are still underperforming and failing to achieve their objectives. Current research suggests that the emergence of AI promises significant advantages to organisations, particularly for FEP. The purpose of this paper was to explore the readiness of organisations to use AI in the FEP phase to enhance project outcomes. The technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework was used to evaluate factors influencing the readiness to adopt AI in construction projects in Saudi Arabia. Thirty interviews were conducted with public and private stakeholders in the sector. The knowledge and insight gained from the viewpoints of key decision makers and practitioners allowed for an examination of the main factors impacting the adoption of AI, and any challenges and barriers to it. Findings showed that the support of the government and senior management, and the attitudes and behaviour of employees, were the top three factors in the framework that facilitate the readiness of organisations to adopt AI. Government support influences external support and enhances competitive pressure between organisations; senior management support influences the absorptive capacity and maturity of an organisation; and employees' attitudes and behaviours are the main contributors to organisational readiness. The proposed framework will assist policymakers in using these factors to overcome the challenges of AI adoption. Additionally, creating strategies aligned with Vision 2030 focuses not only on choosing the best technology to implement but also on how employees can benefit from it.","[Felemban, Haneen; Sohail, M.; Ruikar, Kirti] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England",Loughborough University,"Felemban, H (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England.",h.felemban@lboro.ac.uk; m.sohail@lboro.ac.uk; k.d.ruikar@lboro.ac.uk,,"Sohail, M/0000-0001-6499-1147",Loughborough University; University of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia,Loughborough University; University of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia,We wish to acknowledge the support of Loughborough University.

Many EPC companies and their clients have realized the benefits of applying AI to their businesses in order to reduce manual work, drive productivity, and streamline future operations of engineered installations in a highly competitive industry. The current AI market offers various solutions and services to support this industry, but organizations must understand how to acquire AI technology in the most beneficial way based on their business strategy and available resources. This paper presents a framework for EPC companies in their transformation towards AI. Our work is based on examples of project execution of AI-based products development at one of the biggest EPC contractors worldwide and on insights from EPC vendor companies already integrating AI into their engineering solutions. The paper covers the entire life cycle of building AI solutions, from initial business understanding to deployment and further evolution. The framework identifies how various factors influence the choice of approach toward AI project development within large international engineering corporations. By presenting a practical guide for optimal approach selection, this paper contributes to the research in AI project management and organizational strategies for integrating AI technology into businesses. The framework might also help engineering companies choose the optimum AI approach to create business value.","[Dzhusupova, Rimma] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Math & Comp Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Bosch, Jan] Chalmers Univ Technol, Comp Sci & Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Olsson, Helena Holmstrom] Malmo Univ, Comp Sci & Media Technol, Malmo, Sweden",Eindhoven University of Technology; Chalmers University of Technology; Malmo University,"Dzhusupova, R (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Math & Comp Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",r.m.dzhusupova@tue.nl,,"Dzhusupova, Rimma/0000-0003-3411-4084; Bosch, Jan/0000-0003-2854-722X","McDermott International Inc and Software Center (Gothenburg, Sweden)","McDermott International Inc and Software Center (Gothenburg, Sweden)","This research has been supported by McDermott International Inc and Software Center (Gothenburg, Sweden).",,67,0,0,24,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0164-1212,1873-1228,,J SYST SOFTWARE,J.

Hence, a key challenge for organizations these days is to implement procedures that can be used to assess and mitigate the risks of organizational AI use. Although public awareness of AI-related risks is growing, the extant literature provides limited guidance to organizations on how to assess and manage AI risks. Against this background, we conducted an Action Design Research project in collaboration with a government agency with a pioneering AI practice to iteratively build, implement, and evaluate the Artificial Intelligence Risk Assessment (AIRA) tool. Besides the theory-ingrained and empirically evaluated AIRA tool, our key contribution is a set of five design principles for instantiating further instances of this class of artifacts. In comparison to existing AI risk assessment tools, our work emphasizes communication between stakeholders of diverse expertise, estimating the expected real-world positive and negative consequences of AI use, and incorporating performance metrics beyond predictive accuracy, including thus assessments of privacy, fairness, and interpretability.","[Nagbol, Per Radberg; Krancher, Oliver] IT Univ Copenhagen, Rued Langgaards Vej 7, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mueller, Oliver] Paderborn Univ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",IT University Copenhagen; University of Paderborn,"Nagbol, PR (corresponding author), IT Univ Copenhagen, Rued Langgaards Vej 7, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark.",pena@itu.dk; oliver.mueller@upb.de; olik@itu.dk,,"Nagbol, Per Radberg/0000-0001-7892-3217; Krancher, Oliver/0000-0003-3876-3604",,,,,36,8,8,4,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-82404-4; 978-3-030-82405-1,IN SY AP IN WE HC,,,2021,12807,,,,,,328,339,,10.1007/978-3-030-82405-1_32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-82405-1_32,,,12,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BX5DP,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001297805200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this paper is to review and compile the current AI methods used for cost-risk assessment in the construction management domain in order to capture complexity and risk interdependencies under high uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach This paper makes a content analysis, based on a comprehensive literature review of articles published in high-quality journals from the years 2008 to 2018. Fuzzy hybrid methods, such as fuzzy-analytical network processing, fuzzy-artificial neural network and fuzzy-simulation, have been widely used and dominated in the literature due to their ability to measure the complexity and uncertainty of the system. Findings The findings of this review article suggest that due to the limitation of subjective risk data and complex computation, the applications of these AI methods are limited in order to address cost overrun issues under high uncertainty. It is suggested that a hybrid approach of fuzzy logic and extended form of Bayesian belief network (BBN) can be applied in cost-risk assessment to better capture complexity-risk interdependencies under uncertainty. Research limitations/implications This study only focuses on the subjective risk assessment methods applied in construction management to overcome cost overrun problem. Therefore, future research can be extended to interpret the input data required to deal with uncertainties, rather than relying solely on subjective judgments in risk assessment analysis. Practical implications These results may assist in the management of cost overrun while addressing complexity and uncertainty to avoid chaos in a project. In addition, project managers, experts and practitioners should address the interrelationship between key complexity and risk factors in order to plan risk impact on project cost. The proposed hybrid method of fuzzy logic and BBN can better support the management implications in recent construction risk management practice. Originality/value This study addresses the applications of AI-based methods in complex construction projects. A proposed hybrid approach could better address the complexity-risk interdependencies which increase cost uncertainty in project.","[Afzal, Farman; Shao Yunfei] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Nazir, Mubasher] Univ Punjab, Quaid I Azam Campus, Lahore, Pakistan; [Bhatti, Saad Mahmood] Univ Engn & Technol, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Punjab; University of Engineering & Technology Lahore,"Afzal, F (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",farmanafzal@gmail.com,"afzal, farman/P-8151-2019; shao, yun/KLC-3238-2024; Bhatti, Saad/IVH-2606-2023","Afzal, Farman/0000-0001-8637-9741; Bhatti, Saad Mahmood/0000-0002-0242-4902",,,,,161,73,74,27,190,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

Project cost is a complex engineering problem due to various factors affecting the construction industry. Accurate cost estimation is important in construction management and significantly impacts project performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been effectively implemented in construction management studies in recent years owing to their capability to deal with complex problems. In this research, extreme gradient boosting is developed as an advanced input selector algorithm and coupled with three AI models, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) for cost estimation. Datasets were gathered based on a survey conducted on 90 building projects in Iraq. Statistical indicators and graphical methods were used to evaluate the developed models. Several input predictors were used, and XGBoost highlighted inflation as the most crucial parameter. The results indicated that the best prediction was attained by XGBoost-RF using six input parameters, with r-squared and the mean absolute percentage error equal to 0.87 and 0.25, respectively. The comparison results revealed that all AI models showed good prediction performance when applied to datasets affected by more than two parameters. The outcomes of this research revealed an optimistic strategy that can help decision makers select the influencing parameters in the early phases of project management. Also, developing a prediction model with high precision results can assist the project's estimators in decreasing the errors in the cost estimation process.","[Ali, Zainab Hasan; Burhan, Abbas M.] Univ Baghdad, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Baghdad, Iraq; [Kassim, Murizah] Univ Teknol MARA, Inst Big Data Analyt & Artificial Intelligence IB, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kassim, Murizah] Univ Teknol MARA, Coll Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Khafaji, Zainab] Al Mustaqbal Univ Coll, Bldg & Construct Tech Engn Dept, Babylon 51001, Iraq",University of Baghdad; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Al-Mustaqbal University College,"Ali, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Baghdad, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Baghdad, Iraq.",zainab.sattar@mustaqbal-college.edu.iq,"Kassim, Murizah/AAC-5879-2020; Burhan, Abbas/AGX-6531-2022; Ali, Zainab/R-5118-2019; Al-khafaji, Zainab/E-5962-2019; Burhan, Dr. Abbas M./B-5550-2019",", Muetasam Ahmad/0009-0000-4785-4351; Ali, Zainab/0000-0003-1916-8164; Kassim, Murizah/0000-0002-8494-4783; Al-khafaji, Zainab/0000-0002-5450-7312; Burhan, Dr. Abbas M./0000-0002-4324-0296","Institute for Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (IBDAAI), Kompleks Al-Khawarizmi, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; Al-Mustaqbal University College [MUC-E-0122]; Universiti Teknologi MARA","Institute for Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (IBDAAI), Kompleks Al-Khawarizmi, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; Al-Mustaqbal University College(Al-Mustaqbal University College); Universiti Teknologi MARA","The authors would like to thank the Institute for Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (IBDAAI), Kompleks Al-Khawarizmi, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), 40450 Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia, for the support in publishing this paper.

In the model, the multidimensional constructs describing the implementation of an agile work environment and artificial intelligence technologies and tools were developed. These multidimensional constructs are agile work environment, agile leadership, agile team skills and capabilities, improving the work of the leader in the project, adopting AI technologies in the project, and using AI solutions in a project. Their impact on successful project implementation and on the company competitiveness was tested. The fundamental reason for conducting this research and developing the model is to enhance the understanding of factors that contribute to the successful implementation of projects and to increase a company's competitiveness. Our developed model encompasses multidimensional constructs that describe the agile work environment and the utilization of AI technologies. By examining the impact of these constructs on both successful project implementation and company competitiveness, we aimed to establish a comprehensive framework that captures the relationship between agility, AI, and successful project implementation. This model serves as a valuable tool for companies seeking to improve their project implementation processes and gain a competitive edge in the market. The research was based on a sample of 473 managers/owners in medium-sized and large companies. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses.

As AI technologies advance, archival professionals must acquire specific skills and knowledge to effectively integrate these technologies into their workflows. The study employs two complementary approaches: (1) a detailed competency framework developed through literature reviews, interviews with archival professionals who have applied AI to the processing of records, and validation workshops with practitioners; and (2) a comprehensive AI literacy framework derived from multiple case studies and theoretical discussions. Our empirical approach to derive these AI competencies for the archival professions is novel in the scholarly literature. Findings indicate that archival professionals can leverage AI in their work practices by acquiring basic AI literacy, practical AI skills, data-related skills, tool-testing and evaluation, adaptation of AI to their workflows, and by actively engaging in collaborative projects with information technology (IT) developers. In addition, there are significant ethical concerns regarding algorithmic biases and data privacy that need to be addressed. We support an interdisciplinary approach that combines archival science, computing, and ethical considerations to develop trustworthy AI solutions. By integrating these fields, practitioners can better understand and manage the implications of AI in their work. Arguments are presented to use our AI literacy and competency framework as a general guide to be refined and situated by archival educators and practitioners for professional development in their own specific contexts. To stay current with technological advances and fully leverage the potential of AI, continuous updates and development of AI literacy among records management and archiving professionals are crucial. This study highlights the need for continued education and interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve these goals.","[Arias Hernandez, Richard] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Rockembach, Moises] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal",University of British Columbia; Universidade de Coimbra,"Hernández, RA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",richard.arias@ubc.ca; moises.rockembach@uc.pt,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(CGIARSocial Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper is an outcome of InterPARES Trust AI, an international research partnership led by Drs.

At the beginning of their studies, students usually only know the basics of IT, primarily related to their personal (mobile) environments, rather than real business scenarios such as business process management or workflow management. This paper explores an innovative teaching concept in the digitalization field for business students. It focuses on how students perceive process automation in workflows using tools like Camunda, especially when tasks involve artificial intelligence (AI) components and decision models (DMN). In this paper, we discuss the decision criteria relevant to the selection of an automation task for business students, examining the criteria students use to choose topics-whether based on difficulty, topic selection (such as supplier selection, project evaluation, product development, etc.), or the relevance to DMN and AI. Additionally, we compare whether there are differences in topic selection between Vietnamese and Swiss students.","[Dannecker, A.; Meyer, L.] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHN, Windisch, Switzerland",FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland,"Dannecker, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHN, Windisch, Switzerland.",achim.dannecker@fhnw.ch,,,,,,,25,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,1865-1356,978-3-031-70444-4; 978-3-031-70445-1,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2024,527,,,,,,324,332,,10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_21,,,9,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BX8UI,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001338400200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

An AI-based inference model, symbiotic bidirectional gated recurrent unit (SBiGRU), was developed for rebar price forecasting. The performance of SBiGRU was compared with other AI techniques, and procurement strategies based on the SBiGRU model were proposed.FindingsThe SBiGRU model outperformed the other AI techniques in terms of rebar price forecasting accuracy. The proposed rebar price forecasting model (RPFM) and procurement patterns, which integrate inventory management principles and rebar price forecasts, were demonstrated to effectively optimize procurement costs, realizing a remarkable 6.13% reduction in procurement expenses compared to the conventional monthly procurement approach.Research limitations/implicationsThe accuracy of AI models may be impacted by disparities in the data used for model training. Future research should explore approaches incorporating price predictions and order factors.Originality/valueThis study significantly extends the bounds of traditional rebar price prediction by integrating AI-driven forecasting with inventory management principles, highlighting the potential of AI-based models to improve construction industry procurement practices, reduce related risks and costs, optimize project operations and maximize project outcomes.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Vu, Quoc-Tuan; Dessalegn, Mamaru; Chen, Jiun-Han] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Cheng, MY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",myc@mail.ntust.edu.tw; tuanvq.0611@gmail.com; d11005815@mail.ntust.edu.tw; m10405906@mail.ntust.edu.tw,"Cheng, Min-Yuan/G-3510-2013","Vu, Quoc Tuan/0009-0000-0142-8461; Cheng, Min-Yuan/0000-0003-1312-4822",,,,,80,0,0,4,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This paper uses artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to predict cash flow trends for Such projects in order to develop appropriate strategies that apply factors such as float, process execution time, construction rate and resource demand to project cash flow control. AI approaches involved in this paper include K-means clustering, genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), and neural network (NN). K-means clustering is employed to categorize similar projects. while the other approaches are used to develop the Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM), a knowledge learning model. FL and NN are employed in the EFNIM to develop a neural-fuzzy model that can deal with uncertainties and knowledge mapping. CA is used to optimize the membership functions of FL and NN parameters globally. The major target of this AI learning is to address sequential cash flow trends. This trained result is furthermore applied to a strategic project cash flow control.

The implementation of a people-centered on-site management method plays a crucial role in providing managers with the optimal solution. In this paper, we presented a human-centric construction resource provisioning approach (CRA-AO) that combines computational intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation in construction projects while providing evaluation feedback. The proposed approach consists of two main parts. First, the concept of time series window is employed to incorporate various construction activities and human resources in the construction network diagram (i.e., an AOV network), leading to the optimal human resource allocation plan using an improved Aquila optimizer. Second, an AI-based method is proposed to train construction quality standards and actual quality parameters through a deep auto-coder, comparing the similarity analysis of the training results. We use actual project time and cost data for analysis and compare it with the cost related index of traditional construction schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CRA-AO approach effectively optimizes construction resource allocation and quality evaluation, enabling a robust project schedule and cost adjustments, while achieving optimized management of construction sites in projects.

It is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use. In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees' jobs more fulfilling - managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.","[Roberts, Deborah L.] Univ York, Sch Business & Soc, York YO10 5DD, England; [Candi, Marina] Reykjavik Univ, Ctr Res Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Business, Menntavegur 1, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of York - UK; Reykjavik University,"Roberts, DL (corresponding author), Univ York, Sch Business & Soc, York YO10 5DD, England.",deborah.roberts@york.ac.uk; marina@ru.is,"Candi, Marina/B-9338-2008","Candi, Marina/0000-0002-5516-0701",,,,,68,7,7,257,296,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4972,1879-2383,,TECHNOVATION,Technovation,AUG,2024,136,,,,,,,,103081,10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103081,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103081,,JUL 2024,11,"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,A1D6Z,,hybrid,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001280014900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper provides a comprehensive review of AI's significant roles in design optimization, construction management, structural health monitoring (SHM), and smart city management. AI enhances the scientific and creative dimensions of civil engineering by optimizing design schemes, generating innovative solutions, and improving efficiency. In construction management, AI streamlines processes by enabling better schedule control, cost and quality management, and safety monitoring. In SHM, AI facilitates more accurate fault detection, health assessment, and lifespan prediction, improving the safety, durability, and resilience of infrastructure. AI's role in smart cities and infrastructure management further supports the efficient governance of urban planning, traffic control, and maintenance operations. However, challenges remain, including integrating AI with legacy infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and security, and overcoming scalability issues in real-world applications. The combination of AI with blockchain technology addresses transparency and security concerns, as demonstrated by emerging pilot projects. Additionally, integrating deep learning with big data will further enhance decision-making capabilities.

The results of a questionnaire survey, which was e-mailed to 14 specialists with solid experience (over twenty years) and knowledge in construction projects, revealed that the probability of the AI phenomenon occurring in Portugal is very high, and its impact on construction projects is equally high. The results also show that RC in combination with the BIM methodology contributes very positively to the mitigation of AI problems in construction projects in Portugal.

However, the area of project management has not yet been sufficiently explored. This study fills the research gap by conducting an empirical evaluation of three well-known LLMs: OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, as well as Google's Bard. The evaluation involves subjecting these LLMs to tests designed to prepare professionals for project management certification by the Project Management Institute. The findings cast a positive light on all three LLMs, with each model achieving scores exceeding 82%. Key insights acquired include: LLMs demonstrate the ability to effectively answer project management certification exam questions; LLMs and project managers should be viewed as a dynamic and complementary partnership; and project management certification should evolve to include an assessment of how project managers collaborate with LLMs to enhance project management.","[Karnouskos, Stamatis] SAP, D-69190 Walldorf, Germany",SAP,"Karnouskos, S (corresponding author), SAP, D-69190 Walldorf, Germany.",karnouskos@ieee.org,"Karnouskos, Stamatis/D-3191-2016","Karnouskos, Stamatis/0000-0003-3519-8232",,,,,68,0,0,29,32,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,2644-1284,,IEEE OPEN J IND ELEC,IEEE Open J.

Meanwhile, other sectors (like manufacturing) adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve complex, non-linear problems to reduce waste, inefficiency, and pollution. Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles' abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas. Finally, the literature review identified three main trends that can be a reference point for future studies made by practitioners or researchers: Digital Twin, Generative Adversarial Networks (with synthetic images) for data augmentation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.","[Rampini, Luca; Cecconi, Fulvio Re] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Rampini, L (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.",luca.rampini@polimi.it; fulvio.rececconi@polimi.it,"Rampini, Luca/GZN-0546-2022; Fulvio, Re/T-1438-2018",,,,,,176,13,13,12,61,INT COUNCIL RESEARCH & INNOVATION BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION,ROTTERDAM,"KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS",1874-4753,,,J INF TECHNOL CONSTR,J.

Within the marine ecosystem, oysters serve as a keystone species. Numerous oyster restoration projects have been launched with a crucial element involving precise assessment of oyster population sizes within specific reef areas. However, the current methods of tracking oyster populations are approximate and lack precision. To address this research gap, the authors developed an AI -empowered project for oyster detection. Specifically, they created a dataset of wild oysters, utilized Roboflow for image annotation, and employed image augmentation techniques to augment the training data. Then, they fine-tuned a YOLOv8 computer vision object detection model using their dataset. The results demonstrated a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.2 percent and an accuracy of 87.7 percent for oyster detection. This approach improved upon previous attempts to detect wild oysters, offering a more effective solution for population assessment, which is a fundamental step toward sustainable oyster restoration project management.","[Zhang, Helen Lv] Allen D Nease High Sch, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32081 USA; [Gui, Yuyue] Washington Univ, Finance Program, St Louis, MO USA; [Lau, Man Fai] Swinburne Univ Technol, Hawthorn, Australia",Washington University (WUSTL); Swinburne University of Technology,"Zhang, HL (corresponding author), Allen D Nease High Sch, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32081 USA.",,,,,,,,86,1,1,6,11,IGI GLOBAL,HERSHEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",1938-0232,1938-0240,,INT J INF TECHNOL PR,Int.

This raises the question of how educators can introduce AI technologies to undergraduate business students while also developing their higher-order thinking skills and preparing them for the complex challenges facing today's business leaders. At the same time, we have also witnessed a growing interest in social entrepreneurship among our student population. To address both needs, we designed and implemented the Innovation Farm, a gamified social entrepreneurship startup project, to help students learn the concepts and applications of AI in an introductory management information systems (MIS) course. The students work in teams to propose AI-powered products and services targeting real-world social issues. The project cultivates social awareness and empathy in students, fosters innovation, and introduces them to current AI technologies while also reinforcing their understanding of MIS course content. Students found the gamified approach engaging, as they are tackling real-world social issues while also learning about innovation, collaboration, branding, and fundraising for a social startup. Students reported positive outcomes related to innovating using technology, making an impact through real-world projects, and practicing their teamwork and leadership skills.","[Chen, Yu] San Jose State Univ, Sch Informat Syst & Technol, Lucas Coll, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Chen, Yu] San Jose State Univ, Sch Informat Syst & Technol, Grad Sch Business, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University,"Chen, Y (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Sch Informat Syst & Technol, Lucas Coll, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.;Chen, Y (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Sch Informat Syst & Technol, Grad Sch Business, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",yu.chen@sjsu.edu; leslie.albert@sjsu.edu; scott.jensen@sjsu.edu,,"Chen, Yu/0000-0002-0612-1482",SJSU Office of Research,SJSU Office of Research,"The authors sincerely thank the SJSU Office of Research, Dr. GillesMuller, Dr. Stacy Gleixner, andDr. ElizabethMullen for theCUREopportunity and support for this project.

The emergence of Industry 4.0 technologies, coupled with the repercussions of COVID-19, increases the urgency and opportunities offered that companies must react to, as disruptive technologies impact how project management (PM) professionals work and necessitate acquisition of new skills. This paper attempts to identify the drivers of and barriers to, as well as the general perception and receptiveness of local PM professionals towards, AI adoption in PM and thereby propose potential strategies and recommendations to drive AI adoption in PM.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs both quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine the findings gathered. A survey questionnaire was used as the primary method of gathering quantitative data from 60 local PM professionals. Statistical tests were performed to analyse the data. To substantiate and validate the findings, in-depth interviews with several experienced industry professionals were performed.FindingsIt is found that top drivers include support from top management and leadership, organisational readiness and the need for greater work productivity and efficiency. Top barriers were found to be the high cost of AI implementation and maintenance and the lack of top-down support and skilled employees trained in AI. These findings could be attributed to the present state of AI technologies being new and considerably underutilised in the industry. Hence, substantial top-down support with the right availability of resources and readiness, both in terms of cost and skilled employees, is paramount to kick-start AI implementation in PM.Originality/valueLittle research has been done on the use of AI in PM locally. AI's potential to improve the productivity and efficiency of PM processes in the B&E industry cannot be overlooked. An understanding of the drivers of, barriers to and attitudes towards AI adoption can facilitate more intentional and directed oversight of AI's strategic roll-out at both the governmental and corporate levels and thus mitigate potential challenges that may hinder the implementation process in the future.","[Shang, Gao] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Pkville, Australia; [Low, Sui Pheng; Lim, Xin Ying Valen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Built Environm, Singapore, Singapore",University of Melbourne; National University of Singapore,"Shang, G (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Pkville, Australia.",shang.gao@unimelb.edu.au; bdglowsp@nus.edu.sg; valenlimnus@gmail.com,,"Gao, Shang/0000-0002-4161-5592",,,,,51,11,11,26,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-124X,2044-1258,,BUILT ENVIRON PROJ A,Built Environ.

The three main constructs of technological devices, advancement, and knowledge were found from the set of drivers with the technique of exploratory factor analysis. The deployment of AI in construction has the potential to improve health and safety and expedite project completion, as this research has evaluated. To figure out how these factors relate to the adoption of AI in the construction industry, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. The study's conclusions showed that the influence of AI installation in the construction industry is reasonably significant thanks to the technology, advancement, and knowledge, contributing around 15 % of the effects that have been directly witnessed.

In this paper, risk assessment is defined, and two examples of risk management frameworks, namely the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework and the non-profit humanitarian effort ForHumanity's Independent Audit of AI, Algorithmic, and Autonomous Systems are briefly described. We identify characteristics of AI applications that need to be assessed for vulnerabilities they may present, such as bias and discrimination. This paper aims to facilitate discussion among stakeholders about the risks that may be encountered from using AI in higher education, as well as to suggest ways developers, decision-makers, and users can mitigate these risks. Much discussion and published literature has focused on risk management frameworks designed for large organizations or enterprises or frameworks that do not consider risks specific to AI. We hope that decision-makers carefully consider the risks, perform due diligence when implementing AI applications, and create a plan for mitigating the risks. This research supports e-learning practice because students and faculty are embracing AI applications. Leaders and decision-makers in higher education need to be proactive in protecting their varied stakeholders. The paper asks what risks may be encountered by institutions of higher education when using AI tools and products in the classroom and for various aspects of decision-making and if published frameworks can mitigate these risks.","[Schaeffer, Donna; Coombs, Lori; Luckett, Jonathan; Marin, Marvin] Marymount Univ, Sch Technol & Innovat, Arlington, VA 22207 USA; [Olson, Patrick] Natl Univ, San Diego, CA USA",Marymount University; National University (California),"Schaeffer, D (corresponding author), Marymount Univ, Sch Technol & Innovat, Arlington, VA 22207 USA.",Donna.schaeffer@marymount.edu; ldc72459@marymount.edu; jpl65485@marymount.edu; m0m61652@marymount.edu; polson@nu.edu,,"Coombs, Lori/0000-0003-1579-9479",,,,,22,0,0,34,34,ACAD CONFERENCES & PUBL INT LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",1479-4403,,,ELECTRON J E-LEARN,Electron.

Lean models are able to manage data obtained from construction projects along with the data obtained from the knowledge base of professional experts (expert survey). The waste management of construction projects under the lean philosophy requires cooperative efforts, where the opinion of professional experts is completely paramount to analyze multidisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, new protocols and disruptive procedures based on artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help decision makers prioritize activities, minimize uncertainty, and avoid wasteful actions that add no value to the project and thus can be minimized or completely eliminated. The vagueness of subjective human judgment in the degree of application of lean waste management in project delivery is modeled by a fuzzy logic model that includes additional considerations related to the lean implementation. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis has been implemented in order to verify and validate the previous digital fuzzy model. In this sense, the main aim of this study is to develop new approaches regarding AI systems, using fuzzy sets and multiple linear regression for managing waste in construction project delivery in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile. A theorized application of the models reveals that the sample (100 construction projects) can be classified into three lean waste condition levels: high, medium, or low waste effects. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the Chilean construction industry environment and will open new ways for harnessing AI-based technology in the construction industry to the fullest potential, to achieve better time and cost predictability with a client- and end-user-centered world view.","[Prieto, A.

Empirical results are synthesized to highlight their relevance from a technology and project management standpoint, identifying several lessons learned that can be used for planning highly integrated and automated smart grid projects. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review leads to selecting 108 research articles dealing with smart grids and AIA applications. Keywords are based on the following research questions: What is the growth trend in Smart Grid projects using intelligent systems and data analytics? What business value is offered when AI-based methods are applied? How do applications of intelligent systems combine with data analytics? What lessons can be learned for Smart Grid and AIA projects? Findings The 108 selected articles are classified according to the following four research issues in smart grids project management: AIA integrated applications; AI-focused technologies; analytics-focused technologies; architecture and design methods. A broad set of smart grid functionality is reviewed, seeking to find commonality among several applications, including as follows: dynamic energy management; automation of extract, transform and load for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems data; multi-level representations of data; the relationship between the standard three-phase transforms and modern data analytics; real-time or short-time voltage stability assessment; smart city architecture; home energy management system; building energy consumption; automated fault and disturbance analysis; and power quality control. Originality/value Given the diversity of issues reviewed, a more capability-focused research agenda is needed to further synthesize empirical findings for AI-based smart grids. Research may converge toward more focus on business rules systems, that may best support smart grid design, proof development, governance and effectiveness. These AIA technologies must be further integrated with smart grid project management methodologies and enable a greater diversity of renewable and non-renewable production sources.","[Khosrojerdi, Farhad] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Akhigbe, Okhaide] Univ Ottawa, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci EECS, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gagnon, Stephane] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Adm Sci, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Ramirez, Alex] Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Richards, Gregory] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Ottawa; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Carleton University; University of Ottawa,"Gagnon, S (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Adm Sci, Gatineau, PQ, Canada.",kjerdi@gmail.com; okhaide@broadbasemetrics.com; stephane.gagnon@uqo.ca; Alex.Ramirez@Carleton.ca; richards@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Gagnon, Stephane/G-4347-2012",,"National Capital Management Research Fund (NCMRF).

Critical pathways and time constraints as well as increased customer expectations have meant that projects have become more risky. Combined with the fourth industrial revolution, Work 4.0, where AI (Artificial Intelligence) and automation play a more important role, new agile project methods such as Scrum and Kanban have been developed. Both classical as well as pure agile project management formats are not always successful if many heterogenous partners are involved. Thus, it has became relevant for merged models to lead to a new form of project management called hybrid project management.

Our focus lies in aligning our study with the ongoing discussions within the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as of December 2022. Instead of evaluating the performance of specific AI models, we take user equipment (UE) receiver (Rx) beam prediction as an illustrative example of AI-based BM. We explore various aspects of AI model management, including model selection, monitoring, and activation/deactivation operations, from a 3GPP perspective. For model selection, we propose deploying distinct AI models for different propagation environments, categorized based on base station (BS) transmitter (Tx) beam measurement results. Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) serves as a pivotal key performance index (KPI) for model performance monitoring. Our simulation results indicate that, instead of training one all-encompassing AI model with numerous layers for universal application, transitioning between domain-specific AI models with fewer layers yields superior performance. Model activation/deactivation procedures determine whether AI-based BM or traditional BM should be employed in a given scenario. We also introduce the use of AI for predicting the performance of both AI-based BM and traditional BM. By comparing the performance of these strategies, we can ascertain whether link performance degradation results from AI output errors or UE movement into challenging propagation environments. This approach enables the effective management of model switching between AI-based BM and traditional BM. The simulation shows that we can reduce the number of unnecessary switches by 10%.","[Sun, Chen; Cui, Tao; Li, Haojin; Bai, Yingshuang; Wu, Songtao; Tong, Qiang] Sony R&D Ctr, Wireless Network Res Dept WNRD, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Le] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Sun, C (corresponding author), Sony R&D Ctr, Wireless Network Res Dept WNRD, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China.",chen.sun@sony.com,"; Tong, Qiang/HZH-9408-2023; Li, Haojin/GLN-6124-2022","Zhao, Le/0000-0003-1653-4034; Tong, Qiang/0009-0003-6261-071X; Li, Haojin/0000-0001-9297-6470",,,,,34,7,7,1,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,2644-125X,,IEEE OPEN J COMM SOC,IEEE Open J.

Although there are numerous applications of AI, there is no state-of-the-art review of how AI applications can reduce net-zero carbon emissions (NZCEs) for sustainable building projects. Therefore, this review study aims to conduct a systematic literature and science mapping review of AI applications in NZCEs for sustainable building projects, thereby expediting the realization of NZCEs in building projects. A mixed-method approach (i.e., systematic literature review and science mapping) consisting of four comprehensive stages was used to retrieve relevant published articles from the Scopus database. A total of 154 published articles were retrieved and used to conduct science mapping analyses and qualitative discussions, including mainstream research topics, gaps, and future research directions. Six mainstream research topics were identified and discussed. These include (1) life cycle assessment and carbon footprint, (2) practical applications of AI technology, (3) multi-objective optimization, (4) energy management and energy efficiency, (5) carbon emissions from buildings, and (6) decision support systems and sustainability. In addition, this review suggests six research gaps and develops a framework depicting future research directions. The findings contribute to advancing AI applications in reducing carbon emissions in sustainable building projects and can help researchers and practitioners to realize its economic and environmental benefits.","[Li, Yanxue; Mohandes, Saeed Reza] Univ Manchester, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, England; [Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour] Aston Univ, Coll Engn & Phys Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham B4 7ET, England; [Anwer, Shahnawaz; Mehmood, Imran; Abdul-Rahman, Mohammed; Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Umer, Waleed] Northumbria Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, England; [Wuni, Ibrahim Yahaya] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Architectural Engn & Construct Management, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",University of Manchester; Aston University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Northumbria University; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Anwer, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",l782290131@163.com; m.antwiafari@aston.ac.uk; shah-nawaz.anwer@polyu.edu.hk; imran.mehmood@connect.polyu.hk; waleed.umer@northumbria.ac.uk; saeedreza.mohandes@manchester.ac.uk; ibrahim.wuni@kfupm.edu.sa; 18042561r@connect.polyu.hk; heng.li@polyu.edu.hk,"Anwer, Shahnawaz/AAW-1994-2020; MOHANDES, SAEED REZA/HTN-4820-2023; MEHMOOD, Imran/JOJ-8153-2023; Wuni, Ibrahim Yahaya/R-3954-2017; Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/ACH-3297-2022; Abdul-Rahman, Mohammed/V-1227-2018; Li, Heng/B-2821-2015","MOHANDES, SAEED REZA/0000-0001-9149-3928; Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/0000-0002-6812-7839; Abdul-Rahman, Mohammed/0000-0002-0568-1744; Mehmood, Imran/0000-0002-8313-2564; Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041","Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme [P0044276, P0050845]; Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme [PolyU]",Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme; Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme [PolyU],"This research was funded by the Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme [PolyU, UGC] grant number P0044276 and P0050845.",,161,1,1,27,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,SEP,2024,14,9,,,,,,,2752,10.3390/buildings14092752,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings14092752,,,26,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,H5A7I,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001323572100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It minimizes manual effort errors, optimizes resource allocation, and improves decision-making processes, resulting in substantial cost savings. The statistical analysis shows that it saves around 53.33% of costs in an experimental project. The transformer model has been trained with a uniquely prepared dataset tailored for SDLC through transfer learning. It achieved impressive results, with an accuracy of 91.5%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.3%, and an F1-score of 91.5%, demonstrating its high reliability and performance. The perplexity score of 15 further indicates the model's strong language understanding capabilities to retrieve relations from complex characteristics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The AI-Analyst framework represents a significant advancement in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SDLC, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for optimizing business processes.","[Faruqui, Nuruzzaman] Daffodil Int Univ, Dept Software Engn, Daffodil Smart City, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh; [Thatoi, Priyabrata] Amazon, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Choudhary, Rohit] Amazon, Dallas, TX 13455 USA; [Roncevic, Ivana] Prince Sultan Univ, Dept Linguist & Translat, Appl Linguist Res Lab, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Alqahtani, Hamed] King Khalid Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Informat & Comp Syst Dept, Abha 62521, Saudi Arabia; [Sarker, Iqbal H.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Securing Digital Futures, Sch Sci, Perth, WA 6027, Australia; [Khanam, Shapla] HELP Univ, Fac Comp & Digital Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Daffodil International University; Amazon.com; Amazon.com; Prince Sultan University; King Khalid University; Edith Cowan University; Help University,"Alqahtani, H (corresponding author), King Khalid Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Informat & Comp Syst Dept, Abha 62521, Saudi Arabia.;Khanam, S (corresponding author), HELP Univ, Fac Comp & Digital Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",hsqahtani@kku.edu.sa; dsk.shapla@gmail.com,"Khanam, Dr. Shapla/ABH-9970-2020; Alqahtani, Hamed/ACZ-1315-2022; Roncevic, Ivana/ABC-2515-2021; Faruqui, Nuruzzaman/JMQ-1466-2023; Sarker, Iqbal/I-8801-2018","Khanam, Dr. Shapla/0000-0003-4012-086X; Faruqui, Nuruzzaman/0000-0001-9306-9637; Roncevic, Ivana/0000-0002-9373-0023; Sarker, Iqbal H./0000-0003-1740-5517",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University through a Large Group Research Project [RGP2/267/45],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University through a Large Group Research Project,This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University through a Large Group Research Project under Grant RGP2/267/45.,,42,1,1,10,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,195188,195203,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519423,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,Q6G0F,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001385626400050,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is a limited amount of research that has evaluated AI tools' performance in risk management. Therefore, with the intention of sustaining more accurate risk-based decision-making process in the construction industry, this paper investigates the accuracy of ChatGPT in risk management for different project types. In this context, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to each risk management sub-process were determined, and then a questionnaire that consisted of prompt templates was prepared for collecting data from ChatGPT. Afterwards, ChatGPT's responses were evaluated by experts with focus group sessions. The findings indicate that ChatGPT has a moderate level of performance in managing risks. It provides more accurate knowledge in risk response and risk monitoring rather than risk identification and risk analysis sub-processes. This research paves the way for future studies by demonstrating an implication of ChatGPT use for risk-based decision making. In addition, gaining insight into the precision of ChatGPT in the risk-based decision-making process will empower decision-makers to establish resilience in business operations through technology-driven risk management.","[Aladag, Hande] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkiye",Yildiz Technical University,"Aladag, H (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkiye.",haladag@yildiz.edu.tr,"Aladag, Hande/JBS-4959-2023",,,,,,54,9,9,28,85,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2023,15,22,,,,,,,16071,10.3390/su152216071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152216071,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AQ4V6,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001119923000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As organizations strive to consolidate the competitive market, their success is often measured by their agility and resilience. Such agility stems from the underlying management practices that an organization embraces and is crucial for the effective planning and delivery of large-scale projects. While management philosophies have continued to evolve, organizations specializing in software development have increasingly adopted Agile project management practices to keep up with a disruptive landscape inundated with rapidly emerging technological advancements. As organizations have continued to expand globally, the existing Agile practices have been laggard and sluggish, unable to keep up with the demands of a modern market. In this context, the authors introduce an Agile project management framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate efficient management of large projects.","[Dhruva, G.; Shettigar, Ishaan; Parthasarthy, Srikrshna; Sapna, V.

This paper investigates expectations of two groups of enterprises from different application domains towards the organizational AI use. The results of the study indicate that often the technology is put into the focus rather than the organizational context which leads to neglecting requirements regarding process integration or data availability. As a consequence, the paper proposes a method component adding to enterprise architecture management, which describes how the organizational context of AI can be determined as support for AI requirements analysis and feasibility studies.

Construction cost projections greatly support managers' decision-making processes, and risk assessment models reduce time delay. The cost of construction projects may be modeled and forecasted using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches that require a huge amount of data. Hence, this paper proposes an AI-driven construction cost estimation and control analysis (AI-CCECA) model for analyzing the preliminary cost of building projects and dynamic management of the control system. The first step is to identify the most significant cost components and variables that affect overall building costs based on real-world data gathered from project bids and deep neural networks. As a result of this research, construction firms will benefit from improved operational efficiency and competitiveness from its ML and optimization framework. Machine learning could improve the cost estimation in the program phase of the construction process. Workflow optimization for cost savings and practical consequences for data-driven management may be achieved using machine learning models, as shown by the findings of this study.","[Yi, Zhouxin] CSCEC Southwest Consulting Co Ltd, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiu] Chengdu Technol Univ, Chengdu 611730, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Chengdu Technological University,"Luo, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Technol Univ, Chengdu 611730, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",starrats32@163.com; lxiu1@cdtu.edu.cn,,,Research on Engineering Cost Management of Prefabricated Buildings in Colleges and Universities in the Implementation Stage Based on BIM technology-A case,Research on Engineering Cost Management of Prefabricated Buildings in Colleges and Universities in the Implementation Stage Based on BIM technology-A case,This work was supported by Research on Engineering Cost Management of Prefabricated Buildings in Colleges and Universities in the Implementation Stage Based on BIM technology-A case study of the proposed student dormitory project.,,27,3,3,60,180,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2228-6160,2364-1843,,IJST-T CIV ENG,Iran.

Despite the hype and popularity of AI, there is a noticeable scarcity of research focusing on AI's potential role in enriching and augmenting organizational knowledge. This paper develops a recursive theory of knowledge augmentation in organizations (the KAM model) based on a synthesis of extant literature and a four-year revised canonical action research project. The project aimed to design and implement a human-centric AI (called Project) to solve the lack of integration of tacit and explicit knowledge in a scientific research center (SRC). To explore the patterns of knowledge augmentation in organizations, this study extends Nonaka's SECI (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) model by incorporating the human-in-the-loop Informed Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach. The proposed design offers the possibility to integrate experts' intuition and domain knowledge in AI in an explainable way. The findings show that organizational knowledge can be augmented through a recursive process enabled by the design and implementation of human-in-the-loop IAI. The study has important implications for research and practice.","[Harfouche, Antoine; Quinio, Bernard] Paris Nanterre Univ, 200 Av Republ, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Saba, Mario] Business Sch Lausanne, Rte La Maladiere 21, CH-1022 Chavannes Pres Renens, Switzerland; [Saba, Peter Bou] Leonard Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, France",,"Harfouche, A (corresponding author), Paris Nanterre Univ, 200 Av Republ, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",antoine.h@parisnanterre.fr,"QUINIO, Bernard/LOS-0630-2024; Harfouche, Antoine/ABD-3392-2022; Bou Saba, Peter/J-1733-2016","Harfouche, Antoine/0000-0002-0407-9217; Bou Saba, Peter/0000-0002-6412-5051",,,,,55,14,15,39,143,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

J,"Celsi, LR",,,,"Celsi, Lorenzo Ricciardi",,,The Dilemma of Rapid AI Advancements: Striking a Balance between Innovation and Regulation by Pursuing Risk-Aware Value Creation,INFORMATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,AI Act; AI regulation; AI risk,,"This paper proposes the concept of risk-aware actual value as a pivotal metric for evaluating the viability and desirability of AI projects and services in accordance with the AI Act. The framework establishes a direct correlation between the level of risk associated with a product or service and the resulting actual value generated. The AI Act reflects a concerted effort to harness the potential of AI while mitigating risks. The risk-based approach aligns regulatory measures with the specific attributes and potential hazards of distinct AI applications. As trilogue negotiations continue, the regulatory approach of the EU is evolving, highlighting its commitment to responsible and forward-thinking AI governance. Through a dedicated analysis of the AI Act, it becomes evident that products or services categorized as high-risk carry substantial compliance obligations, consequently diminishing their potential value. This underscores the imperative of exercising caution when engaging in projects with elevated risk profiles. Conversely, products or services characterized by lower risk levels are poised to accrue more substantial benefits from their AI and data potential, highlighting the incentive for a discerning approach to risk assessment. Methodologically, we propose an extension of an integrated AI risk management framework that is already existing in the literature, combining it with existing frameworks for measuring value creation from harnessing AI potential. Additionally, we contribute to the applied field of AI by implementing the proposed risk framework across nine industry-relevant use cases. In summation, this paper furnishes a comprehensive approach to achieving equilibrium between innovation and regulation in the realm of AI projects and services.

A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias.

It is especially true for tunnel projects where technicality and complexity increase the risks, uncertainties, and challenges of realistic risk identification. However, two important issues need to be addressed in the current risk identification practice. First is the organization of previous project risk information (data) in unstructured and semistructured formats which hinders the use of emerging AI-based techniques and digitization of the risk management process. Second, overreliance on manual efforts and human experience, which is labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent question-answering system based on a knowledge graph and generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model. This study developed a tunnel risk knowledge graph (TRisKG) and then integrated the TRisKG with a GPT model to develop a question-answering system for tunnel project risks (QASTRisk). The proposed QASTRisk yielded a precision value of 97%, recall of 94%, and an F-1 score of 95%, indicating excellent performance compared to the existing studies. The proposed approach is appropriate for quick, effective, and intuitive risk identification at the early stage of tunnel projects as it can facilitate timely and reliable decision-making to prevent safety accidents and reduce project delays and cost overruns. Also, this work contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a framework for developing intelligent systems using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist project managers in automatic and efficient risk identification at the preconstruction phase of the project. Thus, this enhances decision-making, improves project performance and the efficiency of project risk management practices, and increases productivity in the construction industry.","[Isah, Muritala Adebayo; Kim, Byung-Soo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 80 Daehakro, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU),"Kim, BS (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 80 Daehakro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",isahmuritala@knu.ac.kr; bskim65@knu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Byung-Soo/0000-0003-1155-4159",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT) [NRF-2021R1A2C1014267],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (NRF-2021R1A2C1014267).,,63,0,0,42,42,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This study fills this knowledge gap by analyzing previous research to investigate the influence of emerging technologies on shaping project management principles. We used the normative method preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to screen 1647 titles and abstracts and finally analyze 121 full papers.

As a result, many AI investments have stalled at the prototype level, never reaching clinical settings. Objective: To improve the chances of future AI implementation projects succeeding, we analyzed the experiences of clinical AI system implementers to better understand the challenges and success factors in their implementations. Methods: Thirty-seven implementers of clinical AI from European and North and South American countries were interviewed. Semi -structured interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively with the framework method, identifying the success factors and the reasons for challenges as well as documenting proposals from implementers to improve AI adoption in clinical settings. Results: We gathered the implementers' requirements for facilitating AI adoption in the clinical setting. The main findings include 1) the lesser importance of AI explainability in favor of proper clinical validation studies, 2) the need to actively involve clinical practitioners, and not only clinical researchers, in the inception of AI research projects, 3) the need for better information structures and processes to manage data access and the ethical approval of AI projects, 4) the need for better support for regulatory compliance and avoidance of duplications in data management approval bodies, 5) the need to increase both clinicians' and citizens' literacy as respects the benefits and limitations of AI, and 6) the need for better funding schemes to support the implementation, embedding, and validation of AI in the clinical workflow, beyond pilots. Conclusion: Participants in the interviews are positive about the future of AI in clinical settings. At the same time, they propose numerous measures to transfer research advances into implementations that will benefit healthcare personnel. Transferring AI research into benefits for healthcare workers and patients requires adjustments in regulations, data access procedures, education, funding schemes, and validation of AI systems.","[Marco-Ruiz, Luis; Hernandez, Miguel Angel Tejedor; Ngo, Phuong Dinh; Makhlysheva, Alexandra; Svenning, Therese Olsen; Dyb, Kari; Chomutare, Taridzo; Tayefi, Maryam] Univ Hosp North Norway, Norwegian Ctr Ehlth Res, Tromso, Norway; [Llatas, Carlos Fernandez] Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Inst Tecnol Informac & Comunicac ITACA, Valencia, Spain; [Munoz-Gama, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University Hospital of North Norway; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Marco-Ruiz, L (corresponding author), Univ Hosp North Norway, Norwegian Ctr Ehlth Res, Tromso, Norway.",luis.marco.ruiz@ehealthresearch.no,"Marco-Ruiz, Luis/LPQ-6748-2024; Munoz-Gama, Jorge/E-7135-2013; Ngo, Phuong/AAK-7338-2021",,Norwegian Centre for E-health Research,Norwegian Centre for E-health Research,This study was funded by the Norwegian Centre for E-health Research.

J,"Eber, W",,,,"Eber, Wolfgang",,,Potentials of artificial intelligence in construction management,ORGANIZATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Building Information Model (BIM); complexity; construction management; real-estate management; artificial intelligence; coordination; organisation,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been developed since the upcoming of Information Technologies beginning in the 1950s. With rising computing power, the discussion of AI usefulness has been refuelled by new powerful algorithms and, in particular, the availability of the internet as a vast resource of unstructured data. This gives hope to construction management in particular, since construction projects are recently becoming larger and more complex, i.e. encompassing more and more participants focusing on diverging interests while the given frames of time and budget are getting tighter. Finally, construction management is used to establish an efficient organisation of all these issues and able to predict the result with a high degree of precision and certainty. This could be accomplished by the human mind when projects were smaller, but with the recent development human mind is clearly pushed to its limits. On this background, the possible support of AI to organisational tasks needs to be investigated on a theoretical level prior to developing tools. This paper is the extended version of the article 'Artificial Intelligence in Construction Management a Perspective', presented at the Creative Construction Conference 2019 where the algorithmic and entropic scope of AI is investigated in the context of construction management. However, efficient organisation is about restructuring systems into a set of well-separated subsystems, where human intelligence is required to bring in mainly two higher principles which AI fails to provide: the ability to prioritise and creativity allowing for new approaches not derived from given data. This paper additionally focuses on the aspect of in-situ coordination. This service is an aspect of organisation which is not separable and can therefore only be treated as self-determined subsystem, located outside of hierarchical control. At this point algorithms of AI need to be investigated not so much as to substitute human mind but to provide significant support.","[Eber, Wolfgang] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Construct Management, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Eber, W (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Construct Management, Munich, Germany.",eb@bv.tum.de,,,,,,,40,14,14,7,95,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1847-5450,1847-6228,,ORGAN TECHNOL MANAG,Organ.

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail.","[Cubric, Marija] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Cubric, M (corresponding author), Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",m.cubric@herts.ac.uk,,"Cubric, Marija/0000-0001-6699-3576",,,,,37,149,155,32,221,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

Within this approach, we outline the process of use case planning, involving ideation, scoping, and assessment. The systematic collection and storage of specific use case data foster transparency and the creation of a knowledge base, facilitating data-driven decisions for AI use case portfolio management. This decision-making process is based on key dimensions such as value and feasibility, which are further broken down into sub-dimensions, including strategic value, financial value, data complexity, model complexity, required expertise, integration complexity, and risk classification. To validate the proposed approach, we apply it to real-world scenarios and conduct eight case studies to evaluate its effectiveness and practicality. Our approach enables different business stakeholders to collaborate effectively and create a standardized description and evaluation of AI use cases. This standardization not only ensures consistency and reuse across projects but also enhances the collective understanding and assessment of AI initiatives within and across organizations.","[Bodendorf, Frank] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Bodendorf, F (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.",frank.bf.bodendorf@bmw.de,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1019-6781,1422-8890,,ELECTRON MARK,Electron.

This paper focuses on automating the classification of EIR paragraphs according to the ISO 19650 standard's categories, aiming to improve information management in construction projects. It addresses a gap in applying AI to enhance BIM project management, where barriers often include technological limitations, a shortage of specialists, and limited understanding of the methodology. The proposed method uses Word2Vec for text vectorisation and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with an RBF kernel for text classification, and it attempts to apply Word2Vec with cosine similarity for text generation. The model achieved an average F1 score of 0.7, with predicted categories for provided sentences and similar matches for selected phrases. While the text classification results were promising, further refinement is required for the text generation component. This study concludes that integrating AI tools such as Word2Vec and SVM offers a feasible solution for enhancing EIR creation.

We first present a general introduction to the project and its ambitions in terms of use cases (UCs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and key value indicators (KVIs). Then, we identify the key challenges to realize, implement, and enable the native integration of AI and ML in 6G, both as a means for designing flexible, low-complexity, and reconfigurable networks (learning to communicate), and as an intrinsic in-network intelligence feature (communicating to learn or, 6G as an efficient AI/ML platform). We present a high level description of down selected technical enablers and their implications on the Hexa-X identified UCs, KPIs and KVIs. Our solutions cover lower layer aspects, including channel estimation, transceiver design, power amplifier and distributed MIMO related challenges, and higher layer aspects, including AI/ML workload management and orchestration, as well as distributed AI. The latter entails Federated Learning and explainability as means for privacy preserving and trustworthy AI. To bridge the gap between the technical enablers and the 6G targets, some representative numerical results accompany the high level description. Overall, the methodology of the paper starts from the UCs and KPIs/KVIs, to then focus on the proposed technical solutions able to realize them. Finally, a brief discussion of the ongoing regulation activities related to AI is presented, to close our vision towards an AI and ML-driven communication and computation co-design for 6G.","[Merluzzi, Mattia] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CEA, Leti, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Borsos, Tamas] Ericsson Res, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Rajatheva, Nandana; Dampahalage, Dilin; Rajapaksha, Nuwanthika] Univ Oulu, Ctr Wireless Commun, Oulu 90570, Finland; [Benczur, Andras A.] ELKH Inst Comp Sci & Control, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary; [Farhadi, Hamed; Haraldson, Johan] Ericsson Res, S-16483 Stockholm, Sweden; [Yassine, Taha] Inst Res Technol Bcom, F-35510 Cesson Sevigne, France; [Yassine, Taha] Univ Rennes, CNRS, IETR UMR 6164, INSA Rennes, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Mueck, Markus Dominik; Filippou, Miltiadis C.; Baltar, Leonardo Gomes] Intel Deutschland GmbH, Munich, Germany; [Barmpounakis, Sokratis; Demestichas, Panagiotis; Lamprousi, Vasiliki] WINGS ICT Solut, Athens 17121, Greece; [Ducange, Pietro; Marcelloni, Francesco; Renda, Alessandro] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Filippou, Miltiadis C.] Nokia Bell Labs, D-81541 Munich, Germany; [Karacay, Leyli] Ericsson Res, TR-34390 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Korpi, Dani; Uusitalo, Mikko A.] Nok Bell Labs, Espoo 02610, Finland; [Mohammadi, Jafar] Nokia Bell Labs, D-70435 Stuttgart, Germany",CEA; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Ericsson; University of Oulu; Ericsson; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Universite de Rennes; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Rennes; Intel Corporation; Intel Germany; University of Pisa; Nokia Corporation; NOKIA GERMANY; Nokia Corporation; NOKIA GERMANY,"Merluzzi, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CEA, Leti, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",mattia.merluzzi@cea.fr,"Marcelloni, Francesco/AAA-4495-2021; Filippou, Miltiades/W-8564-2019; Ducange, Pietro/S-3955-2019; Renda, Alessandro/JUV-1403-2023; Farhadi, Hamed/AAM-6109-2020; Korpi, Dani/Y-9424-2019; Dampahalage, Dilin/AEI-5411-2022; Barmpounakis, Sokratis/ABC-5293-2020; Farhadi, Hamed/L-6334-2016","Dampahalge, Dilin/0000-0002-6218-500X; Andras, Benczur/0000-0002-9392-0986; Renda, Alessandro/0000-0002-0482-5048; Farhadi, Hamed/0000-0001-9853-2977; Mueck, Markus/0000-0002-0944-5378; Yassine, Taha/0000-0001-6358-6860; Merluzzi, Mattia/0000-0001-8538-1268; Rajatheva, Nandana/0000-0002-7029-5583",European Commission through the H2020 Project Hexa-X [101015956],European Commission through the H2020 Project Hexa-X,This work was supported in part by the European Commission through the H2020 Project Hexa-X under Grant 101015956.,,104,11,11,4,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,65620,65648,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287939,,,29,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,L8BT9,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001025466000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these techniques could be more powerful if combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and numeric sources of data in multimodal pipelines. We present several recent examples, where United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers and collaborators are using AI methods with text and images to improve core scientific knowledge, the management of agricultural research, and agricultural practice. NLP enables automated indexing, clustering, and classification for agricultural research project management. We explore two case studies where combining techniques and data sources in new ways could accelerate progress in personalized nutrition and invasive pest detection. One challenge in applying these techniques is the difficulty in obtaining high-quality training data. Other challenges are a lack of machine learning (ML) techniques customized for use and ML skills or experience among researchers and other stakeholders.

Since intragroup dynamics is a key factor affecting team performance, this paper is the result of the study conducted as part of the Group Dynamics and Communications course at National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine (NULES) to determine the potential of using AI tools as tools to support the group dynamics of self -organised teams during the implementation of educational projects. Based on the results of the free choice of project and team management tools, we categorised three groups among the 56 participants of the experiment according to the use or non-use of AI tools to enhance group dynamics, followed by self -assessment of the effectiveness of the selected tools in increasing their levels of self -efficacy and social engagement. The survey was based on a Likert scale measurement, and non -parametric methods of analysis and statistical hypothesis testing were used to process the results. The self -assessment confirmed that the incorporation of AI tools in the implementation of a team -based learning project did not influence the improvement of students' social engagement and the dynamics of self -efficacy for both effective and ineffective students. The authors identified the positive impact of using AI tools on its development for students with the average level of self -efficacy. We also presented an example of the use of Notion AI for enhancing group dynamics at each stage of team development according to B. Tuckman. The authors suggest that the impact of using AI tools in the process of implementing a group learning project depends more on personal characteristics of team members than on the choice of a specific AI model. Determination of application specifics of individual AI tools in the process of training future specialists in the implementation of various types of educational activities, particularly ethical considerations is recognised as an area for further research.","[Kuzminska, Olena] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Kiev, Ukraine; [Pohrebniak, Denys] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Educ Programme Software Informat Syst, Kiev, Ukraine; [Mazorchuk, Mariia] Ukrainian Ctr Educ Qual Assessment, Res & Analyt Dept, Kiev, Ukraine; [Osadchyi, Viacheslav] Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Metropolitan Univ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Osadchyi, Viacheslav] Natl Acad Educ Sci Ukraine, Inst Digitalisat Educ, Kiev, Ukraine",National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Metropolitan University; National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine; Institute for Digitalisation of Education of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine,"Kuzminska, O (corresponding author), Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Kiev, Ukraine.",o.kuzminska@nubip.edu.ua; pogrib7@gmail.com; mazorchuk.mary@gmail.com; v.osadchyi@kubg.edu.ua,"Kuzminska, Olena/U-7610-2017; Mariia, Mazorchuk/B-7903-2019; Osadchyi, Viacheslav/I-8586-2016","Mariia, Mazorchuk/0000-0002-4416-8361; Osadchyi, Viacheslav/0000-0001-5659-4774",European Union [101048229 - EU4OH - ERASMUS - JMO - 2021 - HEI - TCH - RSCH],European Union(European Union (EU)),The study was conducted in the framework of the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet project Integration EU One Health framework and policies in Ukraine (101048229 - EU4OH - ERASMUS - JMO - 2021 - HEI - TCH - RSCH) co-funded by the European Union.

PROCESS macro was used to analyze the data to generate empirical results.FindingsThe results suggest that instrumental AI use indirectly influences ISD team performance by enhancing team psychological empowerment. Additionally, it moderates the effects of team-level LMX on team psychological empowerment and ISD team performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the interaction effect of LMX and instrumental AI use on ISD team performance is mediated by team psychological empowerment.Originality/valueWhile research on ISD consistently demonstrates that teams, data, and technology collectively contribute to the success of these projects. What is less known, however, is how the exchange relationship between ISD teams and their leader, as well as technological factors, contribute to ISD projects. This study draws on LMX theory to propose how team-level LMX and the instrumental use of AI by team members influence team psychological empowerment and ISD team performance. The study puts forth a mediated moderation model to develop a set of hypotheses. It offers valuable contributions to AI and LMX, along with implications for ISD team management.","[Ali, Ahsan; Xue, Xianfang] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Nan] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xicheng] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Tariq, Hussain] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, KFUPM Business Sch, Dept Management & Mkt, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Tariq, Hussain] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Finance & Digital Econ I, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Beijing Technology & Business University; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Wang, N (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangnan5819356@163.com,"Ali, Ahsan/AAU-7693-2020; Tariq, Hussain/Q-2924-2019","Ali, Ahsan/0000-0002-1079-804X","Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [11212932612215]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72301136]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [23TQC003]; Innovation Centre for Digital Business and Capital Development of Beijing Technology and Business University [SZSK202213]","Zhejiang Sci-Tech University(Zhejiang Sci-Tech University); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China; Innovation Centre for Digital Business and Capital Development of Beijing Technology and Business University","This study was supported by the research start-up fund of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (11212932612215), National Natural Science Foundation of China (72301136), the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (23TQC003), and Innovation Centre for Digital Business and Capital Development of Beijing Technology and Business University (SZSK202213).",,76,6,6,60,76,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

As part of sewer infrastructure, sewer systems are prone to degradation. Traditional maintenance methods for sewer systems are largely manual and reactive and rely on inconsistent data, leading to inefficient maintenance. The KaSyTwin research project addresses the urgent need for efficient and resilient sewer system management methods in Germany, aiming to develop a methodology for the semi-automated development and utilization of digital twins of sewer systems to enhance data availability and operational resilience. Using advanced multi-sensor robotic platforms equipped with scanning and imaging systems, i.e., laser scanners and cameras, as well as artificial intelligence (AI), the KaSyTwin research project focuses on generating digital twin-enabled representations of sewer systems in real time. As a project report, this work outlines the research framework and proposed methodologies in the KaSyTwin research project. Digital twins of sewer systems integrated with AI technologies are expected to facilitate proactive maintenance, resilience forecasting against extreme weather events, and real-time damage detection. Furthermore, the KaSyTwin research project aspires to advance the digital management of sewer systems, ensuring long-term functionality and public welfare via on-demand structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing.","[Hartmann, Sabine; Valles, Raquel; Goelzhaeuser, Peter; Jaekel, Jan-Iwo; Mackenbach, Sven; Klemt-Albert, Katharina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair & Inst Construct Management Digital Engn & R, D-52070 Aachen, Germany; [Schmitt, Annette; Jung, Jan Thomas; Villinger, Georg; Merkle, Dominik Robert; Reiterer, Alexander] Univ Freiburg, Dept Sustainable Syst Engn, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Schmitt, Annette; Jung, Jan Thomas; Villinger, Georg; Merkle, Dominik Robert; Reiterer, Alexander] Fraunhofer Inst Phys Measurement Tech IPM, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Al-Zuriqat, Thamer; Dragos, Kosmas; Smarsly, Kay] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Digital & Autonomous Construct, D-21079 Hamburg, Germany; [Varela Rojas, Diana; Bergmann, Matthias; Pullmann, Torben; Heimer, Dirk] Albert Ing GmbH, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Stahl, Christoph] Galileo ip Ingenieure GmbH, D-92665 Altenstadt, Germany; [Stollewerk, Axel; Hilgers, Michael; Jansen, Eva; Schoenebeck, Brigitte] Kempen Krause Ingn GmbH, D-52072 Aachen, Germany; [Buchholz, Oliver] Hydrotec Ingenieurgesellschaft Wasser & Umwelt mbH, D-52066 Aachen, Germany; [Papadakis, Ioannis] Dr Papadakis GmbH, D-45276 Essen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of Freiburg; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Germany; Fraunhofer Physical Measurement Techniques; Hamburg University of Technology,"Hartmann, S; Valles, R (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair & Inst Construct Management Digital Engn & R, D-52070 Aachen, Germany.",hartmann@icom.rwth-aachen.de; valles@icom.rwth-aachen.de,"Jaekel, Jan-Iwo/LZE-4882-2025",,Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) [19FS2059A-G]; Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) within the mFUND program,Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV); Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) within the mFUND program,"This research is funded by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) within the mFUND program under grant 19FS2059A-G.

We developed an evaluation measure, the Accrual Index (AI), normalized for sample size and study duration, using data from the protocol and study management databases. We applied the AI retrospectively and prospectively to assess its utility. MethodsAccrual Target, Projected Time to Accrual Completion (PTAC), Evaluable Subjects, Dates of Recruitment Initiation, Analysis, and Completion were defined. AI is (% Accrual Target accrued/% PTAC elapsed). Changes to recruitment practices were described, and data extracted from study management databases. ResultsDecember 2014 (or final) AI was analyzed for 101 studies initiating recruitment from 2007 to 2014. Median AI was 1 for protocols initiating recruitment in 2011, 2013, and 2014. The AI varied widely for studies pre-2013. Studies with AI > 4 utilized convenience samples for recruitment. Data-justified PTAC was refined in 2013-2014 after which the AI range narrowed. Protocol characteristics were not associated with study AI. ConclusionProtocol AI reflects the relative agreement between accrual feasibility assessment (PTAC), and accrual performance, and is affected by recruitment practices. The AI may be useful in managing accountability, modeling accrual, allocating recruitment resources, and testing innovations in recruitment practices.","[Corregano, Lauren; Bastert, Katelyn; Kost, Rhonda G.] Rockefeller Univ, Clin Res Support Off, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, New York, NY 10021 USA; [da Rosa, Joel Correa] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Dept Res Design & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA",Rockefeller University; Rockefeller University,"Kost, RG (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Clin Res Support Off, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",kostr@rockefeller.edu,"Da Rosa, Joel/AAU-1238-2020; Kost, Rhonda/KLZ-8861-2024; Correa da Rosa, Joel/Q-4753-2017","Correa da Rosa, Joel/0000-0003-4221-1976",National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [UL1 TR000043]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program,National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)),"Supported in part by grant # UL1 TR000043 from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program.",,11,6,6,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-8054,1752-8062,,CTS-CLIN TRANSL SCI,CTS-Clin.

Even after successful deployments, data science projects grapple with ethical dilemmas, such as bias and discrimination. Current project management methodologies prioritize efficiency and cost savings over risk management. The methodologies largely overlook the diverse risks of sociotechnical systems and risk articulation inherent in data science lifecycles. Conversely, while the established risk management framework (RMF) by NIST and McKinsey aims to manage AI risks, there is a heavy reliance on normative definitions of risk, neglecting the multifaceted subjectivities of data science project failures. This paper reports on a systematic literature review that identifies three main themes: Big Data Execution Issues, Demand for a Risk Management Framework tailored for Large-Scale Data Science Projects, and the need for a General Risk Management Framework for all Data Science Endeavors. Another overarching focus is on how risk is articulated by the institution and the practitioners. The paper discusses a novel and adaptive data science risk management framework - DS EthiCo RMF - which merges project management, ethics, and risk management for diverse data science projects into one holistic framework. This agile risk management framework DS EthiCo RMF can bridge the current divide between normative risk standards and the multitude of data science requirements, offering a human-centric method to navigate the intertwined sociotechnical risks of failure in data science projects.","[Lahiri, Sucheta; Saltz, Jeff] Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Lahiri, S (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",sulahiri@syr.edu; jsaltz@syr.edu,,,,,,,43,0,0,17,17,SCIKA,CORRELHA,"SCIKA, CORRELHA, 00000, PORTUGAL",2182-7796,2182-7788,,IJISPM-INT J INF SYS,IJISPM-Int.

Healthcare organizations experience significant barriers implementing AI/ML models for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes. In this perspective, we delve into the numerous and diverse quality control measures and responsibilities that emerge when moving from AI/ML-model development in a research environment to deployment in clinical care. The Sleep-Well Baby project, a ML-based monitoring system, currently being tested at the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht, serves as a use-case illustrating our personal learning journey in this field. We argue that, in addition to quality assurance measures taken by the manufacturer, user responsibilities should be embedded in a quality management system (QMS) that is focused on life-cycle management of AI/ML-CDS models in a medical routine care environment. Furthermore, we highlight the strong similarities between AI/ML-CDS models and in vitro diagnostic devices and propose to use ISO15189, the quality guideline for medical laboratories, as inspiration when building a QMS for AI/ML-CDS usage in the clinic. We finally envision a future in which healthcare institutions run or have access to a medical AI-lab that provides the necessary expertise and quality assurance for AI/ML-CDS implementation and applies a QMS that mimics the ISO15189 used in medical laboratories.","[Bartels, Richard; Oberski, Daniel; van't Veen, Annemarie] Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Digital Hlth, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dudink, Jeroen] Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Wilhelmina Childrens Hosp, Dept Neonatol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dudink, Jeroen] Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Brain Ctr Rudolf Magnus, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Haitjema, Saskia] Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Cent Diagnost Lab, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van't Veen, Annemarie] Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Med Microbiol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center,"Bartels, R (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Digital Hlth, Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.t.bartels-6@umcutrecht.nl,,"Bartels, Richard/0000-0001-7214-8029; van t Veen, Annemarie/0000-0002-1088-3658",,,,,26,8,10,6,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2673-253X,,FRONT DIGIT HEALTH,Front.

I shall demonstrate how a specific self-organized learning network that we have newly developed can be applied to problems of project management. This new network SEN will be described and its possibilities are shown by the application to different problems of project management, e.g. the selection of suited collaborators for a specific project, the classification of problematic customers or also the selection of suited procedures for project management in a specific firm. The SEN seems to be a universal instrument for different purposes as many reactions from managers in several large firms have shown.

Although efficacious treatments exist, disease control is often sub-optimal leading to chronic disease-related sequela. Poor disease control can partially be explained by the 'one size fits all' pharmacological approach. Precision medicine aims to tailor treatments to the individual. CURATE.AI is a dosing optimisation platform that considers individual factors to improve the precision of drug therapies. CURATE.AI has been validated in other therapeutic areas, such as cancer, but has yet to be applied in chronic disease care. We will evaluate the CURATE.AI system through a single-arm feasibility study (n = 20 hypertensives and n = 20 type II diabetics). Dosing decisions will be based on CURATE.AI recommendations. We will prospectively collect clinical and qualitative data and report on the clinical effect, implementation challenges, and acceptability of using CURATE.AI. In addition, we will explore how to enhance the algorithm further using retrospective patient data. For example, the inclusion of other variables, the simultaneous optimisation of multiple drugs, and the incorporation of other artificial intelligence algorithms. Overall, this project aims to understand the feasibility of using CURATE.AI in clinical practice. Barriers and enablers to CURATE.AI will be identified to inform the system's future development.","[Mukhopadhyay, Amartya; Sumner, Jennifer; Ling, Lieng Hsi; Teng, Gim Gee] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore 117597, Singapore; [Mukhopadhyay, Amartya; Sumner, Jennifer] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Alexandra Hosp, Med Affairs Res Innovat & Enterprise, Singapore 159964, Singapore; [Mukhopadhyay, Amartya] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Med, Div Resp & Crit Care Med, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Sumner, Jennifer] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York YO10 5DQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Ling, Lieng Hsi] Natl Univ Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Quek, Raphael Hao Chong; Motani, Mehul] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore 117583, Singapore; [Tan, Andre Teck Huat] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Teng, Gim Gee] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Alexandra Hosp, Chron Programme, Singapore 159964, Singapore; [Teng, Gim Gee] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Seetharaman, Santhosh Kumar] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Alexandra Hosp, Hlth Ageing Programme, Singapore 159964, Singapore; [Seetharaman, Santhosh Kumar] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Med, Div Geriatr Med, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Gollamudi, Satya Pavan Kumar] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Alexandra Hosp, FAST Programme, Singapore 159964, Singapore; [Gollamudi, Satya Pavan Kumar] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Med, Div Adv Internal Med, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Ho, Dean] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biomed Engn, Singapore 119077, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; University of York - UK; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Sumner, J (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore 117597, Singapore.;Sumner, J (corresponding author), Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Alexandra Hosp, Med Affairs Res Innovat & Enterprise, Singapore 159964, Singapore.;Sumner, J (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York YO10 5DQ, N Yorkshire, England.",amartya_mukhopadhyay@nuhs.edu.sg; jennifer_sumner@nuhs.edu.sg; lingl@nuhs.edu.sg; e0003601@u.nus.edu; andre_th_tan@nuhs.edu.sg; gee_teng@nuhs.edu.sg; mdcsnks@nus.edu.sg; pk_gollamudi@nuhs.edu.sg; biedh@nus.edu.sg; motani@nus.edu.sg,"Motani, Mehul/B-5944-2011; Sumner, Jennifer/AAT-3319-2021; MUKHOPADHYAY, AMARTYA/AAG-8144-2021","Mukhopadhyay, Amartya/0000-0002-9747-5277; Motani, Mehul/0000-0003-3262-0207; Sumner, Jennifer/0000-0002-2200-3275; SEETHARAMAN, Santhosh Kumar/0000-0003-0012-1673","Health Innovation Programme, National University of Singapore; National University Health System, Singapore [CF/THK/19/13]","Health Innovation Programme, National University of Singapore; National University Health System, Singapore","The research is funded by the Health Innovation Programme, National University of Singapore and the National University Health System, Singapore (CF/THK/19/13).",,41,17,17,5,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Traditionally, researchers self-managed their workflows in a manual and tedious way that heavily relies on their memory. Due to the complexity and unpredictability of AI models, they often struggled to track and manage all the data, steps, and history of the workflow. AI workflows are time-consuming, redundant, and errorprone, especially when big data is involved. A common strategy to make these workflows more manageable is to use a workflow management system, and we recommend Geoweaver, an open-source workflow management system that enables users to create, modify and reuse AI workflows all in one place. To make our work in Geoweaver reusable by the other workflow management systems, we created an add-on functionality geoweaver_cwl, a Python package that automatically converts Geoweaver AI workflows into the Common Workflow Language (CWL) format. It will allow researchers to easily share, exchange, modify, reuse, and build a new workflow from existing ones in other CWL-compliant software. A user study was conducted with the existing workflows created by Geoweaver to collect suggestions and fill in the gaps between our package and Geoweaver. The evaluation confirms that geoweaver_cwl can lead to a well-versed AI process while disclosing opportunities for further extensions.

This study introduces AICD-CDM, a novel framework that integrates several advanced machine learning techniques, Light Gradient Boosting (LGBoost), and Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost), to address the multifaceted challenges of cost prediction and management in sustainable building projects. By leveraging the distinct strengths of these methods, the AICD-CDM model offers a multi-dimensional approach to cost estimation, providing not only point predictions but also probabilistic forecasts to better manage uncertainties inherent in green building projects. The model's capability to process complex, non-linear relationships between a multitude of cost-influencing factors makes it exceptionally adept at handling the intricate dynamics of sustainable construction. Furthermore, the integration of AI techniques ensures enhanced accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency, making the AICD-CDM an invaluable tool for decision-makers in the green building sector. This research not only contributes to the field of construction management by introducing a sophisticated cost control mechanism but also aligns with global sustainability goals by promoting efficient resource allocation and cost optimization in green buildings.

There is hardly any sector that is left untouched by this form of innovation. This is also true for the power sector, which is the industry targeted for this study. The power sector is crucial for human existence, and hence, it is the use of different kinds of technology that must be employed at the helm of its operations. These different kinds of technology are related to AI, Robotics, IoT, and Big Data. The major intention behind these technologies should be to pace up different projects managed in the industry. Therefore, the company selected for this project is Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). It is a company that is involved with various technological projects ranging from smart grids to digital meters to managing customer data. By interviewing thirteen key people from the company, the study highlights the current status of technology and how it is being employed by different power sector companies. In the end, it has been deduced that the future of the power industry relies on its adaption of green energy generation, and hence, all the efforts of the companies should be directed toward producing green energy with the help of modern technology. Also, it was found that the use of AI can enhance the efficiency of the projects, making them less risky. Therefore, the use of AI ensures that the projects are less prone to risks and have a higher chance of success..","[el Khatib, Mounir; al Ali, Shikha; Alharam, Ibrahim; Alhajeri, Ali] Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart Univ, Sch Business & Qual Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Peneva, Gabriela; Angelova, Jordanka; Shanaa, Mahmoud] Tech Univ Sofia, Fac Management, Sofia, Bulgaria",Technical University Sofia,"el Khatib, M (corresponding author), Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart Univ, Sch Business & Qual Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",m.elkhatib@hbmsu.ac.ae; ShikhaS.AlAli@gmail.com; I.alharam@live.com; Alharjri1997@icloud.com; gabriela_peneva@tu-sofia.bg; jsa@tu-sofia.bg; Dr.mahmoud.shanaha@gmail.com,"Peneva, Gabriela/LUW-8308-2024; Angelova, Yordanka/KYP-8695-2024","Angelova, Yordanka/0000-0003-3419-3739",,,,,28,1,1,8,15,NATSIONALNO IZDATELSTVO AZ BUKI,SOFIA,"BUL TSARIGRADSKO SHOSE, 125, BL 5, SOFIA, 1113, BULGARIA",1310-0270,1314-8575,,STRATEG POLICY SCI E,Strateg.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations' AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations' performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company's business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries.","[Wamba-Taguimdje, Serge-Lopez; Tchatchouang Wanko, Chris Emmanuel] Catholic Univ Cent Africa, GRIAGES, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Fosso Wamba, Samuel] Toulouse Business Sch, Dept Informat Operat & Management Sci, Toulouse, France; [Kala Kamdjoug, Jean Robert] Catholic Univ Cent Africa, FSSG GRIAGES, Yaounde, Cameroon",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Wamba, SF (corresponding author), Toulouse Business Sch, Dept Informat Operat & Management Sci, Toulouse, France.",lopezserge501@gmail.com; s.fosso-wamba@tbs-education.fr; jrkala@gmail.com; chrisemmanuelt@gmail.com,"Fosso Wamba, Samuel/AAB-4953-2019","TCHATCHOUANG WANKO, Chris Emmanuel/0000-0001-8016-3579; Fosso Wamba, Samuel/0000-0002-1073-058X; Wamba-Taguimdje, Serge-Lopez/0000-0002-4493-4695",,,,,96,325,342,236,864,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-7154,1758-4116,,BUS PROCESS MANAG J,Bus.

This paper is intended to describe BeGREEN's technical scope and objectives. These objectives aim at improving energy efficiency of the beyond 5G (B5G) networks. BeGREEN technical agenda includes analysis of the combined energy and spectrum efficiency of the B5G networks, based on massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) scenarios. The project proposes a novel architecture that includes several innovative solutions. An offloading engine is used for hardware acceleration that is a solution for compute-heavy physical layer processing in 5G new radio (5G NR) mMIMO and beyond to improve the processing performance and energy efficiency. The architecture also includes joint communication and sensing (JCAS) for improving energy efficiency of the physical layer functions by, e.g., efficient beam-search and beam tracking, and uses reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as an enabler for JCAS. BeGREEN proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted energy-aware Intelligent Plane as an additional plane along with user plane and data plane, that allows the data, model, and inference to be seamlessly exchanged between network functions. The project also proposes an AI Engine that is consist of an execution environment that can host AI models and will manage their lifecycle and access to data.","[Ghoraishi, Mir] Gigasys Solut Ltd, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oriol Sallent, Jose] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain; [Catalan-Cid, Miguel] i2CAT Fdn, Barcelona, Spain; [Bielsa, Guillermo; Esteban-Rivas, Juan-Francisco] Telefonica, RAN Innovat Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Sark, Vladica; Teran, Jesus Gutierrez] IHP GmbH, Innovat High Performance Microelect, Frankfurt, Germany; [Pryor, Simon] Accelleran, Antwerp, Belgium",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Internet I Innovacio Digital A Catalunya (I2CAT); Telefonica SA; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Innovative Mikroelektronik (IHP),"Ghoraishi, M (corresponding author), Gigasys Solut Ltd, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",mir@gigasys.co.uk; jose.oriol.sallent@upc.edu; miguel.catalan@i2cat.net; guillermo.bielsa@telefonica.com; juanfrancisco.estebanrivas@telefonica.com; sark@ihp-microelectronics.com; teran@ihp-microelectronics.com; simon.pryor@accelleran.com,"Catalan Cid, Miguel/JXM-5368-2024","Catalan-Cid, Miguel/0000-0001-5171-7771","European Commission's Horizon Europe, Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking, research and innovation program [101097083]; Horizon Europe - Pillar II [101097083] Funding Source: Horizon Europe - Pillar II","European Commission's Horizon Europe, Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking, research and innovation program; Horizon Europe - Pillar II(European Union (EU)Horizon Europe - Pillar II)","This work is supported by the European Commission's Horizon Europe, Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking, research and innovation program under grant agreement #101097083, BeGREEN project.",,10,1,1,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2475-6490,2575-4912,979-8-3503-1102-0,EUR CONF NETW COMMUN,,,2023,,,,,,,717,722,,10.1109/EUCNC/6GSUMMIT58263.2023.10188307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EUCNC/6GSUMMIT58263.2023.10188307,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BV4QR,,Green Published,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001039230700122,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study assessed the health factors as the outcome of pre- and post-health screening and health management through AIIoT-OAHPs for six months.Results Preand post-health screening and management through AIIoT-OAHPs were evaluated as significant outcomes in 14 health factors. Notably, the benefits of post-cognitive function showed a twofold increase in older female adults through AIIoT-OAHPs. Adults over 70 showed a fourfold increase in post-walking days, a threefold in post-dietary practice, and a twofold in post-cognitive function in the post-effects compared with pre via AIIoT-OAHPs.Conclusions AIIoT-OAHPs seem to be an effective program in the realm of face-to-face and non-face-to-face AIIoT-based older adults' healthcare initiatives in the era of COVID-19. Consequently, the study suggests that AIIoT-OAHPs contribute to the upgrade in health promotion of older adults. In future studies, the effectiveness of AIIoT-OAHPs can be evaluated as a continuous project every year in the short term and every two years in the long term.","[Kim, Jong In] Wonkwang Univ, Fac Hlth & Welf, Korean Soc Hlth & Welf, Iksan, South Korea; [Kim, Gukbin] UCL, Global Management Nat Resources, London, England",Wonkwang University; University of London; University College London,"Kim, JI (corresponding author), Wonkwang Univ, Fac Hlth & Welf, Korean Soc Hlth & Welf, Iksan, South Korea.",kji122@wku.ac.kr,"Kim, Jong/AAD-5621-2019","Kim, Jong In/0000-0002-8960-485X",Basic Science Research Programme through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2022R1I1A1A01069140],"Basic Science Research Programme through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea)","The authors received the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported Basic Science Research Programme through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education (2022R1I1A1A01069140).",,74,1,1,8,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2055-2076,,,DIGIT HEALTH,Digit.

It originated from the desire to understand the potential of true robotic surgery, as existing robotic systems are tele-manipulators rather than autonomous robots. AI's role in surgery involves levels of autonomy and a balance between human expertise and technological advancements. In this regard, a new field of Surgiomics emerges, integrating patient data such as genomics, radiomics, and pathomics to enhance surgical decision- making. Overcoming limitations in surgical data analysis, AI processes vast amounts of data, detects subtle patterns, and explores complex relationships. As Surgiomics continues to evolve, it holds the potential to reshape surgical patient management. Initiatives like the Artificial intelligence, Radiomics, Genomics, Oncopathomics and Surgomics (AiRGOS) Project aim to develop AI algorithms for precision therapeutic treatments in cancer patients using radiologic imaging, genomic sequencing, and clinical data. In this commentary, we envision a future where AI technologies revolutionize surgical decision-making and create personalized treatment plans based on comprehensive patient data.","[Gumbs, Andrew A.] Amer Hosp Tblisi, Dept Surg, 17 Ushangi Chkheidze St, Tblisi 0102, Georgia; [Croner, Roland] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Gen Visceral Vasc & Transplantat Surg, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Abu-Hilal, Mohammed; Bannone, Elisa] Fdn Poliambulanza Ist Osped, Reparto Chirurg, Unita Chirurg Epatobiliopancreat Robot & Mininvas, I-25124 Brescia, Italy; [Ishizawa, Takeaki] Osaka Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg, Osaka 5458585, Japan; [Spolverato, Gaya] Univ Padua, Dept Surg Oncol & Gastroenterol Sci, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Frigerio, Isabella] Pederzoli Hosp, Dept Hepatopancreatobiliary Surg, I-37019 Peschiera, Italy; [Siriwardena, Ajith] Manchester Royal Infirm, Reg Hepatopancreatobiliary Unit, Manchester M13 9WL, England; [Messaoudi, Nouredin] Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, Univ Ziekenhuis Brussel UZ Brussel, Dept Surg, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Messaoudi, Nouredin] Europe Hosp, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium",Otto von Guericke University; Osaka Metropolitan University; University of Padua; University of Manchester; University Hospital Brussels; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Gumbs, AA (corresponding author), Amer Hosp Tblisi, Dept Surg, 17 Ushangi Chkheidze St, Tblisi 0102, Georgia.",aagumbs@gmail.com,"Spolverato, Gaya/M-1965-2017; Messaoudi, Nouredin/KHW-7611-2024; BANNONE, ELISA/ABF-3638-2021; ISABELLA, FRIGERIO/ISB-9310-2023","Messaoudi, Nouredin/0000-0003-2799-2604; Gumbs, ANDREW/0000-0002-7044-5318",,,"The authors would like to thank Stephen Song for his technical support in the conceptualization of this manuscript.

However, decision-making often favours specific NBS designs, leading to uneven benefits distribution. Whereas human-centric NBS design relies on convenience, financial sustainability, historical aspects, and amenity increase through NBS technical solutions, flora- and fauna-centric (or eco-centric) design targets spatial connectedness of blue-green spaces, increase in species richness, and habitat within urban centres. Both approaches can shape the urban biodiversity landscape, yet; they often clash around planning priorities. Recent advances in AI offer potential for AI-centric urban planning, though its role remains unclear. This study examines the interplay between biodiversity and NBS planning across human-, eco-, and AI-centric domains, aiming for balanced urban outcomes. We blended narrative, integrative, and systematic literature review and propose future steps for more balanced NBS development. The findings of this work suggest that AI presents an opportunity for a more balanced NBS design through its applications in climate change prediction, water management, and project visualisation. Incorporating AI into urban planning tools can expedite modelling process, improve stakeholder communication, and enhance project outcomes visualisation. By integrating human, eco, and AI-centric approaches, urban planners can foster resilience and sustainability in NBS implementation, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across urban landscapes.","[Prodanovic, Veljko; Stojkovic, Milan] Inst Artificial Intelligence Res & Dev Serbia, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Prodanovic, Veljko] Univ Belgrade, Inst Multidisciplinary Res, Kneza Viseslava 1, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Prodanovic, Veljko] UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Bach, Peter M.] Eastern Switzerland Univ Appl Sci OST, Inst Environm & Proc Engn UMTEC, Oberseestr 10, CH-8640 Rapperswil, SG, Switzerland; [Bach, Peter M.] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Belgrade; University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University,"Prodanovic, V (corresponding author), Inst Artificial Intelligence Res & Dev Serbia, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.;Prodanovic, V (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Inst Multidisciplinary Res, Kneza Viseslava 1, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.;Prodanovic, V (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",prodanovic.veljko@gmail.com,"Bach, Peter/I-4618-2019; Prodanovic, Veljko/W-4092-2019; Stojkovic, Milan/MCK-4022-2025","Prodanovic, Veljko/0000-0002-3800-0765",University of New South Wales,University of New South Wales,No Statement Available,,81,5,5,42,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,OCT,2024,27,5,,,,,1795,1806,,10.1007/s11252-024-01558-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-024-01558-6,,MAY 2024,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,G4T9W,,hybrid,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001223440700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has led to variability in dosing recommendations resulting in confusion among endocrine, non-endocrine providers and patient families. This quality improvement project sought to standardize documentation and hydrocortisone stress dosing within our pediatric endocrine division to optimize communication regarding AI management.Methods Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle one aimed to address documentation of components important in AI management including body surface area (BSA), home daily dose, home stress dose, in-patient stress dose, procedure dose and crisis dose using a smart phrase within the electronic health record (EHR). To automate the process, PDSA cycle two introduced two smart buttons within the endocrine notes. PDSA cycle three focused on standardizing hydrocortisone stress doses.Results Initial documentation targets were met for all AI management components except for the crisis dose. The second target was only met for the home stress dose. Implementing the smart buttons aided in reaching the second target for home daily and home stress doses. Dose standardization targets were achieved in all categories except for the on-going crisis dose. A follow up survey after an in-service for non-endocrine providers showed increased knowledge of locating hydrocortisone stress dosing recommendations within the EHR.Conclusions With the assistance of technology, this quality improvement project ultimately enhanced communication through the standardization of documentation and individualized hydrocortisone stress dosing for children with AI. Although not all secondary targets were met, there was meaningful improvement in documentation and stress dose standardization compliance.","[Chakravarthy, Varshini] Phoenix Childrens, Pediat Endocrinol & Diabet, 1920 E Cambridge Ave Suite 301, Phoenix, AZ 85006 USA; [Barger, Katie; Gonsalves, Rob; Shaibi, Gabriel Q.; Kapadia, Chirag; Newbern, Dorothee] Phoenix Childrens, Pediat Endocrinol & Diabet, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Vaidya, Vinay] Phoenix Childrens, Dept Informat Technol, Phoenix, AZ USA",,"Chakravarthy, V (corresponding author), Phoenix Childrens, Pediat Endocrinol & Diabet, 1920 E Cambridge Ave Suite 301, Phoenix, AZ 85006 USA.",varshini.chakravarthy@gmail.com,,,We would like to thank Dr. Wendy Arafiles for adding the Complex Care Button and for her work on helping us improve patient care for our patients with AI.

A qualitative research,JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; AI implementation; AI success factors; Human-machine trust; Trust paradoxes,MANAGEMENT,"PurposeExploring trust's impact on AI project success. Companies can't leverage AI without employee trust. While analytics features like speed and precision can build trust, they may also lower it during implementation, leading to paradoxes. This study identifies these paradoxes and proposes strategies to manage them.Design/methodology/approachThis paper applies a grounded theory approach based on 35 interviews with senior managers, users, and implementers of analytics solutions of large European companies.FindingsIt identifies seven paradoxes, namely, knowledge substitution, task substitution, domain expert, time, error, reference, and experience paradoxes and provides some real-life examples of managing them.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitations of this paper include its focus on machine learning projects from the last two years, potentially overlooking longer-term trends. The study's micro-level perspective on implementation projects may limit broader insights, and the research primarily examines European contexts, potentially missing out on global perspectives. Additionally, the qualitative methodology used may limit the generalizability of findings. Finally, while the paper identifies trust paradoxes, it does not offer an exhaustive exploration of their dynamics or quantitative measurements of their strength.Practical implicationsSeveral tactics to tackle trust paradoxes in AI projects have been identified, including a change roadmap, data load tests, early expert involvement, model descriptions, piloting, plans for machine-human cooperation, learning time, and a backup system. Applying these can boost trust in AI, giving organizations an analytical edge.Social implicationsThe AI-driven digital transformation is inevitable; the only question is whether we will lead, participate, or fall behind. This paper explores how organizations can adapt to technological changes and how employees can leverage AI to enhance efficiency with minimal disruption.Originality/valueThis paper offers a theoretical overview of trust in analytics and analyses over 30 interviews from real-life analytics projects, contributing to a field typically dominated by statistical or anecdotal evidence. It provides practical insights with scientific rigour derived from the interviews and the author's nearly decade-long consulting career.","[Bakonyi, Zoltan] Boston Consulting Grp Inc, Budapest, Hungary",Boston Consulting Group (BCG),"Bakonyi, Z (corresponding author), Boston Consulting Grp Inc, Budapest, Hungary.",zoltan.bakonyi.phd@gmail.com,"Bakonyi, Zoltán/HLG-5836-2023","Bakonyi, Zoltan/0000-0002-3141-6821",,,"I would like to express my gratitude to all interviewees for their invaluable insights.

This paper presents results from the first phase of a multicenter project aimed at developing an AI-supported system to predict aftercare needs and improve DM processes in German hospitals. We conducted an exploratory needs analysis using participatory methods (workshops, questionnaires and interviews) and defined suitable use cases. We observed a high level of interest in the proposed AI-supported system.

However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games,first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their controllers.","[Yoon, Du-Mim; Kim, Kyung-Joong] Sejong Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 143747, South Korea",Sejong University,"Kim, KJ (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 143747, South Korea.",kimkj@sejong.ac.kr,,"Kim, Kyung Joong/0000-0002-7732-0817",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [2013 R1A2A2A01016589],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (2013 R1A2A2A01016589).,,27,21,22,10,99,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2015,3,,,,,,793,804,,10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2442680,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2442680,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,DF5JP,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000371388200060,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Industry 4.0, complex data are produced in high volume, which makes implementing improvement projects with traditional methods lose their effectiveness. Six Sigma is one of the most prominent improvement methods organizations and companies use to identify and solve problems. Therefore, for implementing Six Sigma projects in Industry 4.0, the need to develop the traditional Six Sigma toolbox is felt. AI and Blockchain can be suitable tools for developing and improving Six Sigma for Industry 4.0. A systematic review identified 58 articles in this article that presented solutions for integrating AI or Blockchain in Six Sigma. Some articles have evaluated the performance of their proposed method by implementing the proposed models. The most widely used machine learning and deep learning algorithms in Six Sigma have been identified. Also, Six Sigma approaches that mostly use AI or Blockchain have been identified by the analysis of articles. Decision tree algorithms and artificial neural networks are used in most Six Sigma define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) projects. Therefore, by reviewing the articles, it was found that AI and Blockchain are mainly used as efficient tools in DMAIC and the Design for Six Sigma models to implement Six Sigma projects. In this article, 28 main gaps are presented as future works for future research.","[Najafi, Behzad; Farahmandian, Arshad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Management, Zanjan 4515658145, Iran; [Najafi, Amir] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Zanjan 4515658145, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Najafi, A (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Zanjan 4515658145, Iran.",bzh1370@gmail.com; anajafi@aut.ac.ir; afarahmandian110@gmail.com,"najafi, behzad/GOK-1636-2022","najafi, behzad/0000-0001-9730-6089; farahmandian, arshad/0000-0002-2559-834X",,,,,221,3,3,26,43,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

However, a majority of the AI studies in the energy domain have been focusing on solving specific technical issues. There is limited discussion on how AI can be utilized to enhance the energy system operations, particularly the electricity market, with a holistic view. The purpose of the study is to introduce the platform architectural logic that encompasses both technical and economic perspectives to the development of AI-enabled energy platforms for the future electricity market with massive and distributed renewables. A constructive and inductive approach for theory building is employed for the concept proposition of the AI energy platform by using the aggregated data from a European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 project and a Finnish national innovation project. Our results are presented as a systemic framework and high-level representation of the AI-enabled energy platform design with four integrative layers that could enable not only value provisioning but also value utilization for a distributed energy system and electricity market as the new knowledge and contribution to the extant research. Finally, the study discusses the potential use cases of the AI-enabled energy platform.","[Xu, Yueqiang; Ahokangas, Petri] Univ Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Louis, Jean-Nicolas; Pongracz, Eva] Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Water Energy & Environm Engn Res Unit, Oulu 90014, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Oulu,"Xu, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, Oulu 90014, Finland.",yueqiang.xu@oulu.fi; petri.ahokangas@oulu.fi; jean-nicolas.louis@oulu.fi; eva.pongracz@oulu.fi,"Ahokangas, Petri/AAH-9632-2021; Louis, Jean-Nicolas/N-6200-2014; Pongracz, Eva/L-2054-2013","Louis, Jean-Nicolas/0000-0002-7917-9634; Pongracz, Eva/0000-0002-2216-8328; Ahokangas, Petri/0000-0002-2351-8473","Business Finland (Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development); Academy of Finland, SEN2050 project (Smart energy networks 2050) [287748]; VirpaD project","Business Finland (Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development); Academy of Finland, SEN2050 project (Smart energy networks 2050)(Research Council of Finland); VirpaD project","This research is funded by Business Finland (the Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development), the VirpaD project and Academy of Finland, SEN2050 project (Smart energy networks 2050, funding number: 287748).",,98,31,32,7,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2019,12,21,,,,,,,4128,10.3390/en12214128,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12214128,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,KJ8XS,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000512340000107,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geospatial datasets are multi-dimensional; have spatiotemporal context; exist in disparate formats; and require sophisticated AI workflows that include not only the AI algorithm training and testing, but also data preprocessing and result post-processing. This complexity poses a huge challenge when it comes to full-stack AI workflow management, as researchers often use an assortment of time-intensive manual operations to manage their projects. However, none of the existing workflow management software provides a satisfying solution on hybrid resources, full file access, data flow, code control, and provenance. This paper introduces a new system named Geoweaver to improve the e fficiency of full-stack AI workflow management. It supports linking all the preprocessing, AI training and testing, and post-processing steps into a single automated workflow. To demonstrate its utility, we present a use case in which Geoweaver manages end-to-end deep learning for in-time crop mapping using Landsat data. We show how Geoweaver effectively removes the tedium of managing various scripts, code, libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, servers, and platforms, greatly reducing the time, cost, and effort researchers must spend on such AI-based workflows. The concepts demonstrated through Geoweaver serve as an important building block in the future of cyberinfrastructure for AI research.","[Sun, Ziheng; Di, Liping] George Mason Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Syst, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Burgess, Annie] ESIP, Raleigh, NC 27612 USA; [Tullis, Jason A.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Tullis, Jason A.] Univ Arkansas, Ctr Adv Spatial Technol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Magill, Andrew B.] Univ Texas Austin, Texas Adv Comp Ctr, Austin, TX 78712 USA",George Mason University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Di, LP (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Syst, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",zsun@gmu.edu; ldi@gmu.edu; annieburgess@esipfed.org; jatullis@uark.edu; amagill@tacc.utexas.edu,,"Sun, Ziheng/0000-0001-9810-0023; Magill, Andrew/0000-0003-0084-9090; Bryant Burgess, Ann/0000-0002-6026-0336","ESIP Lab; National Science Foundation [1740693, 1739705]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1739705] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1740693] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",ESIP Lab; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Directorate For Geosciences; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This research was funded by ESIP Lab and National Science Foundation, grant number AGS#1740693 and CNS#1739705.",,112,18,20,1,52,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

To this end, it conducts a multiple case study with semi-structured interviews in six companies, totalling 17 implementation cases. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model guided the entire study and the analysis of the results by targeting specific processes. The results highlighted how AI methods in OSCM can increase the companies' competitiveness by reducing costs and lead times and improving service levels, quality, safety, and sustainability. However, they also identify barriers in the implementation of AI, such as ensuring data quality, lack of specific skills, need for high investments, lack of clarity on economic benefits and lack of experience in cost analysis for AI projects.

The second is the deployment of a highly performant, scalable, cloud-based data management and AI platform designed for time series data to enable the easy storage, processing and analysis of grid sensor data. The third is the cultivation of an open research community of experts around the platform and data through useful educational material, code and data sharing, and data science competitions.

Specifically, we consider how AI-generated research and text could both assist and augment the publication process, as well as harm it. Consequentially, our policy acknowledges the need for careful oversight regarding the use of AI to assist in the authoring of texts and in data analyses, while also noting the importance of requiring authors to be transparent about how, when and where they have utilized AI in their submissions or underlying research. Additionally, we examine how and in what ways AI's use may be antithetical to the spirit of a quality journal like JMS that values both human voice and research transparency. Our editorial explains why we require author teams to oversee all aspects of AI use within their projects, and to take personal responsibility for accuracy in all aspects of their research. We also explain our prohibition of AI's use in peer-reviewers' evaluations of submissions, and regarding editors' handling of manuscripts.","[Gatrell, Caroline] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, England; [Muzio, Daniel] Univ York, York, England; [Post, Corinne] Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA USA; [Wickert, Christopher] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wickert, Christopher] Vrile Univ Amsterdam VU, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management & Org, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Liverpool; University of York - UK; Villanova University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Wickert, C (corresponding author), Vrile Univ Amsterdam VU, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management & Org, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",christopher.wickert@vu.nl,"Post, Corinne/AAZ-2953-2021","Post, Corinne/0000-0002-6842-602X; Wickert, Christopher/0000-0002-4317-9499",,,,,36,17,17,86,167,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2380,1467-6486,,J MANAGE STUD,J.

Using a mixed-methods approach, including interviews with seven managers from a benchmarked company in the forklift industry (BCFI) and quantitative analysis of operational data, we examine the transformative effects of AI integration. Key findings include a 30% reduction in inventory holding costs due to AI-powered predictive analytics; a 15% decrease in procurement costs through AI-driven supplier evaluation systems; a 25% increase in operational efficiency from AI-optimized route planning; a 40% boost in overall productivity attributed to AI-enabled automation; and a projected 20% reduction in low-skilled labor requirements over the next five years. The study employs environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), balanced scorecard (BSC), benchmarking, and activity-based management (ABM) models to analyze risks and implications of AI integration. A case study of a leading Romanian SME in the forklift industry is presented, examining financial strategies using McKinsey's 7S framework.

India shares 7% of global forest cover and is the 8th most biodiverse region in the world. However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country's rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India. We hope that this synthesis will motivate forest officials, scientists, and conservationists in India to explore AI technology for biodiversity conservation and forest management.","[Shivaprakash, Kadukothanahally Nagaraju; Mysorekar, Sagar; Arora, Roshni; Gangadharan, Aditya; Vohra, Karishma] Nat Conservancy Ctr, 37 Link Rd Lajpatnagar 3, New Delhi 110024, India; [Swami, Niraj] Nature Conservancy, Arington, VA 22201 USA; [Jadeyegowda, Madegowda] Keladi Shivappa Nayaka Univ Agr & Hort Sci, Coll Forestry, Ponnampet 571216, India; [Kiesecker, Joseph M.] Nature Conservancy, Global Lands Program, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",Nature Conservancy; Nature Conservancy,"Shivaprakash, KN (corresponding author), Nat Conservancy Ctr, 37 Link Rd Lajpatnagar 3, New Delhi 110024, India.",shivaprakash.kn@tnc.org; niraj.swami@tnc.org; sagarmysorekar@hotmail.com; roshni.arora@tnc.org; a.gangadharan@tnc.org; karishma.vohra90@gmail.com; mjadegowda@gmail.com; jkiesecker@tnc.org,"Swami, Niraj/GPW-8584-2022; Nagaraju, Shivaprakash/O-7654-2014","Nagaraju, Shivaprakash/0000-0002-5135-8737",,,,,191,34,40,26,118,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,14,12,,,,,,,7154,10.3390/su14127154,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127154,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2L2CG,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000816827300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning, internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin. Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain, aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.","[Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; zlm@hust.edu.cn,"Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024; Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201171, 72271101]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2022YFC3802205]; Shanghai Sailing Program, China [22YF1419100]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Shanghai Sailing Program, China","The work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72201171, 72271101), National Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2022YFC3802205), and Shanghai Sailing Program, China (No. 22YF1419100).",,130,132,132,206,656,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1134-3060,1886-1784,,ARCH COMPUT METHOD E,Arch.

However, to date, efforts are fragmented, based on single-institution, size-limited, and annotation-limited datasets. Available public datasets (e.g., The Cancer Imaging Archive, TCIA, USA) are limited in scope, making model generalizability really difficult. In this direction, five European Union projects are currently working on the development of big data infrastructures that will enable European, ethically and General Data Protection Regulation-compliant, quality-controlled, cancer-related, medical imaging platforms, in which both large-scale data and AI algorithms will coexist.

We used Kamrowska-Zaluska's approach for evaluating AI-based solutions' potential in urban planning. We narrowed down the research to the educational and economic aspects of smart cities. Furthermore, we used a systematic literature review. We propose solutions supporting the implementation process of net zero policies benefiting from single actions of urban dwellers based on the Greencoin project developed by us. By following smart city sectors, the paper introduces AI-based solutions which can enrich Greencoin by addressing the following needs: (1) shaping pro-environmental behaviors, (2) introducing instruments to reinforce the urban management process, (3) supporting bottom-up initiatives allowing to shape urban resilience, (4) enhancing smart mobility, (5) shaping local economies supporting urban circularity, and (6) allowing better communication with residents. Our research fills the gap in the limited group of studies focused on shaping climate awareness, enhancing smart governance, and supporting social participation and inclusion. It proves that AI-based educational tools can be supportive when implementing adaptation policies toward climate neutrality based on our proposed AI-based model shaping climate awareness.","[Obracht-Prondzynska, Hanna] Univ Gdansk, Dept Spatial Management, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland; [Duda, Ewa] Maria Grzegorzewska Univ, Inst Educ, PL-02353 Warsaw, Poland; [Anacka, Helena] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Kowal, Jolanta] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; The Maria Grzegorzewska University; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; University of Wroclaw,"Obracht-Prondzynska, H (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Spatial Management, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland.;Duda, E (corresponding author), Maria Grzegorzewska Univ, Inst Educ, PL-02353 Warsaw, Poland.",hanna.obracht-prondzynska@ug.edu.pl; eduda@aps.edu.pl,"Duda, Ewa/GPC-5301-2022; Kowal, Jolanta/T-5191-2019; Obracht-Prondzynska, Hanna/O-4740-2016; Kowal, Jolanta/N-6343-2015","Duda, Ewa/0000-0003-4535-6388; Obracht-Prondzynska, Hanna/0000-0003-0621-1020; Kowal, Jolanta/0000-0002-6241-9603","EEA Funds [NOR/IdeaLab/GC/0003/202000]; University of Gdansk, Institute of SocioEconomic Geography and Spatial Management","EEA Funds; University of Gdansk, Institute of SocioEconomic Geography and Spatial Management","This research was funded by Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway under the EEA Funds operated by National Centre for Research and Development, grant number NOR/IdeaLab/GC/0003/202000 while the APC was funded from statutory funds of University of Gdansk, Institute of SocioEconomic Geography and Spatial Management.",,103,5,5,18,61,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In addition, it investigates the correlation between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and AI in HRM processes. A survey was conducted with a sample of 310 firm members in the HR Section Romande, as well as a literature review on the adoption of new technologies. The results indicate a perceived positive value of introducing AI in HRM and a correlation between the level of a company's EO and the introduction of AI in HRM. This means that the more a company is entrepreneurially oriented, the more it tends to implement or include already implemented AI projects and tools in HRM processes. The perceived value of AI in HRM was evaluated by comparing answers to research questions involving the introduction of AI in HRM tools, and expectations of widely implementing AI in the next five years. The main barrier of adopting AI in HRM appeared to be a lack of skills and training. In addition, potential features of implementing AI in HRM were identified as potential steps toward introducing AI as a new technology. Questions regarding the evaluation of EO were based on a research Colvin Slevin (1989). It is important for SMEs to invest in information technology to set the basis for further development. Owing to intensified competitive pressures and the necessity of entering global markets, SMEs are incrementally employing Information Technology (IT) to create substantial benefits. Most prior research has focused more on IT adoption in large organizations, yet when regarding the limited resources of SMEs, the IT adoption process is considerably different.

For this reason, the ONAP platform has several different sub projects and APIs each performing a specific function to achieve Network Management. There is some complexity associated with using these APIs and knowing and understanding the many parameters associated with them, which impedes adoption. This not only prevents an end-to-end cloud service orchestration like experience for network services, but also increases the time and money spent on network orchestration. This paper proposes and discusses the design of a conversational AI solution that can interface with some significant APIs in ONAP to solve these problems.

An AI-powered engine examines sensor data recording physical parameters during production (like gas flow, temperature, voltage, etc.) as well as test data, with different goals: (1) the identification of anomalies in the production chain, either offline from collected data-traces or online from a continuous stream of sensed data; (2) the forecasting of new data of the future production; and (3) the automatic generation of synthetic traces, to strengthen the data-based algorithms. All such tasks provide valuable information to an advanced Manufacturing Execution System (MES), which reacts by optimizing the production process and management of the equipment maintenance policies.

AI is gradually going to be used to perform tasks, including identity checks, border security and control, and analysis of data about visa and asylum applicants. To an extent, this is already a reality in some countries such as Canada, which uses algorithmic decision-making in immigration and asylum determination, and Germany, which has piloted projects using technologies such as face and dialect recognition for decision-making in asylum determination processes. The article's central hypothesis is that AI technology can affect international migration management in three different dimensions: (1) by deepening the existing asymmetries between states on the international plane; (2) by modernising states' and international organisations' traditional practices; and (3) by reinforcing the contemporary calls for more evidence-based migration management and border security. The article examines each of these three hypotheses and reflects on the main challenges of using AI solutions for international migration management. It draws on legal, political and technology-facing academic literature, examining the current trends in technological developments and investigating the consequences that these can have for international migration. Most particularly, the article contributes to the current debate about the future of international migration management, informing policymakers in this area of growing importance and fast development.","[Beduschi, Ana] Univ Exeter, Law Sch, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Beduschi, A (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Law Sch, Exeter, Devon, England.",a.beduschi@exeter.ac.uk,,"Beduschi, Ana/0000-0002-8037-5384",,,,,108,52,53,6,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2049-5838,2049-5846,,MIGR STUD,Migr.

Digitalization may offer options to overcome these shortages by providing structured, relevant information and decision support tools for medical professionals. We present the SURGE-Ahead project (Supporting SURgery with GEriatric co-management and Artificial Intelligence) addressing this challenge.MethodsA digital application with a dashboard-style user interface will be developed, displaying 1) evidence-based recommendations for geriatric co-management and 2) artificial intelligence-enhanced suggestions for continuity of care (COC) decisions. The development and implementation of the SURGE-Ahead application (SAA) will follow the Medical research council framework for complex medical interventions. In the development phase a minimum geriatric data set (MGDS) will be defined that combines parametrized information from the hospital information system with a concise assessment battery and sensor data. Two literature reviews will be conducted to create an evidence base for co-management and COC suggestions that will be used to display guideline-compliant recommendations. Principles of machine learning will be used for further data processing and COC proposals for the postoperative course. In an observational and AI-development study, data will be collected in three surgical departments of a University Hospital (trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, urology) for AI-training, feasibility testing of the MGDS and identification of co-management needs. Usability will be tested in a workshop with potential users. During a subsequent project phase, the SAA will be tested and evaluated in clinical routine, allowing its further improvement through an iterative process.DiscussionThe outline offers insights into a novel and comprehensive project that combines geriatric co-management with digital support tools to improve inpatient surgical care and continuity of care of older adults.","[Leinert, Christoph; Fotteler, Marina; Kocar, Thomas Derya; Dallmeier, Dhayana A.; Denkinger, Michael] Ulm Univ, Inst Geriatr Res AGAPLES Bethesda Ulm, Med Ctr, Ulm, Germany; [Leinert, Christoph; Fotteler, Marina; Kocar, Thomas Derya; Dallmeier, Dhayana A.; Denkinger, Michael] Geriatr Ctr Ulm, Ulm, Germany; [Fotteler, Marina; Schobel, Johannes; Swoboda, Walter] Neu Ulm Univ Appl Sci, DigiHealth Inst, Neu Ulm, Germany; [Dallmeier, Dhayana A.] Boston Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Kestler, Hans; Wolf, Dennis] Ulm Univ, Inst Med Syst Biol, Ulm, Germany; [Gebhard, Florian; Uihlein, Adriane] Ulm Univ, Dept Orthoped Trauma, Med Ctr, Ulm, Germany; [Steger, Florian] Ulm Univ, Inst Hist, Philosophy & Ethics Med, Ulm, Germany; [Kilian, Reinhold S.; Mueller-Stierlin, Annabel W.] Ulm Univ, Dept Psychiat & Psychiat 2, Hlth Serv Res, Sect Hlth Econ, Gunzburg, Germany; [Mueller-Stierlin, Annabel W.] Ulm Univ, Inst Epidemiol & Med Biometry, Ulm, Germany; [Michalski, Christoph; Mihaljevic, Andre] Ulm Univ Hosp, Dept Gen & Visceral Surg, Ulm, Germany; [Bolenz, Christian; Zengerling, Friedemann] Ulm Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, Ulm, Germany; [Leinert, Elena; Schuetze, Sabine K.] Ulm Univ Hosp, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Ulm, Germany; [Hoffmann, Thomas] Ulm Univ Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Ulm, Germany; [Onder, Graziano] Inst Super San, Dept Cardiovasc Endocrine Metab Dis & Aging, Rome, Italy; [Andersen-Ranberg, Karen] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth, Dept Clin Res, Geriatr Res Unit, Odense, Denmark; [O'Neill, Desmond] Trinity Coll Dublin, Ctr Ageing, Neurosci & Humanities, Dublin, Ireland; [Wehling, Martin] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med Mannheim, Working Grp FORTA, Mannheim, Germany",Ulm University; Boston University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; University of Southern Denmark; Trinity College Dublin; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Leinert, C (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Geriatr Res AGAPLES Bethesda Ulm, Med Ctr, Ulm, Germany.;Leinert, C (corresponding author), Geriatr Ctr Ulm, Ulm, Germany.",christoph.leinert@uni-ulm.de,"Schobel, Johannes/AAK-4758-2021; Mueller-Stierlin, Annabel/AAC-1241-2022; Wolf, Dennis/S-9217-2018; Dallmeier, Dhayana/A-1169-2015; Hoffmann, Thomas/HPE-6581-2023; Andersen-Ranberg, Karen/P-7053-2015; Denkinger, Michael/E-1814-2013; O'Neill, Desmond/D-1486-2013","Wolf, Dennis/0000-0002-7270-589X; Andersen-Ranberg, Karen/0000-0003-1970-7076; Denkinger, Michael/0000-0002-8097-060X; O'Neill, Desmond/0000-0002-5542-9897; Leinert, Christoph/0000-0001-6638-1780",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GY2101],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The SURGE-Ahead Study Group comprises Anna Ajlani, Karen Andersen-Ranberg, Sophia Andres, Christian Bolenz, Raffael Cintean, Dhayana Dallmeier, Miriam Deniz, Michael Denkinger (Principal Investigator), Colette Dorr-Harim, Anna Lena Flagmeier, Marina Fotteler, Florian Gebhard, Janina Hahn, Daniel Hieber, Thomas Hoffmann, Wolfgang Janni, Hans Kestler, Reinhold Kilian, Thomas Kocar, Christoph Leinert, Elena Leinert, Fabia Mangold, Jorg Meerpohl, Christoph Michalski, Andre Mihaljevic, Annabel Muller-Stierlin, Nadir Nasir, Graziano Onder, Desmond O'Neill, Marcin Orzechowski, Carlos Pankratz, Johannes Schobel, Fabienne Schochter, Konrad Schutze, Sabine Schutze, Tobias Skuban-Eiseler, Vytautas Stasiunaitis, Florian Steger, Walter Swoboda, Adriane Uihlein, Sebastian Voigt-Radloff, Martin Wehling, Pascal Wendel, Felix Wezel, Dennis Wolf, Friedemann Zengerling, and Marco Zeptner.",,77,7,7,2,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 16,2023,18,6,,,,,,,e0287230,10.1371/journal.pone.0287230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,M4IP6,37327245,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001029859700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

We argue that human and AI-based algorithmic decision-making can be usefully ensembled even when neither has a clear advantage over the other in terms of predictive accuracy, and even if neither alone can attain satisfactory accuracy in absolute terms. Many managerial decisions have these attributes, and collaboration between humans and AI is usually ruled out in such contexts because the conditions for specialization are not met.

Condition assessment reports provide essential information decision makers use in asset management. Unfortunately, current methods are limited by human operators being required to watch every second of an inspection video in real-time, which contributes to a major portion of the total cost to inspect and assess sewer pipes. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to automatically label defects in sewer inspection videos has been developed to assist in the process of condition assessment, and the technology is currently being implemented on multiple projects. This paper will focus primarily on the AI and deep learning processes developed to assist human reviewers in creating the condition assessment deliverables, and on a case study, comparing the AI-enabled CCTV inspection workflow as carried out in the field with the conventional (manual) inspection workflow requiring real-time data entry by a camera operator. Results indicate an AI-assisted workflow enables nearly a 100% increase in field productivity without requiring any capital expenditure for contractors or sewer agencies.","[Sullivan, Eric S.; Kumar, Srinath S.] SewerAI, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA",,"Sullivan, ES (corresponding author), SewerAI, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA.",esullivan@sewerai.com; skumar@sewerai.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,2,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8360-2,,,,2021,,,,,,,144,150,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BS1QC,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000694698800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study discusses the latest research on artificial intelligence (AI) in sugarcane farming, with particular attention given to soil biochemistry, disease detection, climate-smart technology for greenhouse gas emissions, yield and water productivity prediction, and cane juice biochemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as machine learning algorithms, can optimize irrigation, increase yields, save water, and properly estimate sugarcane production. Because of the effectiveness, affordability, and efficiency of AI, it is essential in sugarcane agriculture for accurate yield forecasting as well as for streamlining resource allocation and crop management. AI facilitates prompt interventions by assisting in early disease identification and production prediction. AI can also forecast soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, which can help guide sustainability and soil health initiatives.

Within the AI domain, Machine Learning (ML) techniques stand out as essential facilitator largely enabling machines to possess human-like cognitive and decision making capabilities. This paper provides a focused review of the literature addressing applications of emerging ML tools to solve various Project Scheduling Problems (PSPs). In particular, it employs bibliometric and network analysis tools along with a systematic literature review to analyze a pool of 104 papers published between 1985 and August 2021. The conducted analysis unveiled the top contributing authors, the most influential papers as well as the existing research tendencies and thematic research topics within this field of study. A noticeable growth in the number of relevant studies is seen recently with a steady increase as of the year 2018. Most of the studies adopted Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Network and Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle PSPs under a stochastic environment, where these techniques are frequently hybridized with classical metaheuristics. The majority of works (57%) addressed basic Resource Constrained PSPs and only 15% are devoted to the project portfolio management problem. Furthermore, this study clearly indicates that the application of AI techniques to efficiently handle PSPs is still in its infancy stage bringing out the need for further research in this area. This work also identifies current research gaps and highlights a multitude of promising avenues for future research.","[Bahroun, Zied; As'ad, Rami; Alnajar, Mohamad] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn, PO Box 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Tanash, Moayad] Hashemite Univ, Dept Ind Engn, PO Box 33012, Zarqa, Jordan",American University of Sharjah; Hashemite University,"Bahroun, Z (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn, PO Box 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",zbahroun@aus.edu,"As'ad, Rami/AAI-5880-2021; Bahroun, Zied/F-6863-2019","Bahroun, Zied/0000-0003-2832-3672; Tanash, Moayad/0000-0002-3016-7122",,,,,146,7,7,14,50,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2299-0461,2450-5781,,MANAG SYST PROD ENG,Manag.

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual study aims to identify the philosophical birth of the idea that a person can be understood as a robot or a machine. This idea is subsequently analysed in the light of complex scientific interest with the question, how far the technological development of AI projects represent the separation of scientific approach and its reduction on informational and mechanical functions revealing the ethical consequences for management. Findings: The study reveals the original philosophical foundations of AI principles and their positivist approaches. The application of AI is important for the deeper awareness of managerial responsibility and new treats for individuals and society in the future. Research/practical implications: The impact of the study rests in the ethical dilemma that needs to question the promotion and application of AI.

Although undocumented, Architecture Knowledge (AK) is dispersed across various sources such as source code, documentation, and runtime logs. To address this, automated tools for efficient AK extraction and documentation are essential. Even after generating AK, navigating through vast the Architectural Records can be overwhelming. Building on that, we propose an automated Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) System using Information Extraction and Generative AI, which generates AK from various source for a given system and answers architectural queries with respect to the given system. The development of an efficient Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) system, which is both effective and user-friendly, entails the resolution of numerous challenges. It requires consolidating diverse AK data sources scattered across code, diagrams, repository commits, and online platforms. The integration of Multimodal AI for AK extraction, incorporation of global AK, and leveraging Generative AI for AK documentation further compounds the problem. Moreover, generating contextually appropriate query responses adds another layer of complexity. To this end, we performed an initial exploratory study on generating Architectural Design Decisions using generative Large Language Models (LLM) in the context of Architecture Decision Records (ADR). Our initial results have been promising indicating the potential impact of GenAI for architectural knowledge management.","[Dhar, Rudra; Vaidhyanathan, Karthik] IIIT Hyderabad, SERC, Hyderabad, India; [Varma, Vasudeva] IIIT Hyderabad, IREL, Hyderabad, India",International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad; International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad,"Dhar, R (corresponding author), IIIT Hyderabad, SERC, Hyderabad, India.",rudra.dhar@research.iiit.ac.in; karthik.vaidhyanathan@iiit.ac.in; vv@iiit.ac.in,"Vaidhyanathan, Karthik/AGN-5498-2022",,,,,,11,1,1,23,23,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2768-427X,,979-8-3503-6626-6; 979-8-3503-6625-9,Software Architectur,,,2024,,,,,,,163,166,,10.1109/ICSA-C63560.2024.00034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSA-C63560.2024.00034,,,4,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX5XR,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001304558000028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The most common modeling methods for construction planning are linear scheduling (LS), the critical path method (CPM), and discrete-event simulation (DES). While LS and CPM have advantages of visual feedback and simplicity, respectively, DES as a technique for simulating the behavior and output of a real-world process, facility, or system is the most versatile of these methods. However, when the constraints and dimensionality of a planning problem increase, DES methods are cumbersome and struggle to accurately reflect decision options. As an alternative to DES, deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) methods can, through the use of reinforcement learning, more rapidly review and recommend more planning options for scheduling complex construction projects. The goal of this paper is to examine the feasibility of deep learning AI as an alternative to the DES in an existing project planning method, named Foresight. Foresight is a graphical constraint-based method of planning manufacturing and construction processes that uses DES to simulate possible outcomes. This paper presents the process changes necessary in Foresight to accommodate deep learning algorithms, composed of multiple network layers. In addition, challenges of implementing deep learning AI in construction planning are discussed. Early project planning leads to improved performance in terms of cost, schedule, and operations, balancing the competing needs of a project. A new modeling paradigm is proposed that is better suited to the needs of contemporary construction project planning.","[Hatami, Mohsen; Franz, Bryan; Paneru, Suman; Flood, Ian] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Hatami, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",mohsen.hatami@ufl.edu; bfranz@ufl.edu; spaneru@ufl.edu; flood@ufl.edu,"Hatami, Mohsen/Q-8359-2018","Paneru, Suman/0000-0002-7835-7320; Franz, Bryan/0000-0003-1961-921X",,,,,20,8,8,5,33,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8389-3,,,,2022,,,,,,,1171,1178,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BU8LH,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000948933100143,View Full Record in Web of Science

An artificial intelligence (AI) framework is proposed for the categorization of aviation construction projects using different machine-learning (ML) methods with a focus on the UAE as a source of data. Airport construction projects have been seen to share a good deal of similar attributes, which should simplify the decision-making process regarding layouts, design, equipment, labor, budget, complexity, etc. However, the gap in reality is that the huge and scattered sources of data, project specifications, characteristics, and the knowledge from past projects are not utilized in an automated way that could simplify the navigation through projects for better future decision-making. The utilization of AI/ML tools is expected to be useful here in order to reduce the revisions of design and construction rework by classifying the projects and the elements that managers need to consider. The planning, design, and construction of new projects can be improved by identifying the attributes of past projects and categorizing them according to similarities, differences, and complexities. Specifically speaking, a framework of hierarchical clustering and neural networks is integrated together to form the classification model. Upon implementing hierarchical classification and neural networks, it was found that neural networks could demonstrate remarkable classification results; the error in classification was minimal in most of the cases. The advantage of such classification is to help decision-makers utilize best practice from the groups of previous projects, which were classified using both hierarchical and neural networks models. With this classification, rework can be minimized, overhead costs may be reduced, and past best practices can be utilized.","[Alketbi, Mariam Abdalla; Dweiri, Fikri] Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Dalalah, Doraid] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Irbid 22110, Jordan",University of Sharjah; Jordan University of Science & Technology,"Alketbi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",u20106327@sharjah.ac.ae; doraid@just.edu.jo; fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae,"Dweiri, Fikri/F-4221-2019","Dweiri, Fikri/0000-0001-5360-2142",Mariam Alketbi,Mariam Alketbi,This research received no external funding.

In this article, we address these questions by drawing on our first-hand experience of shaping and driving the roll-out of AI governance within AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company. The examples we discuss highlight challenges that any organization attempting to operationalize AI governance will have to face. These include questions concerning how to define the material scope of AI governance, how to harmonize standards across decentralized organizations, and how to measure the impact of specific AI governance initiatives. By showcasing how AstraZeneca managed these operational questions, we hope to provide project managers, CIOs, AI practitioners, and data privacy officers responsible for designing and implementing AI governance frameworks within other organizations with generalizable best practices. In essence, companies seeking to operationalize AI governance are encouraged to build on existing policies and governance structures, use pragmatic and action-oriented terminology, focus on risk management in development and procurement, and empower employees through continuous education and change management.","[Moekander, Jakob; Floridi, Luciano] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Moekander, Jakob] Princeton Univ, Ctr Informat Technol Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sheth, Margi; Gersbro-Sundler, Mimmi; Blomgren, Peder] AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, R&D Data Off, Data Sci & AI, Cambridge, England; [Floridi, Luciano] Univ Bologna, Dept Legal Studies, Bologna, Italy",University of Oxford; Princeton University; AstraZeneca; University of Bologna,"Mökander, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.;Mökander, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Informat Technol Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Sheth, M (corresponding author), AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, R&D Data Off, Data Sci & AI, Cambridge, England.",jakob.mokander@oii.ox.ac.uk; margi.sheth@astrazeneca.com,"Floridi, Luciano/G-7699-2014",,,,,,43,7,7,9,46,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9898,,FRONT COMP SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Whereas KG-based systems are commonly based on a static view with their structure fixed at design time, we argue that the dynamic challenge of inline Human-AI (H-AI) collaboration in industrial settings calls for a late shaping design principle. In contrast to early shaping, which determines the system's behavior at design time in a fine granular manner, late shaping is a coarse-to-fine approach that leaves more space for fine-tuning, adaptation and integration of human intelligence at runtime. In this context we discuss approaches and lessons learned from the European manufacturing project Teaming.AI, https://www.teamingai-project.eu/, addressing general challenges like the modeling of domain expertise with particular focus on vertical knowledge integration, as well as challenges linked to an industrial KG of choice, such as its dynamic population and the late shaping of KG embeddings as the foundation of relational machine learning models which have emerged as an effective tool for exploiting graph-structured data to infer new insights.","[Krause, Franz; Paulheim, Heiko] Univ Mannheim, Data & Web Sci Grp DWS, Mannheim, Germany; [Kiesling, Elmar; Kurniawan, Kabul] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Data Proc & Knowledge Management, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Wirtschaftsuniv, Vienna, Austria; [Kurniawan, Kabul] CDP Ctr Digital Prod GmbH, Austrian Ctr Digital Prod ACDP, Vienna, Austria; [Leva, Maria Chiara; Estrada-Lugo, Hector Diego] TU Dublin Technol Univ Dublin, Fac Sci & Hlth, Dublin, Ireland; [Stuebl, Gernot] PROFACTOR GmbH, Steyr, Austria; [Ure, Nazim Kemal] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Data Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Dominguez-Ledo, Javier] IDEKO Res Ctr, Elgoibar, Spain; [Khan, Maqbool] Inst Appl Sci & Technol PAF IAST, Pak Austria Fachhochschule, Haripur, Pakistan; [Khan, Maqbool; Heinzl, Bernhard; Hoch, Thomas; Martinez-Gil, Jorge; Silvina, Agastya; Moser, Bernhard A.] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg SCCH, Hagenberg, Austria; [Demolder, Pedro; Gaux, Hans] Timelex BV SRL, Brussels, Belgium",University of Mannheim; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Upper Austrian Research GmbH; PROFACTOR; Istanbul Technical University; Softwarepark Hagenberg,"Moser, BA (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg SCCH, Hagenberg, Austria.",bernhard.moser@scch.at,"Paulheim, Heiko/AAE-8132-2020; KURNIAWAN, KABUL/AAN-4041-2021; Martinez Gil, Jorge/O-4784-2016","Estrada-Lugo, Hector Diego/0000-0001-5929-6414; Martinez Gil, Jorge/0000-0002-5730-7965; Dominguez, Javier/0000-0001-8960-0595; Paulheim, Heiko/0000-0003-4386-8195",sterreichische Forschungsfrderungsgesellschaft10.13039/501100004955; European project Teaming,sterreichische Forschungsfrderungsgesellschaft10.13039/501100004955; European project Teaming,"We would like to thank the corporate partners GOIMEK, Farplas and IAlegre of the European project Teaming.

Delays can be caused by several project components; however, the issue is amplified when delays occur simultaneously. Classifying delays is relevant in order to allocate responsibility to the parties. In Italy, the delay in the delivery of medium and large-sized works in residential urban centers is about 15% compared to the project forecast. Moreover, the AECO sector's ability to adapt to emerging challenges, such as environmental sustainability and digitization, is limited by the lack of innovation in management methods. The aim of this research is to create a methodology for managing the built and to-be-built environment in a digital way. This will optimize the building process by reducing delays and waste of resources. The methodology will use tools such as digital twin (DT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. The integration of lean construction practices can make the use of these technologies even more efficient, supporting better workflow management by using the BIM environment. The paper presents a methodology that can be applied to various scaling factors and scenarios. It is also useful for construction sites that are already in progress.

This technology has demonstrated its great potential in enhancing safety and productivity in construction. However, concerns regarding the technical maturity and reliability, safety, and privacy implications have led to a lack of trust in AI among stakeholders and end users in the construction industry, which slows the intelligent transformation of the industry, particularly for on-site AI implementation. This paper reviews frameworks for AI system design across various sectors and government regulations and requirements for achieving trustworthy and responsible AI. The principles for the AI system design are then determined. Furthermore, a lifecycle design framework specifically tailored for AI systems deployed in the construction industry is proposed. This framework addresses six key phases, including planning, data collection, algorithm development, deployment, maintenance, and archiving, and clarifies the design principles and development priorities needed for each phase to enhance AI system trustworthiness and acceptance. This framework provides design guidance for the implementation of AI in the construction industry, particularly for on-site applications, aiming to facilitate the intelligent transformation of the construction industry.","[Yang, Lichao; Zhang, Zichao; Zhao, Yifan] Cranfield Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Cranfield MK43 0AL, England; [Allen, Gavin] Glideology, Malvern WR14 4PA, England",Cranfield University,"Zhao, YF (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Cranfield MK43 0AL, England.",lichao.yang@cranfield.ac.uk; gavin.allen@glideology.co.uk; zichao.zhang.960@cranfield.ac.uk; yifan.zhao@cranfield.ac.uk,"Yang, Lichao/ABU-3797-2022","Zhao, Yifan/0000-0003-2383-5724",Innovate UK; [10093011],Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK);,"This work was supported by TRAMS-Enterprise-Trustworthy, Responsible AI and ML for construction, Secure and Enterprise Ready funded by Innovate UK (Ref: 10093011).",,91,0,0,25,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JAN,2025,15,1,,,,,,,21,10.3390/buildings15010021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings15010021,,,17,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,R8E9M,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001393724200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a significant lack of management tools for repetitive projects accounting for uncertainties in the construction environment. The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for the optimized scheduling of repetitive construction projects under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach - Fuzzy set theory is utilized to model uncertainties associated with various input parameters. The developed algorithm has two main components: optimization component and buffering component. The optimization component presents a dynamic programming approach that processes fuzzy numbers. The buffering component converts the optimized fuzzy schedule into a deterministic schedule and inserts time buffers to protect the schedule against anticipated delays. Agreement Index (AI) is used to capture the user's desired level of confidence in the produced schedule while sizing buffers. The algorithm is capable of optimizing for cost or time objectives. An example project drawn from literature is analysed to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed algorithm and to allow comparison of results to those previously generated. Findings - Testing the algorithm revealed several findings. Fuzzy numbers can be utilized to capture uncertainty in various inputs without the need for historical data. The modified algorithm is capable of optimizing schedules, for different objectives, under uncertainty. Finally AI can be used to capture users' desired confidence in the final schedule. Originality/value - Project planners can utilize this algorithm to optimize repetitive projects schedules, while modelling uncertainty in different input parameters, without the need for relevant historical data.","[Bakry, Ibrahim; Moselhi, Osama; Zayed, Tarek] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Bakry, I (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",bakryibrahim@yahoo.com,"Zayed, Tarek/L-6437-2018","Zayed, Tarek/0000-0003-3249-7712; Bakry, Ibrahim/0000-0002-4227-5112",,,,,38,40,42,7,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The aim of the paper is to present a novel AI-powered communication and engagement framework for energy projects. The method can assist project managers of energy projects to develop AI-powered virtual communication and engagement agents for engaging their citizens and their network of stakeholders who influence their energy projects. Unlike the standard consultation techniques and large-scale deliberative engagement approaches that require face-to-face engagement, the virtual engagement platform provides citizens with a forum to continually influence project outcomes at the comfort of their homes or anywhere via mobile devices. In the communication and engagement process, the project managers' cognitive capability can be augmented with the probabilistic capability of the algorithm to gain insights into the stakeholders' positive and negative feelings on the project, in order to devise interventions to co-develop an acceptable energy project. The proposed method was developed using the combined capability of fuzzy logic and a deep neural network incorporated with a Likert scaling strategy to reason with and engage people. In a mainstream deep neural network, one requires lots of data to build the system. The novelty of our system, however, in relation to the mainstream deep neural network approach, is that one can even use small data of a few hundreds to build the system. Further, its performance can be improved over time as it learns more about the future.

In the current AI practices, machines predominantly plan, manage, control, and optimize work without appropriately considering human-related input and preferences. However, architects, engineers, managers, clients, and other decision makers should consider their input into their work to better generate their desired ideas, prototypes, and solutions. In addition, significant decisions in the AEC industry are mainly reliant on the heuristic processes where assumptions are developed from past experience. However, the current level of AI is not able to properly deal with such human information and experience. This fact especially in large projects can result in a failure to properly utilize the full benefits of AI. Thus, human-centered AI is an essential need to help the machines understand and utilize human input for amplifying human abilities and reflecting realistic conceptions in the AEC industry. This paper presents the major aspects and applications of human-centered AI in the AEC industry and discusses the anticipated benefits and challenges of this technology. Human-centered AI, mainly via natural language processing and machine reading comprehension, can understand and learn from human interests, preferences, languages, and behaviors for providing human-centered environments, systems, and approaches that satisfy human interests and preferences. As the major benefits, human-centered AI is expected to result in architectural processing optimization, design and engineering capability enhancement, data driven project management, collaboration improvement, and safety enhancement. Personalization of human-centered AI and training its systems are considered as the major challenges in developing this technology in the AEC industry. In addition, AEC-specific guidelines and statements should be regulated in developing human-centered AI utilized in hazardous areas. Human-centered AI is anticipated to provide the highest level of human control in the current fast-growing automation of the AEC industry.","[Rafsanjani, Hamed Nabizadeh] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Nabizadeh, Amir Hossein] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Futures Studies Hlth, Med Informat Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran; [Nabizadeh, Amir Hossein] INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal",Mississippi State University; Kerman University of Medical Sciences; Universidade de Lisboa; INESC-ID,"Rafsanjani, HN (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",hrafsanjani@caad.msstate.edu,,,Mississippi State University,Mississippi State University,"This work was supported by a grant from Mississippi State University.

Large language models (LLMs) are one type of AI that has become particularly popular. Currently, there is a paucity of literature analyzing the impact that AI may have on trainee education. As such, we sought to assess the benefits and pitfalls that AI may have on pain medicine trainee education. Given the rapidly increasing popularity of LLMs, we particularly assessed how these LLMs may promote and hinder trainee education through a pilot quality improvement project.Materials and MethodsA comprehensive search of the existing literature regarding AI within medicine was performed to identify its potential benefits and pitfalls within pain medicine. The pilot project was approved by UPMC Quality Improvement Review Committee (#4547). Three of the most commonly utilized LLMs at the initiation of this pilot study - ChatGPT Plus, Google Bard, and Bing AI - were asked a series of multiple choice questions to evaluate their ability to assist in learner education within pain medicine.ResultsPotential benefits of AI within pain medicine trainee education include ease of use, imaging interpretation, procedural/surgical skills training, learner assessment, personalized learning experiences, ability to summarize vast amounts of knowledge, and preparation for the future of pain medicine. Potential pitfalls include discrepancies between AI devices and associated cost-differences, correlating radiographic findings to clinical significance, interpersonal/communication skills, educational disparities, bias/plagiarism/cheating concerns, lack of incorporation of private domain literature, and absence of training specifically for pain medicine education. Regarding the quality improvement project, ChatGPT Plus answered the highest percentage of all questions correctly (16/17). Lowest correctness scores by LLMs were in answering first-order questions, with Google Bard and Bing AI answering 4/9 and 3/9 first-order questions correctly, respectively. Qualitative evaluation of these LLM-provided explanations in answering second- and third-order questions revealed some reasoning inconsistencies (e.g., providing flawed information in selecting the correct answer).ConclusionsAI represents a continually evolving and promising modality to assist trainees pursuing a career in pain medicine. Still, limitations currently exist that may hinder their independent use in this setting. Future research exploring how AI may overcome these challenges is thus required. Until then, AI should be utilized as supplementary tool within pain medicine trainee education and with caution.","[Glicksman, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh Med Ctr UPMC, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, 3471 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA; [Wang, Sheri] Univ Pittsburgh Med Ctr UPMC, Dept Anesthesiol & Perioperat Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Yellapragada, Samir] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Robinson, Christopher] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA USA; [Orhurhu, Vwaire] Univ Pittsburgh Med Ctr UPMC, Susquehanna, Williamsport, PA USA; [Orhurhu, Vwaire] MVM Hlth, E Stroudsburg, PA USA; [Emerick, Trent] Univ Pittsburgh Med Ctr UPMC, Dept Anesthesiol & Perioperat Med, Chron Pain Div, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Glicksman, M (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh Med Ctr UPMC, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, 3471 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA.",glicks17@gmail.com,,"Robinson, Christopher/0000-0002-6276-9056",,,,,63,1,1,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-7085,1533-2500,,PAIN PRACT,Pain Pract.,JAN,2025,25,1,,,,,,,,10.1111/papr.13428,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/papr.13428,,NOV 2024,10,Anesthesiology; Clinical Neurology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anesthesiology; Neurosciences & Neurology,Q8Y2Z,39588809,hybrid,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001362765100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To gain insights into CSCRM research, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis covering the period from 1999 to 2023. The findings of this comprehensive analysis shed light on various aspects, including risk management phases, classification of micro or macrolevel risks, traditional approaches, and the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Through an extensive database search, relevant articles on CSCRM were identified for analysis. The review reveals that while traditional techniques such as surveys, case studies, and statistical tools remain prominent, there is an increasing adoption of AI methods. Initially focused on risk identification, assessment, and analysis; the CSCRM phases have expanded over time to include risk allocation, prioritization, and recovery. Analysis of publication trends shows a rise in the use of AI techniques since 2016 alongside persistent utilization of traditional approaches. Moreover, influential authors, journals, and collaborative networks are highlighted to provide valuable insights into the field 's development. Overall visualization contributes to advancing both research and practice in CSCRM by presenting a holistic overview of theories, methods, and emerging technologies within the field along with critical risk management approaches and publication trends.","[Shishehgarkhaneh, Milad Baghalzadeh; Moehler, Robert C.; Fang, Yihai] Monash Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Moehler, Robert C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Australia; [Aboutorab, Hamed] UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hijazi, Amer A.] Al Ahliyya Amman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Amman 19328, Jordan",Monash University; University of Melbourne; University of New South Wales Sydney; Al-Ahliyya Amman University,"Moehler, RC (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",robert.moehler@unimelb.edu.au,"Moehler, Robert/ISS-1545-2023; Aboutorab, Hamed/W-7885-2019; Hijazi, Amer A./KDF-4386-2024","Baghalzadeh Shishehgarkhaneh, Milad/0000-0002-7737-7661; Moehler, Robert/0000-0003-0003-2478",,,,,143,6,6,62,107,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

In the past 20 years, researchers made various attempts in applying AI as a supporting tool in construction management, unfortunately, most of these attempts are neither mature enough nor well developed, due to the sophisticated nature of the construction industry considering its diversified fields. Overviewing construction projects and shedding light on the construction management stages, it can be clear, identification, categorization, and impact assessment of contractual risks consumes extensive amounts of effort and time during the estimation process in the tendering stage. This process has proven to be very challenging and risky due to the tight duration usually allocated for such crucial activities. Consequently, hurrying the aforesaid bidders most likely leads to inaccurate pricing leading to unavoidable legal disputes threatening construction projects' success. Therefore, developing an AI model for bidders to support them in proper and accurate pricing, and the early stage enhancement of the risk management, in addition to a potential reduction in the possible disputes that might arise between contracting parties at a later stage. This research presents a supervised machine learning model programmed using Python language, adopting artificial neural networks (ANN), established, and trained to identify the risky clauses, their level of severity, and their expected impact (time, cost, or both). The collected data set extracted from real five construction contracts generating 486 clauses; these clauses were analyzed by eight domain experts (through two-stage interviews) to provide risk ranking and its probable impact through a predetermined question. A preprocessing stage is conducted for utilizing the collected interview replies in a suitable format for the ANN model. The python-based model uses transformers to predict clauses' risk rank and their probable impact. The data set is split into 80% training and 20% validation, results show high validation percentages for risk impact and risk ranking.","[Hamdy, Khaled; AbdelRasheed, Ibrahim; Essawy, Yasmeen A.

Objectives To identify priority areas for AI and PC in Ontario, Canada. Methods A collaborative consultation event engaged multiple stakeholders in a nominal group technique process to generate, discuss and rank ideas for how AI can support Ontario PC. Results The consultation process produced nine ranked priorities: (1) preventative care and risk profiling, (2) patient self-management of condition(s), (3) management and synthesis of information, (4) improved communication between PC and AI stakeholders, (5) data sharing and interoperability, (6-tie) clinical decision support, (6-tie) administrative staff support, (8) practitioner clerical and routine task support and (9) increased mental healthcare capacity and support. Themes emerging from small group discussions about barriers, implementation issues and resources needed to support the priorities included: equity and the digital divide; system capacity and culture; data availability and quality; legal and ethical issues; user-centred design; patient-centredness; and proper evaluation of AI-driven tool implementation. Discussion Findings provide guidance for future work on AI and PC. There are immediate opportunities to use existing resources to develop and test AI for priority areas at the patient, provider and system level. For larger scale, sustainable innovations, there is a need for longer-term projects that lay foundations around data and interdisciplinary work.

This editorial explores the integration of AI technologies, including machine learning, computer vision, and augmented reality, which empower surgeons with tools that improve precision and reduce complications. AI-driven platforms, such as the Artificial intelligence Radiomics Genomics Oncopathomics and Surgomics (AiRGOS) Project, demonstrate the potential of integrating multiomics data-including radiomics, genomics, and pathomics-to provide a comprehensive understanding of patient-specific disease profiles and inform individualized treatment plans. AI's role extends beyond the operating room, with virtual reality simulations and 3D printing enhancing surgical training and education, allowing for risk-free practice of complex procedures. AI also plays a pivotal role in post-operative care, where predictive models help anticipate complications and optimize patient management. Despite these advancements, the adoption of AI in surgery faces significant ethical and technological challenges, including data security, trust in AI-driven decision-making, and maintaining transparency in patient-provider interactions. Addressing these issues through multidisciplinary collaboration and continued technological refinement is essential to fully realize AI's potential in advancing the safety, efficacy, and personalization of surgical care.","[Lee, Wayne] Columbia Univ, Inst Human Nutr, New York, NY USA; [Grasso, S.

Existing 5D BIM tools are used to estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of standardization in the use of model elements through the project lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined. According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of a cost estimation project. It was also revealed that 5D BIM improves project cost visualization and budget control.","[Pishdad, Pardis; Onungwa, Ihuoma O.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Pishdad, P (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",pardis.pishdad@design.gatech.edu; ionungwa3@gatech.edu,,"Onungwa, Ihuoma/0000-0002-9500-4420",,,,,53,0,0,36,38,INT COUNCIL RESEARCH & INNOVATION BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION,ROTTERDAM,"KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS",1874-4753,,,J INF TECHNOL CONSTR,J.

J,"Scheiner, J; Berliner, L",,,,"Scheiner, Jonathan; Berliner, Leonard",,,Avoiding missed opportunities in AI for radiology,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Return on investment; Economics,,"PurposeIn the last decade, the development of Deep Learning and its variants, based on the application of artificial neural networks, has reinvigorated Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a result, many new applications of AI in medicine, especially Radiology, have been introduced. This resurgence in AI, and its diverse clinical and nonclinical applications throughout healthcare, requires a thorough understanding to reap the potential benefits and avoid the potential pitfalls. MethodsTo realize the full potential of AI in medicine, a highly coordinated approach should be undertaken to select, support and finance more highly focused AI projects. By studying and understanding the successes and failures, and strengths and limitations, of AI in Radiology, it is possible to seek and develop the most clinically relevant AI algorithms. The authors have reviewed their clinical practice regarding the use of AI to determine applications in which AI can add both clinical and remunerative benefits. ResultsReview of our policies and applications regarding AI in the Department of Radiology emphasized that, at the time of this writing, AI has been useful in the detection of specific clinical entities for which the AI algorithms have been designed. In addition to helping to reduce diagnostic errors, AI offers an important opportunity to prioritize positive cases, such as pulmonary embolism or intracranial hemorrhage. It has become apparent that the detection of certain conditions, such as incidental and unsuspected cerebral aneurysms can be used to initiate a variety of patient-oriented activities. Finding an unsuspected brain aneurysm is not only of clinical importance to the patient, but the required clinical workup and management of the patient can help generate reimbursement that helps defray the cost of AI implementations. A program for screening, clinical management, and follow-up, facilitated by the AI detection of incidental brain aneurysms, has been implemented at our multi-hospital healthcare system. ConclusionWe feel that it is possible to avoid missed opportunities for AI in Radiology and create AI tools to enhance medical wisdom and improve patient care, within a fiscally responsive environment.","[Scheiner, Jonathan; Berliner, Leonard] Staten Isl Univ Hosp Northwell Hlth, Dept Radiol, 475 Seaview Ave, Staten Isl, NY 10305 USA",Northwell Health,"Berliner, L (corresponding author), Staten Isl Univ Hosp Northwell Hlth, Dept Radiol, 475 Seaview Ave, Staten Isl, NY 10305 USA.",jscheiner@northwell.edu; lberliner1@northwell.edu,"Berliner, Leonard/KFR-7642-2024","Berliner, Leonard/0000-0001-5590-4339",,,,,13,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-6410,1861-6429,,INT J COMPUT ASS RAD,Int.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate transformational change and disruption. Thus, AI can have major impacts on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to food systems. This paper focuses on critically exploring different aspects during the implementation of a software project in US schools that used AI techniques to enable agility and provide healthy food options for schoolchildren. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis were used to inform the case study and uncover the new processes developed using the technology. As a key barrier to the effective management of school food programs and nutrition is the administrative load associated with statutory compliance, this case study demonstrates the difference that AI-powered tools can make in alleviating the weight of administrative processes. An Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled boundary spanning framework is used to extend the case study toward an analysis of the systems, boundaries, relationships and perspectives which starts mapping the areas where the private sector, public institutions and civil society can meet to fast-track sustainable transition activities, particularly in the context of food systems. This article presents some possible approaches to facilitating these activities, inviting policy makers to bridge the gap with businesses and use business agility to support common societal goals to achieve sustainable food systems.","[Camarena, Stephanie] Technol Univ, Royal Melbourne Inst, Sch Design, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Camarena, Stephanie] Food Agil CRC Ltd, Ultimo, NSW, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Camarena, S (corresponding author), Technol Univ, Royal Melbourne Inst, Sch Design, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Camarena, S (corresponding author), Food Agil CRC Ltd, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.",stephanie.camarena@student.rmit.edu.au,"Camarena, Stephanie/P-9198-2018","Camarena, Stephanie/0000-0002-7626-7858",,,,,61,2,2,3,33,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

Due to the retirement of many long-standing employees, companies risk losing tacit experimental know-how. This specific type of knowledge is difficult to capture and transfer to unexperienced workers. The objective of the research project KI_eeper - Know how to keep is to solve this challenge by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the development of a self-learning assistance system. Knowledge transfer as well as AI can cause fears among workforces, which hampers user acceptance of new AI-based tools. Therefore, the employees got proactively involved from an early development stage on through different measures, like e. g. workshops and process analyses. In particular the ELSI+UX workshop openly embraces potential challenges of AI implementation and the fears of employees. Furthermore, the employees get the chance to provide direct feedback about the technical solution of how user-friendly it is for their work process. This contribution focuses on the conception and realization of an ELSI+UX workshop. In the workshop the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) as well as user experience (UX) of the technical conception were assessed by the employees. This approach promoted substantial progress of the project and nurtured user acceptance of the AI system. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Recently, several studies have explored the concept of digital twin (DT) integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for real-time project organization and predictive analyses. This study proposes a new framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into an audio-based DT system for autonomous monitoring and management of paving activities in a roadway construction site. The objective of this study is to develop a framework that autonomously optimizes work cycles and resource allocation according to real-time site activities and data collected from diverse sensors. The framework obtained real-time data from the construction site through sensors and processed it on a cloud-based platform using DRL to autonomously optimize the work cycle and manage the resources involved in paving activity. This system is expected to be highly beneficial for reducing manual labor, idle time, human error, and wastage of resources in monitoring a gigantic-sized transportation construction site and managing complicated logistics.","[Deria, Anisha; Ghannad, Pedram; Lee, Yong-Cheol] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Lee, YC (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",aderia2@lsu.edu; gpedra1@lsu.edu; yclee@lsu.edu,,"Ghannad, Pedram/0000-0002-5279-0548",,,,,33,6,6,4,24,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8396-1,,,,2022,,,,,,,530,540,,,,,,11,"Engineering, Aerospace; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Computer Science,BS8SX,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000776568400056,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this research question, this study aims to conduct a state-of-the-art review of AI in CC in the CI by providing a qualitative discussion of the main research hotspots, research gaps, and future research directions. This review study used a four-step bibliometric-systematic review approach consisting of literature search, literature screening, science mapping analysis, and qualitative dis-cussion. The results found four main research hotspots, namely (1) construction project performance indicators, (2) data analysis and visualization, (3) construction quality control and safety, and (4) construction energy efficiency. These findings would provide valuable insights for scholars and practitioners seeking to understand and integrate AI and CC technology applications in the CI.

The long-term discipline of scenario technique is integrated into the discipline of crisis management to enable short-term and continuous crises management in an automated manner. For this purpose, a practical crisis definition is given and interpreted as a process. Then, a cascading model is derived in which crises are continuously thought through using the scenario technique and three types of observations are classified: Incidents, disturbances, and crises. The presented model is exemplified within a non-technical application of a use case in the context of humanitarian logistics and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, first technical insights from the field of AI are given in the form of a semantic description composing a knowledge graph.

The field notes of the ethnographer, working as a full-time intern in a running AI project within this lab, is the basis for the qualitative data for this study. We discuss the socio-technical aspects and the specific challenges of distributed team-working due to the WFH norms facing such emerging research units, which are rapidly diffusing across the IT industry in the offshoring context, particularly in India. We rely on work system theory as a map to bring out key findings from our ethnographic observations. The findings point to the importance of having workflows compatible with the specific work roles in such emerging work systems - particularly for the beginner roles in the AI space. Our study contributes to the IS literature by depicting the challenges of distributed teams in a relatively novel setting emerging in offshoring contexts like the Indian IT sector, and suggests implications for managers handling AI projects and tackling employee-focused Human Resource practices in such settings.","[Venumuddala, Vinay Reddy] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Bengaluru, India; [Kamath, Rajalaxmi] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Ctr Publ Policy, Bengaluru, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Venumuddala, VR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Bengaluru, India.",yinay.yenumuddala17@iimb.ac.in; rajalaxmik@iimb.ac.in,,,,,,,64,11,13,5,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

One of the essential processes in software engineering is to accurately and reliably estimate the required effort and cost to complete the projects. The domain of software cost estimation has witnessed a prominent surge in research activities in recent years and being an evolving process, it keeps opening new avenues, each with advantages and disadvantages, making it important to work out better options. This research aims to identify the factors that influence the software effort estimation using the constructive cost model (COCOMO), and artificial neural networks (ANN) model by introducing a novel cost estimation approach, COCOMO-ANN (CANN), utilizing a partially connected neural network (PCNN) with inputs derived from calibrated values of the COCOMO model. A publicly available dataset (COCOMONASA 2), various combinations of activation functions, and layer densities have been systematically explored, employing multiple evaluation metrics such as MAE, MRE, and MMRE. In the PCNN model, the ReLU activation function and a 1000-dense layer have demonstrated better performance. While layer density generally correlates with better outcomes, this correlation is not universally applicable for all activation functions and outcomes vary across different combinations. The use of the relationships between 26 key parameters of COCOMO in PCNN produced better results than FCNN by 0.59%, achieving an MRE of 6.55 and an MMRE of 7.04. The results indicated that the CANN model (COCOMO & ANN) presented better results than existing models.","[Rashid, Chaudhry Hamza; Khattak, Bilal Hassan Ahmed] Abasyn Univ, Dept Comp, Islamabad Campus, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Shafi, Imran] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Coll Elect & Mech Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Safran, Mejdl; Alfarhood, Sultan] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Comp Sci, POB 51178, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia; [Ashraf, Imran] Yeungnam Univ, Informat & Commun Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; King Saud University; Yeungnam University,"Alfarhood, S (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Comp Sci, POB 51178, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.;Ashraf, I (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Informat & Commun Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",ghumman6959@gmail.com; imranshafi@ceme.nust.edu.pk; bha.khattak@gmail.com; mejdl@ksu.edu.sa; sultanf@ksu.edu.sa; imranshafi@ceme.nust.edu.pk,"Shafi, Imran/GYR-1309-2022; Khattak, Bilal/JHT-2874-2023; Ashraf, Imran/T-3635-2019; Safran, Mejdl/HMU-9371-2023; Rashid, Chaudhry/LFT-0804-2024; Alfarhood, Sultan/HIK-0580-2022","Alfarhood, Sultan/0009-0001-1268-9613; Khattak, Bilal/0009-0005-1753-7028","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSPD2024R890]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research is funded by the Researchers Supporting Project Num-ber (RSPD2024R890) , King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,51,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1110-0168,2090-2670,,ALEX ENG J,Alex.

The goal of this paper is to provide a much-needed analysis, interpreted in an international context, on what the leaders of academic libraries in East-Central Europe, and specifically in Hungary, think about AI and its implementation in a library setting. The survey shows that according to library directors AI is more of an opportunity for academic libraries than a threat, and it could provide support in all areas of library operation, including digitising, information service, and education. Findings indicate that a quarter of the Hungarian academic libraries surveyed use AI-supported solutions, mostly in the areas of information retrieval and data processing.

In the digital economy, the known principle of the impossibility to automate chaos is replaced by a need for situational control based on providing multi-level fully functional project management using artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). At the same time, the system of distributed situational centers can become an effective tool for supporting strategic goal-setting. Much that has been done in this field and in the field of AI is of profound significance, but the classical approach to AI cannot embrace the different levels of the subjects' emotions, consciousness, and the collective unconscious. The aspects of breakthrough and disruptive management urgently need to be developed. Attention must be focused on the issue of collective decision making under conditions of uncertainty causes and in unforeseen situations. Priority should be given to the socio-humanitarian and collective cognitive aspects of AI applications. Under these conditions, distributed situational centers system and some methods of AGI become the main cross-cutting digital technologies for ensuring corporate strategic goal-setting in the digital economy.

One of the performance-based approaches to facilitate pavement management decision-making processes is the use of remaining service life (RSL) models. In this study, a detailed step-by-step methodology for the development of pavement performance and RSL prediction models for flexible and composite (asphalt concrete [AC] over jointed plain concrete pavement [JPCP]) pavement systems in Iowa is described. To develop such RSL models, pavement performance models based on statistics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were initially developed. While statistically defined pavement performance models were found to be accurate in predicting pavement performance at project level, AI-based pavement performance models were found to be successful in predicting pavement performance in network level analysis. Network level pavement performance models using both statistics and AI-based approaches were also developed to evaluate the relative success of these two models for network level pavement performance modeling. As part of this study, in the development of pavement RSL prediction models, automation tools for future pavement performance predictions were developed and used along with the threshold limits for various pavement performance indicators specified by the Federal Highway Administration. These RSL models will help engineers in decision-making processes at both network and project levels and for different types of pavement management business decisions.","[Kaya, Orhan; Kim, Sunghwan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn CCEE, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Ceylan, Halil] Iowa State Univ, CCEE, Ctr Excellence COE Gen Aviat, FAA PEGASAS Partnership Enhance Gen Aviat Safety, Ames, IA USA; [Ceylan, Halil] Iowa State Univ, CCEE, Program Sustainable Pavement Engn & Res PROSPER, Ames, IA USA; [Waid, Danny] Iowa Cty Engineers Assoc ICEA Serv Bur, W Des Moines, IA USA; [Moore, Brian P.] ICEA Serv Bur, Res & Analyt, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Kaya, O (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn CCEE, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",okaya@iastate.edu,"KAYA, ORHAN/AAQ-7837-2020; Ceylan, Halil/A-8880-2012","KAYA, ORHAN/0000-0001-6072-3882",Iowa Highway Research Board; Iowa County Engineers Service Bureau,Iowa Highway Research Board; Iowa County Engineers Service Bureau,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the Iowa Highway Research Board and Iowa County Engineers Service Bureau for supporting this study.

It evaluates current practices' alignment with SD, addressing project complexity and uncertainty. Seventy-three articles are analysed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, using descriptive, thematic and bibliometric analyses. Findings show fluctuating trends in ST and SD applications due to COVID-19 in 2019, with notable contributions from China, Australia and the UK. Building projects are the most studied, employing mixed methodologies. Thematic analysis highlights SD's significant role in system representation and risk management, with 80% of studies utilizing SD models for various risk factors. While less common in stakeholder management, SD enhances communication and understanding of stakeholder dynamics. The study advocates for integrating SD modelling in construction management for improved decision-making, risk mitigation and stakeholder engagement for project management practitioners, urging collaboration between academia, industry and policymakers for effective construction policies. Academics and researchers should focus on standardizing SD modelling tools, exploring hybrid methodologies like agent-based modelling, and integrating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance real-time decision-making capabilities. Collaboration between academia, industry practitioners and policymakers is crucial to ensure SD research translates into effective policies and best practices, particularly in safety and environmental impact assessments.","[Ghamarimajd, Zahra; Ghanbaripour, Amir; Watanabe, Tsunemi; Mbachu, Jasper] Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Gold Coast, Australia; [Tumpa, Roksana Jahan; Skitmore, Martin] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Sydney, Australia",Bond University; Central Queensland University,"Ghamarimajd, Z (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Gold Coast, Australia.",zahra.ghamarimajd@student.bond.edu.au,"Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012; Mbachu, Jasper/G-8912-2018; Tumpa, Roksana Jahan/KCK-4255-2024","Mbachu, Jasper/0000-0002-1654-311X; Tumpa, Roksana Jahan/0000-0003-4721-5300",,,,,85,0,0,35,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1092-7026,1099-1743,,SYST RES BEHAV SCI,Syst.

Methods: This research is based on a random sample of 326 large enterprises and SMEs in Slovenia, with an entrepreneur completing a questionnaire in each enterprise. Results: Findings suggest that there are no significant differences between male and female entrepreneurs in Slovenia regarding various aspects of AI-supported entrepreneurial management practice including the following: AI-supported entrepreneurial culture, AI-enhanced leadership, adopting AI to reduce employee workload, and incorporating AI tools into work processes. The widespread integration of AI into entrepreneurship marks a transition to a business landscape that values inclusivity and equity, measuring success through creativity, strategic technology deployment, and leadership qualities, rather than relying on gender-based advantages or limitations. Our research also focused on the identification of gender differences in path coefficients regarding the impact of the four previously mentioned aspects of AI on employee engagement. While both genders see the value in using AI to alleviate employee workload, the path coefficients indicate that female entrepreneurs report higher effectiveness in this area, suggesting differences in the implementation of AI-integrated strategies or tool selection. Male entrepreneurs, on the other hand, appear to integrate AI tools into their work processes more extensively, particularly in areas requiring predictive analytics and project scheduling. This suggests a more technical application of AI in their enterprises. Conclusions: These findings contribute to understanding gender-specific approaches to AI in enterprises and their subsequent effects on employee engagement.","[Rozman, Maja; Tominc, Polona] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Rozman, M (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",maja.rozman1@um.si; polona.tominc@um.si,,"Rozman, Maja/0000-0002-8546-4351",Slovenian Research Agency; [P5-0023],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia);,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (research core funding No. P5-0023, Entrepreneurship for Innovative Society).",,75,1,2,41,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-8954,,SYSTEMS-BASEL,Systems-Basel,MAY,2024,12,5,,,,,,,145,10.3390/systems12050145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems12050145,,,24,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,RZ5I4,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001231488600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have evidenced their capacity to solve dynamic, uncertain and complex tasks. The aim of this current study is to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence model called integrative Random Forest classifier with Genetic Algorithm optimization (RF-GA) for delay problem prediction. At first, related sources and factors of delay problems are identified. A questionnaire is adopted to quantify the impact of delay sources on project performance. The developed hybrid model is trained using the collected data of the previous construction projects. The proposed RF-GA is validated against the classical version of an RF model using statistical performance measure indices. The achieved results of the developed hybrid RF-GA model revealed a good resultant performance in terms of accuracy, kappa and classification error. Based on the measured accuracy, kappa and classification error, RF-GA attained 91.67%, 87% and 8.33%, respectively.

Despite this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), have recently developed as critical technologies for demand-side management and response due to the high complexity of tasks associated with DR, as well as huge amount of data management to take decisions very near to real time implications. Selecting the best group of users to respond, learning their attitude toward consumptions and their priorities, price optimization, monitoring and control of devices, learning to engage more and more consumers in the DR schemes, and learning how to remunerate them fairly and economically are all problems that can be tackled with the help of AI techniques. This study presents an overview of AI approaches used for DR applications. Both the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithm(s) are employed while discussing commercial efforts (from both new and existing businesses) and large-scale innovation projects that have applied AI technologies for energy DR. Different kind of DR programs implemented in different countries are also discussed. Moreover, it also discusses the application of blockchain for DR schemes in smart grid paradigm.

They need to increase glucocorticoids during physical illness or major stressful situations and require parenteral hydrocortisone in the event of an adrenal crisis. Patients with AI have impaired quality of life and high mortality; approximately 1 in 6-12 patients are hospitalised at least once/year from a potentially preventable adrenal crisis. Adoption of self-management behaviours are crucial; these include adherence to medication, following sick day rules and associated behaviours that aid prevention and treatment of adrenal crisis such as symptom monitoring, having extra tablets, carrying a medical-alert ID and injection kit, and self-injecting when necessary. Current patient education is ineffective at supporting self-management behaviour change or reducing adrenal crisis-related hospitalisations. This research study aims to gain an in-depth understanding of the barriers and enablers to self-management for patients with AI and to develop an evidence-based digital self-management behaviour change intervention.Methods: The study is conducted in accordance with the MRC Framework for developing complex interventions. Underpinned by the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and the Person-Based Approach, this research will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1 will involve a sequential qualitative/quantitative mixed-methods study involving focus group interviews followed by a cross-sectional survey with patients with AI recruited from patient advocacy groups and endocrine clinics in the UK. Phase 2 will develop the Support AI, a website-based digital behaviour change intervention (DBCI) informed by Phase 1 findings to support self-management for patients with AI. The most appropriate behaviour change techniques (BCTs) will be selected utilising a nominal group technique with an Expert Panel of 10-15 key stakeholders. The design of the Support AI website will be guided by the Person-Based Approach using an Agile iterative think-aloud technique with 12-15 participants over 3 usability testing iterations.Conclusion: A theory- and evidence-based digital behaviour change intervention will be developed which will be tested in a feasibility randomised trial following completion of this study. The projected benefit includes cost-effective health care service (reduced hospitalisations and demand for specialist services) and improved health outcomes and quality of life for patients with AI.","[Llahana, Sofia; Mulligan, Kathleen; Hirani, Shashivadan P.; Newman, Stanton] City Univ London, Sch Hlth & Psychol Sci, London, England; [Llahana, Sofia; Baldeweg, Stephanie E.] Univ Coll London Hosp Natl Hlth Serv NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Diabet & Endocrinol, London, England; [Mulligan, Kathleen] East London Natl Hlth Serv NHS Fdn Trust, Community Hlth Newham, London, England; [Wilson, Stephanie] City Univ London, Ctr Human Comp Interact HCI Design, Sch Sci & Technol, London, England; [Baldeweg, Stephanie E.] UCL, Ctr Obes & Metab, Dept Expt & Translat Med, Div Med, London, England; [Grossman, Ashley] Royal Free Hosp, Neuroendocrine Tumour NET Unit, London, England; [Grossman, Ashley] Univ Oxford, Green Templeton Coll, Oxford, England; [Norton, Christine] Kings Coll London, Florence Nightingale Fac Nursing Midwifery & Palli, London, England; [Sharman, Philippa] Patient Advocacy Grp Bristol, Addisons Dis Self Help Grp, Bristol, England; [McBride, Pat] Pituitary Fdn Patient Advocacy Grp, Bristol, England","City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London; City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; UCL Medical School; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London","Llahana, S (corresponding author), City Univ London, Sch Hlth & Psychol Sci, London, England.;Llahana, S (corresponding author), Univ Coll London Hosp Natl Hlth Serv NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Diabet & Endocrinol, London, England.",sofia.llahana@city.ac.uk,"Llahana, Sofia/LMO-0076-2024; Newman, Stanton/D-3972-2011","Baldeweg, Stephanie E/0000-0002-8381-1612; Llahana, Sofia/0000-0002-3606-5370; Newman, Stanton/0000-0001-6712-6079",National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) [NIHR301286]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [NIHR301286] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) under its HEE/NIHR ICA Clinical Lecturer Personal Development Award scheme [Grant Reference Number NIHR301286 to Sofia Llahana].,,67,1,1,2,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-2392,,,FRONT ENDOCRINOL,Front.

Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). Therefore, generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of GAI's applications in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature. Finally, this work summarizes the current research on GAI for mobile and wireless networking by outlining important challenges that need to be resolved to facilitate the development and applicability of GAI in this edge-cutting area.","[Vu, Thai-Hoc] Univ Ulsan, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea; [Kumar Jagatheesaperumal, Senthil] Mepco Schlenk Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Sivakasi 626005, India; [Nguyen, Minh-Duong] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Informat Convergence Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Van Huynh, Nguyen] Univ Liverpool, Dept Elect Engn & Elect, Liverpool L69 3GJ, England; [Kim, Sunghwan] Kyonggi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Suwon 16227, South Korea; [Pham, Quoc-Viet] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Stat, Dublin 2, Ireland",University of Ulsan; Mepco Schlenk Engineering College; Pusan National University; University of Liverpool; Kyonggi University; Trinity College Dublin,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Kyonggi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Suwon 16227, South Korea.",vuthaihoc1995@gmail.com; senthilkumarj@mepcoeng.ac.in; duongnm@pusan.ac.kr; huynh.nguyen@liverpool.ac.uk; skim@kyonggi.ac.kr; viet.pham@tcd.ie,"Nguyen, Diep/AAQ-2491-2020; Vu, Thai-Hoc/AAX-6830-2021; Pham, Viet/AAG-2266-2021; Nguyen, Huynh/M-3421-2018; Pham, Viet Quoc/O-2350-2018","Nguyen, Huynh/0000-0002-7696-0521; Pham, Viet Quoc/0000-0002-9485-9216; Nguyen, Duong/0000-0001-9856-2754; Vu, Thai-Hoc/0000-0002-5559-6695",Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2023R1A2C1003546],Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant NRF-2023R1A2C1003546.,,235,2,2,8,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,JAN 15,2025,12,2,,,,,1266,1290,,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3487627,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3487627,,,25,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,S1D3V,,Green Submitted,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001395714600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the critical challenge in utilizing AI models in real-world remote sensing applications is maintaining their robustness and reliability, particularly against adversarial attacks. In adversarial attacks, attackers manipulate benign data to create a perturbation to mislead AI models into predicting incorrect decisions, posing a catastrophic threat to the security of their applications, particularly in crucial decision-making contexts. These attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity and comprehensiveness of AI models in remote sensing applications, as they can lead to inaccurate decisions with substantial consequences. In this paper, we propose to develop an adversarial robustness technique that will ensure the AI model's accurate prediction in the presence of adversarial perturbation. In this work, we address these challenges by developing a better adversarial training approach using explainable AI method-guided features and data augmentation techniques to strengthen the AI model prediction in remote sensing data against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach achieved the best adversarial robustness against Project Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks in EuroSAT and AID datasets and showed transferability of robustness against unseen attacks.","[Tasneem, Sumaiya; Islam, Kazi Aminul] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Marietta, GA 30060 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Islam, KA (corresponding author), Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Marietta, GA 30060 USA.",stasneem@students.kennesaw.edu; kislam4@kennesaw.edu,,,,,,,27,0,0,18,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2024,16,17,,,,,,,3210,10.3390/rs16173210,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16173210,,,17,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,F7H7Y,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001311493600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, to enhance the body of relevant literature, this study examines the existing challenges of AI implementation in PMS of India and explores the inter-relationships among them. The study has utilized the DEMATEL method for identification of the cause-and-effect group factors. The findings reveal that poor data quality, managers' lack of understanding of cognitive technologies, data privacy, problems in integrating cognitive projects and expensive technologies are the main challenges for AI implementation in PMS of India. Moreover, a model is proposed for industrial decision-makers and managers to take appropriate decisions to develop intelligent AI enabled systems for manufacturing organizations in emerging economies.","[Sharma, Manu] London Metropolitan Univ, Guildhall Sch Business & Law, London, England; [Luthra, Sunil] Ch Ranbir Singh State Inst Engn & Technol CRSSIET, Jhajjar 124103, Haryana, India; [Joshi, Sudhanshu] Doon Univ, Operat & Supply Chain Management Lab, Sch Management, Kedarpur, India; [Kumar, Anil] London Metropolitan Univ, Supply Chain & Business Analyt, Guildhall Sch Business & Law, London, England; [Joshi, Sudhanshu] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",London Metropolitan University; Doon University; London Metropolitan University; University of Technology Sydney,"Luthra, S (corresponding author), Ch Ranbir Singh State Inst Engn & Technol CRSSIET, Jhajjar 124103, Haryana, India.",sharmamanu53@gmail.com; sunillutra1977@gmail.com; sudhanshujoshi@doonuniversity.ac.in; a.kumar@londonmet.ac.uk,"Kumar, Anil/A-2657-2013; Joshi, sudhanshu/Z-1441-2018; Luthra, Sunil/D-4135-2014; Joshi, Sudhanshu/L-2284-2019","Luthra, Sunil/0000-0001-7571-1331; Joshi, Sudhanshu/0000-0003-4748-5001; Kumar, Anil/0000-0002-1691-0098",,,,,77,57,58,21,86,ELSEVIER INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0740-624X,1872-9517,,GOV INFORM Q,Gov.

Enterprise applications increasingly make intensive use of AI technologies and are often based on multiple components running across a computing continuum. However, the heterogeneity of the technologies and software development solutions in use are evolving quickly and are still a challenge for researchers and practitioners. Indeed, lack of solutions tailored for AI applications is observed in the areas of applications placement and design space exploration with performance guarantees, both under-developed. The aim of the AI-SPRINT Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum project is to develop a framework composed of design and runtime management tools to seamlessly design, partition and operate Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications among the current plethora of cloud-based solutions and AI-based sensor devices (i.e., devices with intelligence and data processing capabilities), providing resource efficiency, performance, data privacy, and security guarantees. AI-SPRINT is intended to accelerate the development of AI applications, whose components are spread across the edge-cloud computing continuum, while allowing trading-off application performance and AI models accuracy. This is accomplished by the thorough suite of design tools provided by the AI-SPRINT framework, which exposes a set of programming abstractions with the goal of hiding as much as possible the computing continuum complexity, while further providing a simple interface to define desired constraints upon which the application design is guided.","[Lattari, Francesco; Matteucci, Matteo; Ardagna, Danilo] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn DEIB, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Ardagna, D (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn DEIB, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",francesco.lattari@polimi.it; matteo.matteucci@polimi.it; danilo.ardagna@polimi.it,,,EU [101016577],EU(European Union (EU)),This work is funded by EU Grant no. 101016577.

In this paper, we first propose a new vision for distributed network management and orchestration based on existing standardization architectures. This vision aims to embed AI/Machine Learning (ML) into the AI/ML architectures of Standardization Development Organizations (SDOs) such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Our second contribution is a numerical comparison of the benefits of the proposed distributed management and orchestration approach in terms of energy savings through Federated Learning (FL). The experimental topology includes a sophisticated infrastructure with VR streaming clients and servers, a monitoring system (MS), core network elements, aggregation server for federated learning (FL) and analytics engines (AEs). The deployment uses Kubernetes (K8s) and a top orchestrator that works together with an AI/ML model tailored to the envisioned use case. Experimental studies emulating the demanding Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming have demonstrated the effectiveness of the MonB5G framework in optimizing resource management, reducing overhead and improving energy efficiency. In particular, when convergence is achieved, the monitoring overhead is reduced by more than 11 times compared to the centralised SLA-constrained algorithm, along with data-driven management systems. This led to a more than 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency. At the end of the paper, we also discuss experimental results, VR video streaming specific challenges, scalability considerations and lessons learned throughout the implementation.","[Blanco, Luis] Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Space & Resilient Commun & Syst SRCOM Res Unit, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Zeydan, Engin; Barrachina-Munoz, Sergio; Rezazadeh, Farhad; Mangues-Bafalluy, Josep] Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Serv Networks SaS Res Unit, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Vettori, Luca] Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Packet Opt Networks & Serv PONS Res Unit, Barcelona 08860, Spain",,"Blanco, L (corresponding author), Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Space & Resilient Commun & Syst SRCOM Res Unit, Barcelona 08860, Spain.",luis.blanco@cttc.es,"Mangues-Bafalluy, Josep/AAE-1374-2021; Zeydan, Engin/AAI-2467-2019; Rezazadeh, Farhad/AAH-5623-2021","Barrachina-Munoz, Sergio/0000-0002-7941-1018; Mangues-Bafalluy, Josep/0000-0003-4960-9434; Rezazadeh, Farhad/0000-0001-8992-8152; Vettori, Luca/0000-0001-8543-338X",H2020 MonB5G Project,H2020 MonB5G Project,No Statement Available,,47,3,3,3,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,2644-125X,,IEEE OPEN J COMM SOC,IEEE Open J.

In this article, we give an overview of the significance of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled NGNs, their projected benefits, design requirements, and critical challenges for evolving heterogeneous softwarized networks where microservices can be autonomously orchestrated, scaled, and maintained. The convergence of emerging disruptive technologies, for example, AI, network softwarization, hybrid cloud/edge-native computing architecture, with NGNs accelerates the enhanced service-oriented architecture at the network core/edge level to support on-demand microservices, such as visibility services for intelligent network management. In addition, we present a use case study and conduct experiments based on a novel design of an edge intelligence framework that orchestrates and deploys AI microservices utilizing the testbed resources of a multisite cloud/edge-native NGNs. We use a deep learning-based forecaster model to predict near real-time edge network flow between a centralized service orchestrator hub and multiple edge devices, geographically apart. The obtained results show that the deployed forecaster model accurately predicts the throughput and latency of edge network flow (verified against the groundtruth observations), which is additionally validated through two performance metrics obtained, low root-mean-square error, and high coefficient of determination values. Finally, we outline some of the potential future prospects for AI-enabled NGNs research.","[Zeb, Shah; Hassan, Syed Ali] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Rathore, Muhammad Ahmad] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Gwangju, South Korea; [Raza, Saleem] Quaid e Eawam Univ Coll Engn Sci & Technol, Nawabshah, Pakistan; [Dev, Kapal] Munster Technol Univ, Munster, Ireland; [Dev, Kapal] CONNECT Ctr, Munster, Ireland; [Dev, Kapal] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Fortino, Giancarlo] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); University of Johannesburg; University of Calabria,"Zeb, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.",szeb.dphd19seecs@seecs.edu.pk; ahmadrathore@gist.ac.kr; ali.hassan@seecs.edu.pk; saleem.raza@quest.edu.pk; kapal.dev@ieee.org; giancarlo.fortino@unical.it,"Hassan, Syed/C-1413-2017; Zeb, Shah/AAH-3218-2021; Rathore, Muhammad Ahmad/GRX-5977-2022; Dev, Kapal/LZE-5098-2025; Fortino, Giancarlo/J-2950-2017; Raza, Saleem/T-2094-2019","Raza, Saleem/0000-0002-7408-445X; Zeb, Shah/0000-0001-6797-9506; DEV, KAPAL/0000-0003-1262-8594",,,,,15,6,6,0,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1536-1284,1558-0687,,IEEE WIREL COMMUN,IEEE Wirel.

However, the crowdsourcing process is usually not transparent to a new user. The risk for the execution of a new project for developing a new product is not easy to be calculated [1, 2]. We developed a method InnoCrowd to handle this problem and the new user could use during the planning of a new product development project. This system uses AI concepts to generate a knowledgebase representing histories of successful product development projects. The system uses the knowledge to determine qualitative and quantitative risks of a new project.

AI also revealed sociocultural constraints and needs for training of participants in the value chain, in particular training of young people and women in production and marketing activities. Production research concentrating on resource assessment, adaptation and performance of selected temperate vegetables were undertaken over 3 years in contrasting environments in Central Province.

This study identifies risks and hazards that AI systems may pose to the work health and safety (WHS) of those engaging with or exposed to them. A conceptual framework of organisational measures for minimising those risks is proposed.Design/methodology/approachAdopting an exploratory, inductive qualitative approach, the researchers interviewed 30 experts in data science, technology and WHS; 12 representatives of nine organisations using or preparing to use AI; and ran online workshops, including with 12 WHS inspectors. The research mapped AI ethics principles endorsed by the Australian government onto the AI Canvas, a tool for tracking AI implementation from ideation via development to operation. Fieldwork and analysis developed a matrix of WHS and organisational-managerial risks and risk minimisation strategies relating to AI use at each implementation stage.FindingsThe study identified psychosocial, work stress and workplace relational risks that organisations and employees face during AI implementation in a workplace. Privacy, business continuity and gaming risks were also noted. All may persist and reoccur during the lifetime of an AI system. Alertness to such risks may be enhanced by adopting a systematic risk assessment approach.Originality/valueA collaborative project involving sociologists, economists and computer scientists, the study relates abstract AI ethics principles to concrete WHS risks and hazards. The study translates principles typically applied at the societal level to workplaces and proposes a process for assessing AI system risks.","[Cebulla, Andreas] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Adelaide, Australia; [Szpak, Zygmunt; Knight, Genevieve] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of Adelaide,"Cebulla, A (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Adelaide, Australia.",andreas.cebulla@flinders.edu.au; zygmunt.szpak@ivai.com.au; genevieve.knight@adelaide.edu.au,"Cebulla, Andreas/AAU-7579-2020","Cebulla, Andreas/0000-0002-6853-6245",,,,,76,6,7,11,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8351,1753-836X,,INT J WORKPLACE HEAL,Int.

Despite the considerable hype around AI, recent reports indicate that a very small number of organizations have managed to successfully implement these technologies in their operations. While many early studies and consultancy-based reports point to factors that enable adoption, there is a growing understanding that adoption of AI is rather more of a process of maturity. Building on this more nuanced approach of adoption, this study focuses on the diffusion of AI through a maturity lens. To explore this process, we conducted a two-phased qualitative case study to explore how organizations diffuse AI in their operations. During the first phase, we conducted interviews with AI experts to gain insight into the process of diffusion as well as some of the key challenges faced by organizations. During the second phase, we collected data from three organizations that were at different stages of AI diffusion. Based on the synthesis of the results and a cross-case analysis, we developed a capability maturity model for AI diffusion (AICMM), which was then validated and tested. The results highlight that AI diffusion introduces some common challenges along the path of diffusion as well as some ways to mitigate them. From a research perspective, our results show that there are some core tasks associated with early AI diffusion that gradually evolve as the maturity of projects grows. For professionals, we present tools for identifying the current state of maturity and providing some practical guidelines on how to further implement AI technologies in their operations to generate business value.","[Hansen, Hans Fredrik; Lillesund, Elise] Kristiania Univ Coll, Oslo, Norway; [Mikalef, Patrick] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Sem Saelands Vei 7, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Altwaijry, Najwa] King Saud Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Kristiania University College; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); King Saud University,"Mikalef, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Sem Saelands Vei 7, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",Patrick.mikalef@ntnu.no,"Mikalef, Patrick/GVU-5020-2022; Altwaijry, Najwa/I-3245-2014","Mikalef, Patrick/0000-0002-6788-2277","NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology (incl St. Olavs Hospital - Trondheim University Hospital) [RSPD2024R857]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology (incl St. Olavs Hospital - Trondheim University Hospital); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","Najwa Altwaijry acknowledges the support of Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSPD2024R857) at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,55,1,1,43,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

J,"Serugga, J",,,,"Serugga, Joas",,,Digital Twins and AI Decision Models: Advancing Cost Modelling in Off-Site Construction,ENG,,,English,Article,,,,,,utility theory; artificial intelligence; cost modelling; digital twins offsite construction,,"The rising demand for housing continues to outpace traditional construction processes, highlighting the need for innovative, efficient, and sustainable delivery models. Off-site construction (OSC) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering faster project timelines and enhanced cost management. However, current research on cost models for OSC, particularly in automating material take-offs and optimising cost performance, remains limited. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new cost model integrating Digital Twin (DT) technology and AI-driven decision models for modular housing in the UK. The research explores the role of DTs in enhancing cost estimation and decision-making processes. By leveraging DTs and AI, the proposed model evaluates the impact of emergent technologies on cost performance, material efficiency, and sustainability across social, environmental, and economic dimensions. As proposed, this integrated approach enables a cost model tailored for OSC systems, providing a data-driven foundation for cost optimisation and material take-offs. The study's findings highlight the potential of combining DTs and AI decision models to enhance cost modelling in modular construction, offering new capabilities to support sustainable and performance-driven housing delivery. The paper introduces a dynamic, data-driven cost model integrating real-time data acquisition through DTs and AI-powered predictive analytics. This dynamic approach enhances cost accuracy, reduces lifecycle cost variability, and supports adaptive decision-making throughout the OSC project lifecycle.","[Serugga, Joas] Birmingham City Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Birmingham B4 7RJ, England",Birmingham City University,"Serugga, J (corresponding author), Birmingham City Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Birmingham B4 7RJ, England.",joas.serugga@bcu.ac.uk,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-4117,,ENG-BASEL,Eng,FEB,2025,6,2,,,,,,,22,10.3390/eng6020022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/eng6020022,,,24,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,Y4E9F,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001431686900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These governmental bodies are progressively leveraging AI technologies to enhance service delivery to their communities, ranging from simple task automation to more complex engineering endeavours. As more local governments adopt AI, it is imperative to understand the functions, implications, and consequences of these advanced technologies. Despite the growing importance of this domain, a significant gap persists within the scholarly discourse. This study aims to bridge this void by exploring the applications of AI technologies within the context of local government service provision. Through this inquiry, it seeks to generate best practice lessons for local government and smart city initiatives. By conducting a comprehensive review of grey literature, we analysed 262 real-world AI implementations across 170 local governments worldwide. The findings underscore several key points: (a) there has been a consistent upward trajectory in the adoption of AI by local governments over the last decade; (b) local governments from China, the US, and the UK are at the forefront of AI adoption; (c) among local government AI technologies, natural language processing and robotic process automation emerge as the most prevalent ones; (d) local governments primarily deploy AI across 28 distinct services; and (e) information management, back-office work, and transportation and traffic management are leading domains in terms of AI adoption. This study enriches the existing body of knowledge by providing an overview of current AI applications within the sphere of local governance. It offers valuable insights for local government and smart city policymakers and decision-makers considering the adoption, expansion, or refinement of AI technologies in urban service provision. Additionally, it highlights the importance of using these insights to guide the successful integration and optimisation of AI in future local government and smart city projects, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of communities.","[Yigitcanlar, Tan; David, Anne; Li, Wenda] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, City 4 0 Lab, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Fookes, Clinton] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Robot, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Bibri, Simon Elias] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ye, Xinyue] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Yigitcanlar, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, City 4 0 Lab, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au; annejeevana.david@hdr.qut.edu.au; wenda.li@hdr.qut.edu.au; c.fookes@qut.edu.au; simon.bibri@epfl.ch; xinyue.ye@tamu.edu,"Li, Wenda/ISB-6315-2023; Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012; ye, xinyue/A-7677-2011","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; David, Anne/0009-0007-8518-3780; Li, Wenda/0000-0002-4430-7405; ye, xinyue/0000-0001-8838-9476",Australian Research Council [DP220101255]; Australian Research Council Discovery Grant Scheme,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Discovery Grant Scheme(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery Grant Scheme, grant number DP220101255.",,226,5,5,21,22,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-6511,,SMART CITIES-BASEL,Smart Cities,AUG,2024,7,4,,,,,1576,1625,,10.3390/smartcities7040064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/smartcities7040064,,,50,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Urban Studies",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Urban Studies,F1N2L,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001307547700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To enhance BM performance, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for beam prediction in the evolution toward sixth-generation (6G) communications. The main goals of these 3GPP-based standard studies are to minimize the overhead from reference signals (RSs) and to reduce the number of beam sweepings at the user equipment (UE), which arise due to frequent beam measurements caused by UE movement and rotation. This paper delves into an AI/ML algorithm design that supports spatial domain beam prediction tailored for BM in 6G. This includes forecasting the optimal beam (pairs) and anticipating beam changes. Simulations are based on a data-driven strategy that uses RS receive power (RSRP) measurements as input for fast beam pair prediction with an advanced convolutions neural network (CNN) architecture. Results indicate that the proposed AI/ML model outperforms conventional BM techniques, reducing beam sweeping overhead and thereby validating the AI/ML's potential in BM. Additionally, our proposed algorithm achieves up to 40.58% higher beam prediction accuracy and improves the mean RSRP difference of the predicted best beam pair by up to 2.89 dB.","[Jalali, Jalal; Roa, Juan; Zhao, Renjian; Sheen, Baoling] Futurewei Technol, Wireless Res & Stand, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA; [Song, Yifei] Virginia Tech, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",Huawei Technologies; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Jalali, J (corresponding author), Futurewei Technol, Wireless Res & Stand, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA.",jfaghih@futurewei.com; jroa@futurewei.com; yifeisong@vt.edu; rzhao@futurewei.com; bshee@futurewei.com,"Song, Yifei/GLV-6877-2022; Jalali, Jalal/AAN-4705-2021",,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,979-8-3503-8741-4,VEH TECHNOL CONFE,,,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/VTC2024-SPRING62846.2024.10683207,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VTC2024-SPRING62846.2024.10683207,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Transportation,BX7XH,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001327706001037,View Full Record in Web of Science

The energy sector is going through substantial changes fueled by two key drivers: building a zero-carbon energy sector and the digital transformation of the energy infrastructure. We expect to see the convergence of these two drivers resulting in the IoE, where renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access, privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions, optimization and prioritization services, and automated management of flexible resources.

The changes in a company resulting from the implementation of AI applications can vary from small data format changes over a restructuring of its application landscape to the implementation or deletion of whole business processes or roles. Thus, the implementation of AI applications can significantly impact a company's enterprise architecture (EA). We argue that research could facilitate the adoption of AI and help to preserve AI projects from failing. To determine what further research is necessary, this paper seeks to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art of research on the effects of AI applications on EA. For this purpose, we performed a structured literature review (SLR), formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria, developing several search strings, applying them to four scientific databases, performing a forward and backwards search and summarizing the key findings. The (1) performance of the literature review and the (2) discussion of its findings are the main contributions of this paper, identifying a research gap as no concrete research about the effects of AI applications on enterprise architectures could be found.

The environmental discipline is now experiencing an exponential interest in harnessing the potential of AI over the past decade. We have reviewed the latest applications of AI tools in the environmental disciplines, highlighting the opportunities they present and discussing their advantages and disadvantages in this field. After the emergence of deep learning algorithms in 2010, interest in using AI tools for environmental tasks has grown exponentially. Among the studied articles, over 65 % of environmental tasks that demonstrate interest in using AI tools initially relied on conventional statistical and mathematical models. Using AI tools can greatly benefit the areas of environmental science and engineering. One of the main advantages of utilizing AI tools is their ability to analyze and process large amounts of data efficiently. Recently, the European Union established a European supercomputing ecosystem program to advance science and enhance the quality of life for its citizens. Nine of these projects prioritize environmental and sustainable goals. Despite the benefits of AI, it is still in its early stages of development, which comes with environmental concerns. The amount of power consumed and the time required to train an AI model can greatly affect the carbon emissions it produces, exacerbating the challenges posed by climate change. Efforts are currently underway to develop AI technology that is environmentally sustainable, minimizes energy consumption, and has a low carbon footprint. Selecting the appropriate AI model architecture can reduce energy consumption by almost 90 %. The main finding suggests that collaboration between environmental and AI professionals becomes crucial in leveraging the full potential of AI in addressing pressing environmental challenges.","[Konya, Aniko] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Konya, Aniko] 909 S Wolcott Ave, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Konya, A (corresponding author), 909 S Wolcott Ave, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",akonya@uic.edu,,"Konya, Aniko/0000-0002-3579-0773; Nematzadeh, Peyman/0000-0003-0948-6767",,,,,102,31,33,49,111,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Collected case studies support a Tai Chi-based framework for global project teams to reduce stress and improve decision making through exercises, storytelling, and martial arts practices. The authors first proposed a model or procedural framework based on experiential knowledge from practicing Tai Chi while managing projects. Design/methodology/approach - Analyzing case studies from knowledge managers, project managers, and executive leaders, the researchers collected data on applying the framework from a retrospective case study and from two observational case studies during project development. Tai Chi-based communications and exercises were shown to support critical thinking, knowledge sharing, and problem solving. The proposed framework and four-step procedure build on a global perspective to cultural awareness, creativity, and motivation as well as specific Tai Chi-based tactics, techniques, and operations for knowledge management. This preliminary study looks at improving collaboration in a competitive environment while supporting health, wellness, and work-life enjoyment. Findings - Early research results suggest that teams and individuals working on projects and practicing Tai Chi might develop more cohesive strategies and improve soft skills during their integration of Eastern and Western philosophies. Research limitations/implications - Used case studies methodology, which provided examples of using Tai Chi during projects. Qualitative data used to develop the proposed framework. Also, interviews and discussion reviews conducted for additional validation collected on framework. Practical implications - It is a pioneering, preliminary study. Future research with outcomes-based data from project managers using Tai Chi recommended. Originality/value - The integration of Eastern and Western philosophies into a framework for team project and knowledge management was shown to support cohesive strategies, improve soft skills, and strengthen decision making.","[Swain, Deborah Elizabeth] NC Cent Univ, Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Durham, NC USA; [Lightfoot, James Earl] Creat Human Interface, Tampa, FL USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina Central University,"Swain, DE (corresponding author), NC Cent Univ, Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Durham, NC USA.",dswain@nccu.edu,,,,,,,51,6,12,6,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to present results of the research of teamwork during which members were working together with online management tools in the platform of TransistorsHead.com on the given project. The online tools played also a role of research tools in order to record 10 managerial actions taken in that project. The results of the research show how it is possible to track, record and use human managerial actions to implement an artificial manager in a team. Methods: In the research a long-term, non-participating observation was used. The observation tool a few weeks and the managerial actions were being recorded by online management tools. Findings & Value added: The papers presents results of research which is a part of a solution of the main scientific problem which has to be solved in a way to artificial management. This scientific problem is what human team managers really do in their teamwork and in cooperation with their team members. All traditional research methods such as questionnaires and interviews give quite poor results. The non-participating, long-term observation of the teamwork together with online tools provide true knowledge which can be used in artificial management.","[Flak, Olaf] Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Management Inst, Fac Law & Social Sci, Stefana Zeromskiego 5, PL-25369 Kielce, Poland",Jan Kochanowski University,"Flak, O (corresponding author), Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Management Inst, Fac Law & Social Sci, Stefana Zeromskiego 5, PL-25369 Kielce, Poland.",ja@olafflak.com,,,[NCN 2020/39/G/HS6/02124],,Scientific Paper was elaborated within the framework of the project Team Flow and Team Effectiveness in Virtual Teams and was fully funded by a grant (NCN 2020/39/G/HS6/02124).,,33,0,0,0,0,UNIV PRESOV,PRESOV,"17 NOVEMBRA 15, PRESOV, 080 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-555-3215-8,,,,2023,,,,,,,384,394,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BX1PZ,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001250452400043,View Full Record in Web of Science

The system enables digitalization and intelligentization of purchasing plans, reconciliations, and consumption settlements while generating purchase, sales, inventory reports as well as various query reports. The indicators for evaluating the effectiveness before and after project implementation encompass drug loss reporting, inventory discrepancies, inter-hospital medication retrieval frequency, drug expenditure, and cloud pharmacy service utilization.Results The successful implementation of this system has reduced the hospital inventory rate to approximately 20% and decreased the average annual inventory error rate from 0.425 parts per thousand to 0.025 parts per thousand, significantly boosting drug supply chain efficiency by 42.4%. It has also minimized errors in drug application, allocation, and distribution while increasing adverse reaction reports. Drug management across multiple hospital districts has been standardized, leading to improved access to medicines and enhanced patient satisfaction.Conclusion The AI+VMI system improves drug supply chain management by ensuring security, reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and safety of drug management, and elevating the professional competence and service level of pharmaceutical personnel.","[Shen, Jianwen; Bu, Fengjiao; Zhang, Min; Ma, Qin; Yan, Jingchao; Huang, Taomin] Fudan Univ, Eye & ENT Hosp, Dept Pharm, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhengqiang] Fudan Univ, Eye & ENT Hosp, Informat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Yan, JC; Huang, TM (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Eye & ENT Hosp, Dept Pharm, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jingchao.yan@fdeent.org; taomin.huang@fdeent.org,"Zhang, Ming-Zhi/AAI-6131-2020","yan, jingchao/0000-0002-5689-9989",Fudan University Hospital Management Construction Project [FDYGC20230105]; Shanghai Municipal Health Commission [202140069]; Young Clinical Scientist Training Program at Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University,Fudan University Hospital Management Construction Project; Shanghai Municipal Health Commission; Young Clinical Scientist Training Program at Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This study aims to introduce the platform model and ecosystem thinking to the development of AI-enabled smart buildings. The study identifies the needs for a user-oriented digital service ecosystem and business model in the smart building sector in Finland, which aimed to facilitate the launch of scalable businesses and an experiential and dynamic business ecosystem. A multi-method, interpretive case study was applied in the focal ecosystem, with the leading real estate and facility management operators in Northern Europe as part of a Finnish national innovation project. Our results propose an extended comprehensive framework of the 5C ecosystemic model (Connection, Content, Computation, Context, and Commerce) and the possible paths of ecosystem players in the domain of smart building and smart built environment, both theoretically and empirically. The platform-oriented business models are missing, yet desired, by the ecosystem actors. The value chain and ecosystem platforms imply the quest for new (platform) models. Finally, our research discusses the need for new value-chain- and ecosystem-oriented AI development and big data platforms in the future.","[Xu, Yuegiang; Ahokangas, Petri] Univ Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Turunen, Marja; Mantymaki, Matti; Heikkila, Jukka] Univ Turku, Informat Syst Sci, Turku Sch Econ, SF-20500 Turku, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Turku,"Xu, YA (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, Oulu 90014, Finland.",yueqiang.xu@oulu.fi; petri.ahokangas@oulu.fi; marja.turunen@utu.fi; matti.mantymaki@utu.fi; jups@utu.fi,"Ahokangas, Petri/AAH-9632-2021; Heikkilä, Jukka-Pekka/N-6632-2015; Turunen, Marja/C-1653-2013","Mantymaki, Matti/0000-0002-1981-566X; Turunen, Marja/0000-0003-2681-7329; Ahokangas, Petri/0000-0002-2351-8473","Business Finland (Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development), the VirpaD project","Business Finland (Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development), the VirpaD project","This research is funded by Business Finland (the Finnish public funding agency for research and technology development), the VirpaD project.",,105,13,13,13,118,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,OCT,2019,8,10,,,,,,,1150,10.3390/electronics8101150,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8101150,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,JP4UW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000498262700090,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper briefly reviews the development of CLEAR and proposes an intelligent knowledge transference process of information on NCDOT projects using natural language processing and knowledge graphs based on neural language models developed by the CLEAR project team. The CLEAR project includes a collection of documented lessons learned and best practices. The AI model learns an inference model of the domain vocabulary from various sources such as contract documents, textbooks, and specifications. This model allows the system to make meaningful connections between lessons learned and best practices within CLEAR and the project-specific domain knowledge. The model output will initially be shown to NCDOT team members belonging to various project life cycle phases such as design, construction, and maintenance to certify the usefulness of the generated keywords and thereby the AI model in an iterative manner until the model has been appropriately fine-tuned. Necessary modifications will be made to the model based on the feedback obtained from project personnel to ensure high-quality output. In the long run, this automation in information retrieval will encourage NCDOT personnel to use the CLEAR program as a part of their routine work to improve project workflow processes.","[Banerjee, Siddharth; Jaselskis, Edward J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC USA; [Jhala, Arnav H.; Jaselskis, Edward J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Banerjee, S (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC USA.",sbaner22@ncsu.edu; cmpotts@ncsu.edu; ahjhala@ncsu.edu; ejjasels@ncsu.edu,"Banerjee, Siddharth/AAD-3624-2021",,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8389-3,,,,2022,,,,,,,779,786,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BU8LH,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000948933100096,View Full Record in Web of Science

Organisations around the world are investing in implementing AI systems to improve their supply chain and become more resilient to pandemics and disruption. At the same time, practitioners are not fully aware of the factors that impact the implementation of these systems. Alongside this, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive study that evaluates the enablers impacting the implementation of AI in production systems. This research fills this gap by identifying, defining, and evaluating the critical enablers influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in production systems. We extracted twelve enablers, created a conceptual model, and categorised the enablers based on the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework. After categorisation, we used the analytical hierarchy process to assess the importance of the enablers presented in the model using data collected from eight experts. The results revealed that technology, as a category, is more crucial than organisation or environment. The findings also indicated that project management is the most critical of all twelve enablers. We discuss the implications of the analysis for practitioners and researchers. We also offer twelve propositions that researchers can empirically assess in future studies.","[Merhi, Mohammad I.] Indiana Univ South Bend, Judd Leighton Sch Business & Econ, Dept Decis Sci, South Bend, IN 46615 USA; [Harfouche, Antoine] Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France",Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend,"Merhi, MI (corresponding author), Indiana Univ South Bend, Judd Leighton Sch Business & Econ, Dept Decis Sci, South Bend, IN 46615 USA.",mmerhi@iusb.edu,"Harfouche, Antoine/ABD-3392-2022","Merhi, Mohammad/0000-0003-2933-1965; Harfouche, Antoine/0000-0002-0407-9217",,,,,85,38,39,35,131,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The failure of energy policies can have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences when policies do not meet the energy and climate goals throughout the lifecycle of the policy. Such shortcomings are reported to be due to inadequate incentives and poor decision making that needs to promote fairness, equality, equity, and inclusiveness in energy policies and project decision making. The integration of AI in energy sectors poses various challenges that this study aims to analyze through a comprehensive examination of energy policy processes. The study focuses on (1) the decision-making process during the development stage, (2) the implementation management process for the execution stage, (3) the integration of data science, machine learning, and deep learning in energy systems, and (4) the requirements of energy systems in the context of substantiality. Synergistically, an emerging blueprint of policy, data science and AI, engineering practices, management process, business models, and social approaches that provides a multilateral design and implementation reference is propounded. Finally, a novel framework is developed to develop and implement modern energy policies that minimize risks, promote successful implementation, and advance society's journey towards net zero and carbon neutral objectives.","[Danish, Mir Sayed Shah; Senjyu, Tomonobu] Univ Ryukyus, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 1 Senbaru, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Danish, Mir Sayed Shah] Nagoya Univ, IMaSS Inst Mat & Syst Sustainabil, Energy Syst Chubu Elect Power Funded Res Div, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Danish, MSS (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 1 Senbaru, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.;Danish, MSS (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, IMaSS Inst Mat & Syst Sustainabil, Energy Syst Chubu Elect Power Funded Res Div, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",danish@mdanish.me,"SENJYU, TOMONOBU/AAN-2996-2020; DANISH, Mir Sayed Shah/E-9977-2014","SENJYU, TOMONOBU/0000-0003-4494-6773; DANISH, Mir Sayed Shah/0000-0002-5196-2280",,,,,52,14,14,11,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY 6,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7643,10.3390/su15097643,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097643,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,G3JF1,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000988152300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The application of artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in the establishment of digital archives in the society 5.0. The exponential growth of digital content, combined with the continent's diverse cultural landscape, presents complex obstacles to conventional archival practices. Without the effective implementation of artificial intelligence technologies, crucial aspects such as curation, accessibility and sustainable management of audiovisual archives in Africa remain hindered. Thus, the overarching problem under scrutiny pertains to how the establishment of intelligent archives, facilitated by AI, can offer innovative solutions for preserving and managing audiovisual archives in Africa, within the overarching framework of Society 5.0. This approach has the potential to significantly contribute to safeguarding Africa's rich cultural heritage and advancing research, education and cultural exchange. The purpose of this paper will be to focus on the challenges encountered by selected African countries, such as the ESARBICA countries and those that undertake environmental conservation projects, in managing their audiovisual collections and what can be done to facilitate AI. It resulted in the formulation of a framework for implementing smart archives using AI in African contexts, emphasizing practical strategies and best practices. A qualitative approach enabled a nuanced understanding of complex dynamics at play. Through the observation of AI integration processes, by means of desktop analyses of websites of African national archives and online interest groups showcasing nature conservation projects and initiatives, this article aims to capture a comprehensive picture of the current landscape and future possibilities.","[Schellnack-Kelly, Isabel] UNISA, Dept Informat Sci, POB 392, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Modiba, Mashilo] Univ South Africa, Dept Informat Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of South Africa,"Schellnack-Kelly, I (corresponding author), UNISA, Dept Informat Sci, POB 392, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",schelis@unisa.ac.za,,"Modiba, Mashilo/0000-0003-2843-0056",University of South Africa,University of South Africa,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The funding is from the University of South Africa.",,48,0,0,34,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0266-6669,1741-6469,,INFORM DEV,Inf.

Despite the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve health and safety management, their adoption in the Ghanaian construction industry remains limited. This paper aims to identify and evaluate key factors influencing the uptake of AI technologies in construction health and safety management within the Ghanaian industry.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopts a rigorous two-step qualitative approach to identify a set of 17 variables. First, an extensive analysis of scholarly publications was conducted to compile an initial variable list. Secondly, a pilot survey involving both academic and industry professionals assisted in refining the identified variables. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey involving 219 Ghanaian construction professionals then collects quantitative assessments of each variable using the purposive sampling technique. Statistical modelling using factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) was applied to process the survey data and determine the criticality of the factor categories.FindingsThe factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution underlying the 17 adoption variables: Extensive technological requirements and costs, resistance to change and AI adoption and uncertainty about AI outcomes and value. Subsequently, FSE confirmation showed the Extensive Technological Requirements category as the most critical, with specialized algorithmic demands, infrastructure limitations and expert support needs presenting major obstacles Ghanaian firms face in AI adoption.Originality/valueThis research contributes robust empirical evidence and novel factor-based statistical analysis to augment the theoretical discourse surrounding construction safety technology integration and change dynamics. The developed fuzzy quantitative methodology offers a model for assessing complex innovation adoption decisions in the face of uncertainty. The research addresses a gap in existing literature by providing a comprehensive assessment of the technological, organizational and environmental factors shaping AI adoption decisions and offering practical strategies for overcoming adoption barriers.","[Acheampong, Alex; Adjei, Elvis Konadu; Atibila, David Wireko; Abu, Ivy Maame] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Adjei, Elvis Konadu] Colorado State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Asiedu, Richard Ohene] Koforidua Tech Univ, Dept Bldg Technol, Koforidua, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins,"Atibila, DW (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",aacheampong.cap@knust.edu.gh; elvis.adjei@colostate.edu; richasiedu35@gmail.com; wirekodavid73@gmail.com; ivy.abu@gmail.com,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1726-0531,,,J ENG DES TECHNOL,J.

Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), research into the history of cybernetics, artificial intelligence (AI), and policy studies, it argues that the ongoing digital transformation and the expansion of the algorithmic public sphere does not solve but amplifies the problem of cultural participation, challenging the 'participatory turn' in cultural policy, defined as cultural policy's re-orientation to encourage participation of different stakeholders at different stages of policymaking. This process is analysed through two cases: the postponing of a retrospective exhibition of the painter Philip Guston in the United States and the pre-emptive ban of a public art project centred on a monument for the Soviet Lithuanian writer Petras Cvirka in Lithuania. In both cases, risk management through pre-emption backfired and revealed the lack of institutional preparedness to foresee and deal with the digital social.","[Rindzeviciute, Egle] Kingston Univ London, Dept Criminol Polit & Sociol, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Rindzeviciute, E (corresponding author), Kingston Univ London, Dept Criminol Polit & Sociol, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",e.rindzeviciute@kingston.ac.uk,"Rindzeviciute, Egle/J-8062-2019","Rindzeviciute, Egle/0000-0002-1050-4873",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/W000253/1]; AHRC [AH/W000253/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),The work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/W000253/1].,,108,4,4,8,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6632,1477-2833,,INT J CULT POLICY,Int.

Previous studies have mainly provided Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical models to predict the overall risk of IS/IT project portfolio, whereas neuro-fuzzy models were rarely used. This paper proposes a Sugeno Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model based on Fuzzy Factor Analysis (FFA) named ANFIS-OPR to predict the overall risk of IS/IT project portfolio from historical IS/IT project risk data. The ANFIS-OPR inputs are the relevant factor loadings resulting from the FFA application on the IS/ IT projects risks set to cope with the curse of dimensionality. Then, the Sugeno ANFIS model is adopted to give strategic interpretability to the predicted IS/IT project portfolio overall risk by implementing the IS/IT Project Management Office (PMO) expert knowledge, represented by fuzzy rules, on the relationship between IS/IT project portfolio strategic alignment and the IS/IT projects risks. The ANFISOPR outputs are the predicted Overall Portfolio Risk (OPR) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The paper also presents an IS/ IT PMO case study that shows the proposed ANFIS-OPR efficacy, which predicted the OPR values closely to the OPR estimates with an accepted RMSE of 0.108. The proposed ANFIS-OPR is a novel intelligent decision -making tool that enables the IS/IT PMO to monitor the OPR, considering its linkage with strategic alignment; thus, contingency plans can be carried out appropriately while ensuring that the IS/IT project portfolio is strategically aligned.","[Zaidouni, Anass; Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou Janati; Bellabdaoui, Adil] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Zaidouni, A (corresponding author), Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco.",anass_zaidouni@um5.ac.ma; abdou.janati@ensias.um5.ac.ma; adil.bellabdaoui@ensias.um5.ac.ma,,,,,,,62,2,2,5,7,UNIV UTARA MALAYSIA PRESS,SINTOK,"UNIV UTARA MALAYSIA PRESS, SINTOK, KEDAH 06010, MALAYSIA",1675-414X,2180-3862,,J INF COMMUN TECHNOL,J.

Natural Language Processing provides various tools for word frequencies, but also topic modelling, allowing to track the relevance of topics over time in the media or in the literature. In collaboration with University of Technology linguistics, we intend to provide a corpus of classical English and German literature, as well as the option of uploading your own corpus which can be obtained from webscraping or other sources. A team of students of the vocational high school TGM Wien specialised in IT and Software Development is working on the design of the interactive GUI for this NLP application, learning in this way the methods of Natural Language Processing and Artrificial Intelligence in a project based setting. For this the statistical programming language R is utilized which already provides packages with implementation for Natural Language Processing and in addition the shiny package which allows to develop interactie web apps without additional web and app programming. A team of teachers supervises and supports the students during the development process, providing expertise in AI and NLP, in web and app programming, as well as server management. Two intended outcomes exist. Ont the one hand, we want our students to learn Natural Language Processing first hand through development of this application. On the other hand, we intend to obtain an interactive AI tool which can assist language teachers and their students on the long term in the classroom. In times of GPT3 and GPT4 dominating the media and perception of Artificial Intelligence, we intend to teach students about the methodology involved first hand by having them participate in the development of such an interactive application for Natural Language Processing. Through a project based learning approach, we involve them in all steps of the development over a times of one and a half years, two school years. The final product of this project is an interactive web application for topic modelling and visualising word frequency counts in various ways.","[Posekany, Alexandra] TU Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Posekany, Alexandra; Dolezal, Dominik] TGM Vienna Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Dolezal, Dominik] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Posekany, A (corresponding author), TU Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria.;Posekany, A (corresponding author), TGM Vienna Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria.",aposekany@tgm.ac.at,"Dolezal, Dominik/ABA-3043-2021","Dolezal, Dominik/0000-0002-0125-4817",Austrian Ministry of Education,Austrian Ministry of Education,"We thank foremost our students for their active and highly motivated work on the project.

However, the application of AI approaches did not reach the peak of its potential due to the inappropriate handling of missing data and the omission of state-of-the-art techniques. In the present contribution, we proposed a hybrid method for the improved stability prediction of construction projects based on individual machine learning (ML) algorithms, input missing data imputation, semi-supervised learning and the classifier ensemble. Seven ML algorithms were selected to build individual classifiers for the classifier ensemble. 5-fold cross validation was used as the validation method and the performance measures were chosen to be the confusion matrix, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under ROC curve (AUC). Exhaustive grid search and firefly algorithm were used for hyper-parameters and weights tuning respectively. The capability of the proposed method was verified using an underground construction dataset, the stope hangingwall (HW) dataset. The case study shows that the input missing data imputation and semi-supervised learning improved the predictive performance of ML algorithms on HW stability prediction. The highest and average AUC values on the testing set were increased to 0.954 and 0.923 respectively on the expanded dataset, compared with 0.879 and 0.860 on the original complete dataset. Further improvement was obtained through the classifier ensemble, with the AUC value being increased to 0.976. Harnessing such method extends recent efforts for stability prediction in construction projects, and can significantly accelerate the project design and stability management. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the most prominent topics addressed by national AI policies, as well as their relative importance across nations. This paper integrates the results of a topic modeling analysis of 30 national AI policies with a qualitative content analysis of the policies. Based on this analysis, fourteen main common themes have been identified among national AI policies, which predominantly relate to educational, technological, government, ethical/legal, and social good concerns. Following this, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of topics across countries to determine the extent of topic prioritization in each country. In this investigation, several marginalized AI policy topics were also identified. In general, the challenges and concerns of the majority of policies pertain to education, technology, and the government. Governments refer to real-world projects and investments in AI technologies without developing shared digital governance platforms that promote responsible and sustainable AI among technology titans and mitigate the negative effects of surveillance capitalism. Although governments acknowledge the ethical and legal aspects of AI development and frequently cite the GDPR, they limit their discussion to the data level, particularly data sharing, and marginalize ethical algorithms and other phases of data and AI management and design. In addition, government policies marginalize AI startups and the API economy, even though they play a crucial role in fostering the AI ecosystem. The paper contributes to the existing literature on AI policy and will serve as a guide for AI policymakers to help them better understand the topical similarities across countries and the neglected or marginalized challenges that require further attention.","[Saheb, Tahereh] Menlo Coll, Atherton, CA 94027 USA; [Saheb, Tayebeh] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Law, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Saheb, T (corresponding author), Menlo Coll, Atherton, CA 94027 USA.;Saheb, T (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Law, Tehran, Iran.",tahereh.saheb@menlo.edu; t-saheb@modares.ac.ir,"Saheb, Tayebeh/ABY-9272-2022","Saheb, Tahereh/0000-0002-6426-609X",,,,,63,24,24,39,133,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

In 2024, about 310,720 women in the U.S. are projected to receive an invasive breast cancer diagnosis, alongside 56,500 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life. About 65% of women with the BRCA1 and 45% with the BRCA2 gene variants develop breast cancer by age 70. While these genes account for 5% of breast cancers, their prevalence is higher in certain populations. Advances in early detection, personalised medicine, and AI-driven diagnostics are improving outcomes by enabling a more precise analysis, reducing recurrence, and minimising treatment side effects. Our paper aims to explore the vast applications of artificial intelligence within the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and how these advancements can contribute to elevating patient care as well as discussing the potential drawbacks of such integrations into modern medicine. We structured our paper as a non-systematic review and utilised Google Scholar and PubMed databases to review literature regarding the incorporation of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of non-palpable breast masses. AI is revolutionising breast cancer management by enhancing imaging, pathology, and personalised treatment. In imaging, AI can improve the detection of cancer in mammography, MRIs, and ultrasounds, rivalling expert radiologists in accuracy. In pathology, AI enhances biomarker detection, improving HER2 and Ki67 assessments. Personalised medicine benefits from AI's predictive power, aiding risk stratification and treatment response. AI also shows promise in triple-negative breast cancer management, offering better prognosis and subtype classification. However, challenges include data variability, ethical concerns, and real-world validation. Despite limitations, AI integration offers significant potential in improving breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes.","[Uchikov, Petar] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Med, Dept Special Surg, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria; [Khalid, Usman; Dedaj-Salad, Granit Harris; Ghale, Dibya; Rajadurai, Harney] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Med, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria; [Kraeva, Maria; Markov, Stoyan] Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Fac, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria; [Kraev, Krasimir] Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Fac, Dept Propedeut Internal Dis, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria; [Hristov, Bozhidar] Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Fac, Dept Internal Dis 2, Sect Gastroenterol, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria; [Doykov, Mladen] Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Fac, Dept Urol & Gen Med, Plovdiv 4001, Bulgaria; [Mitova, Vanya] Univ Specialized Hosp Act Oncol Treatment Prof Iva, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria; [Bozhkova, Maria] Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Coll, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria; [Stanchev, Pavel] Med Univ Plovdiv, St George Univ Hosp, Clin Endocrinol & Metab Dis, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria",Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv; Medical University Plovdiv,"Kraev, K (corresponding author), Med Univ Plovdiv, Med Fac, Dept Propedeut Internal Dis, Plovdiv 4002, Bulgaria.",puchikov@yahoo.com; usmankhalid957@gmail.com; ghds2000@gmail.com; ghaledibya@gmail.com; harney06@gmail.com; kraevamaria93@gmail.com; kkraev@hotmail.com; hristov.bozhidar@abv.bg; mladen.doykov@mu-plovdiv.bg; vania_mitova@mail.bg; mariya.bozhkova@mu-plovdiv.bg; stoyan_bgus2002@yahoo.com; pavel.stanchev@mu-plovdiv.bg,"Kraev, Krasimir/AAU-7544-2020","Kraev, Krasimir/0000-0002-1155-117X; Markov, Stoan/0000-0002-3491-1377; Khalid, Usman/0009-0004-9425-2539",,,,,51,4,4,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1729,,LIFE-BASEL,Life-Basel,NOV,2024,14,11,,,,,,,1451,10.3390/life14111451,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life14111451,,,17,Biology; Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Microbiology,N6E9Y,39598249,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001365261200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the openness and dependence of AI models on massive volumes of data render them subject to serious security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks. This study investigates security issues in O-RAN's near real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation. We introduce a novel attack manipulating environmental observations to mislead AI agents, resulting in erroneous allocations and decreased physical resource block (PRB) transmission rates for various vehicular communications. We also discover flaws where compromised users or signal jammers can fake signal power to trick the AI agent's state observation. This can lead to a policy infiltration attack that makes the network performance drop significantly. Evaluation results show up to a 40% decline in user data rates, a 77.74% reduction in packet delivery rates, and significant disruptions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) services such as remote driving and connected automated vehicles. The policy infiltration attack causes a 20% increase in packet losses and up to 150% delay overall. The attack efficiency emphasizes the need for adversarial training in protecting AI-driven applications, which should be addressed in future O-RAN security specifications and AI-powered vehicular networks.","[Ergu, Yared Abera; Nguyen, Van-Linh] Natl Chung Cheng Univ CCU, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Minhsiung 621301, Taiwan; [Nguyen, Van-Linh] Natl Chung Cheng Univ CCU, Adv Inst Mfg High TechInnovat, Minhsiung 621301, Taiwan; [Hwang, Ren-Hung; Lin, Ying-Dar] Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ NYCU, Tainan, Taiwan; [Cho, Chuan-Yu; Yang, Hui-Kuo] Ind Technol Res Inst, Hsinchu 310401, Taiwan; [Shin, Hyundong] Kyung Hee Univ, Yongin 17104, South Korea; [Duong, Trung Q.] Mem Univ, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Duong, Trung Q.] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan; Kyung Hee University; Memorial University Newfoundland; Queens University Belfast,"Nguyen, V (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ CCU, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Minhsiung 621301, Taiwan.;Nguyen, V (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ CCU, Adv Inst Mfg High TechInnovat, Minhsiung 621301, Taiwan.",yared111p@cs.ccu.edu.tw; nvlinh@cs.ccu.edu.tw; rhhwang@nycu.edu.tw; ydlin@nycu.edu.tw; ares@itri.org.tw; hgyang@itri.org.tw; hshin@khu.ac.kr; tduong@mun.ca,"Duong, Trung Q./AAI-6708-2020; Ergu, Yared/LEM-9489-2024; Hwang, Ren-Hung/M-8613-2018; Duong, Trung Q./I-1291-2013; Nguyen, Van-Linh/L-6234-2018","Abera Ergu, Yared/0000-0002-1807-7909; Hwang, Ren-Hung/0000-0001-7996-4184; Shin, Hyundong/0000-0003-3364-8084; Lin, Ying-Dar/0000-0002-5226-4396; Duong, Trung Q./0000-0002-4703-4836; Nguyen, Van-Linh/0000-0002-3472-0108","National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan [111-2222-E-194-007-MY2, 112-2221-E-194-017-MY3]; Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Taiwan",National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan; Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Taiwan,"This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan under Grant 111-2222-E-194-007-MY2 and Grant 112-2221-E-194-017-MY3, and in part by the Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Taiwan.",,41,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9545,1939-9359,,IEEE T VEH TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

The k-Nearest Neighbour method is employed as a predictor and to reduce the size of a training set containing more similar observations. An Artificial Intelligence (Al) method then makes use of the reduced training set to predict the real duration of a project. Additionally, we report on the forecasting stability of the various Al methods and their hybrid Nearest Neighbour counterparts. A large computer experiment is set up to assess the forecasting accuracy and stability of the existing and newly proposed methods. The experiments indicate that the Nearest Neighbour technique yields the best stability results and is able to improve the AI methods when the training set is similar or not equal to the test set. Sensitivity checks vary the amount of historical data and number of neighbours, leading to the conclusion that having more historical data, from which the a relevant subset can be selected by means of the proposed Nearest Neighbour technique, is preferential.

However, the adoption rates and attitudes towards AI across European laboratories have not been comprehensively analyzed. This study aims to fill this gap by surveying European laboratory professionals to assess their current use of AI, the digital infrastructure available, and their attitudes towards future implementations.Methods We conducted a methodical survey during October 2023, distributed via EFLM mailing lists. The survey explored six key areas: general characteristics, digital equipment, access to health data, data management, AI advancements, and personal perspectives. We analyzed responses to quantify AI integration and identify barriers to its adoption.Results From 426 initial responses, 195 were considered after excluding incomplete and non-European entries. The findings revealed limited AI engagement, with significant gaps in necessary digital infrastructure and training. Only 25.6 % of laboratories reported ongoing AI projects. Major barriers included inadequate digital tools, restricted access to comprehensive data, and a lack of AI-related skills among personnel. Notably, a substantial interest in AI training was expressed, indicating a demand for educational initiatives.Conclusions Despite the recognized potential of AI to revolutionize laboratory medicine by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, European laboratories face substantial challenges. This survey highlights a critical need for strategic investments in educational programs and infrastructure improvements to support AI integration in laboratory medicine across Europe. Future efforts should focus on enhancing data accessibility, upgrading technological tools, and expanding AI training and literacy among professionals. In response, our working group plans to develop and make available online training materials to meet this growing educational demand.","[Cadamuro, Janne] Paracelsus Med Univ Salzburg, Dept Lab Med, Mullner Haupt Str 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Carobene, Anna] IRCCS San Raffaele Sci Inst, Lab Med, Milan, Italy; [Cabitza, Federico] Univ Milano Bicocca, DISCo, Milan, Italy; [Cabitza, Federico] IRCCS Osped Galeazzi St Ambrogio, Milan, Italy; [Debeljak, Zeljko] Univ Hosp Ctr Osijek, Clin Inst Lab Diag, Osijek, Croatia; [Debeljak, Zeljko] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Pharmacol, Osijek, Croatia; [De Bruyne, Sander] Univ Ghent, Dept Diag Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [De Bruyne, Sander] AZ Sint Blasius, Dept Lab Med, Dendermonde, Belgium; [van Doorn, William] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Chem, Cent Diag Lab, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Johannes, Elias] MDI Limbach Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Johannes, Elias] HMU Hlth & Med Univ GmbH, Potsdam, Germany; [Frans, Glynis] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Transplantat, Leuven, Belgium; [Ozdemir, Habib] Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, Manisa, Turkiye; [Ozdemir, Habib] Turkiye Inst Hlth, Turkiye Hlth Data Res & Artificial Intelligence Ap, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Perez, Salomon] Virgen Macarena Univ Hosp, Lab Med Dept, Seville, Spain; [Rajdl, Daniel] Charles Univ Prague, Med Fac Pilsen, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Tolios, Alexander] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Transfus Med & Cell Therapy, Vienna, Austria; [Padoan, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Med DIMED, Padua, Italy; [Padoan, Andrea] Univ Hosp Padova, Padua, Italy",Paracelsus Private Medical University; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; Ghent University; Maastricht University; KU Leuven; Celal Bayar University; Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena; Charles University Prague; Medical University of Vienna; University of Padua; University of Padua; Azienda Ospedaliera - Universita di Padova,"Cadamuro, J (corresponding author), Paracelsus Med Univ Salzburg, Dept Lab Med, Mullner Haupt Str 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",j.cadamuro@salk.at,"ÖZDEMİR, Habib/JWA-5483-2024; Carobene, Anna/D-2240-2018; Martín Pérez, Salomón/GQP-2332-2022; Cabitza, Federico/JCO-4001-2023; Padoan, Andrea/J-7869-2016; De Bruyne, Sander/HPC-1634-2023","OZDEMIR, Habib/0000-0002-1267-7233; Frans, Glynis/0000-0001-8528-5719; Martin Perez, Salomon/0000-0002-2086-3597",,,,,31,7,7,7,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1434-6621,1437-4331,,CLIN CHEM LAB MED,Clin.

It reviews current AI regulation and governance frameworks to provide insights for stakeholders navigating AI integration. A descriptive analysis based on a literature review of recent research is conducted, exploring AI applications, benefits, challenges, regulations, and relevant theories. This study identifies key trends and suggests future research directions. The major findings include an overview of AI applications, benefits, challenges, and ethical issues in the banking and finance industries. Recommendations are provided to address these challenges and ethical issues, along with examples of existing regulations and strategies for implementing AI governance frameworks within organizations. This paper highlights innovation, regulation, and ethical issues in relation to AI within the banking and finance sectors. Analyzes the previous literature, and suggests strategies for AI governance framework implementation and future research directions. Innovation in the applications of AI integrates with fintech, such as preventing financial crimes, credit risk assessment, customer service, and investment management. These applications improve decision making and enhance the customer experience, particularly in banks. Existing AI regulations and guidelines include those from Hong Kong SAR, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Singapore. Challenges include data privacy and security, bias and fairness, accountability and transparency, and the skill gap. Therefore, implementing an AI governance framework requires rules and guidelines to address these issues. This paper makes recommendations for policymakers and suggests practical implications in reference to the ASEAN guidelines for AI development at the national and regional levels. Future research directions, a combination of extended UTAUT, change theory, and institutional theory, as well as the critical success factor, can fill the theoretical gap through mixed-method research. In terms of the population gap can be addressed by research undertaken in a nation where fintech services are projected to be less accepted, such as a developing or Islamic country. In summary, this study presents a novel approach using descriptive analysis, offering four main contributions that make this research novel: (1) the applications of AI in the banking and finance industries, (2) the benefits and challenges of AI adoption in these industries, (3) the current AI regulations and governance, and (4) the types of theories relevant for further research. The research findings are expected to contribute to policy and offer practical implications for fintech development in a country.","[Ridzuan, Nurhadhinah Nadiah; Masri, Masairol; Anshari, Muhammad] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Sch Business & Econ, Bandar Seri Begawan BE1410, Brunei; [Fitriyani, Norma Latif; Syafrudin, Muhammad] Sejong Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Data Sci, Seoul 05006, South Korea",University Brunei Darussalam; Sejong University,"Syafrudin, M (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Data Sci, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",23h1922@ubd.edu.bn; masairol.masri@ubd.edu.bn; anshari.ali@ubd.edu.bn; norma@sejong.ac.kr; udin@sejong.ac.kr,"Syafrudin, Muhammad/P-9657-2017; Fitriyani, Norma Latif/S-4105-2018; Anshari, Muhammad/N-5268-2017; Anshari, Muhammad/F-8232-2012","Fitriyani, Norma Latif/0000-0002-1133-3965; Syafrudin, Muhammad/0000-0002-5640-4413; Anshari, Muhammad/0000-0002-8160-6682",,,,,105,4,4,53,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,AUG,2024,15,8,,,,,,,432,10.3390/info15080432,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info15080432,,,30,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,E8S7Z,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001305650000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The expansion of low-cost and traditional carriers has expanded the traditional passenger-carrying services' reach, breadth, depth, and frequency. Because of the rising demand for highly skilled specialists in intelligent human systems, airline recruiters are under increasing pressure to discover novel methods to attract and communicate with potential applicants. The research project's purpose was to incorporate Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) into implementing, training, and managing intelligent human system integration for airline employees worldwide. The research team conducted a theoretical examination of the CBTA framework in the USA and Turkey and identified areas of interest in aviation training. Moreover, it advocated integrating the CBTA framework using Artificial Intelligence (AI) across worldwide aviation networks. During the development of the global CBTA framework, the authors analyzed the controlling elements and trends in the aviation industry to provide a global strategy for managing Human Systems Integration (HSI) change. Marques et al. (2023) proposed that aviation universities should prioritize quality over quantity, provide opportunities for continuing education, and encourage learning beyond the ab initio basic knowledge requirements (e.g., quality performance-based training pilot hours incorporating immersive technologies like Artificial Intelligence-AI or/and Simulated Air Traffic Control Environment-SATCE). Demand is affected by organizational culture, opposition to technological progress, and employment regulations. Purdue's SATT approach synthesizes the Lean Six Sigma (L6) strategy and the CBTA framework as an alternative to the commonly utilized method in many countries, which improves organizational change management. Turkish airlines' training case study, implementing Threat Error Management with Purdue SATT CBTA orientation, offers a global approach to cost-practical quality training. The outcomes of this parallel case study project suggest that, in addition to utilizing the suggested Lean Six Sigma Recruitment / CBTA procedure, the aviation industry should reevaluate its organizational culture and implement an integrated CBTA-AI strategy.","[Ziakkas, Dimitrios; Natakusuma, Hans C.] Purdue Univ, Sch Aviat & Transportat Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sarikaya, Ibrahim] Turkish Airlines Flight Training Ctr, TR-34153 Istanbul, Turkiye",Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Ziakkas, D (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Aviat & Transportat Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",dziakkas@purdue.edu,,"Ziakkas, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7421-2071; Pechlivanis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9156-392X",,,,,9,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-031-35388-8; 978-3-031-35389-5,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2023,14018,,,,,,188,199,,10.1007/978-3-031-35389-5_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-35389-5_14,,,12,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ergonomics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BX3ZC,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001286432800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large projects may have tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of requirements to be managed and fulfilled. Two main issues impede requirements analysis: tortuous requirements to be interpreted; and humans' very limited ability to concentrate on a specific task. It has therefore been recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to support designers' decision making in classifying and allocating NPP requirements into predefined classes. This paper presents our work on developing an AI-based requirements classifier utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine-learning (ML). In addition, the paper presents the integration of the classifier with the requirements management system. The focus is on the classification of nuclear power industry-specific requirements utilizing deep-learning-based NLP. Three classifiers are compared, and the corresponding results are presented. The results include predetermined requirement classes, manually gathered and classified data, a comparison of three models and their classification accuracies, microservice system architecture, and integration of the established classifier with the requirements management system. As the performance of the requirements classifier and related system has been successfully demonstrated, future AI-specific development and studies are suggested to focus on atomizing multiclass requirements, combining similar requirements into one, checking requirements syntax, and utilizing unsupervised learning for clustering. Furthermore, new and advantageous requirement classes and hierarchies are suggested for development while improving current datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.","[Myllynen, Santeri; Raunio, Tapani; Karell, Rasmus; Lahtinen, Jussi] FORTUM, Fortum Power & Heal Oy, POB 100,Keilalandentie 2-4, FIN-00048 Espo, Finland; [Suominen, Ilpo] Bitfactor Oy, Mikonkatu 4, Helsinki 00100, Finland",,"Myllynen, S (corresponding author), FORTUM, Fortum Power & Heal Oy, POB 100,Keilalandentie 2-4, FIN-00048 Espo, Finland.",santeri.myllynen@fortum.com; ilpo.suominen@bitfactor.li; tapani.e.raunio@fortum.com; rasmus.karell@fortum.com; jussi.lahlinen@fortum.com,,,,,,,60,1,1,2,11,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",2332-8983,2332-8975,,J NUCL ENG RADIAT SC,J.

The imperatives of the socialist project and its economic ramifications in the endgame of the Cold War left a distinct imprint on AI. The GDR adopted a pragmatic approach to AI, which this article examines. It highlights the various strands and applications of late socialist AI research, encompassing both everyday applications and advanced scientific endeavors. Moving beyond the prevailing focus on U.S. research within the military-industrial complex, this article situates AI research within the broader history of the GDR, Central, and Eastern Europe. This study employs methods from science and technology studies to analyze AI objects, particularly chess computers, as indicators of the proliferation of AI within the everyday practices of the GDR. Through a thorough examination of a widely circulated computer magazine, this overview illustrates the diverse range of AI applications in the GDR, spanning areas such as planning, industrial management, state administration, science, public health, and pervasive surveillance. In this context, high-tech solutions were deployed alongside decaying industrial infrastructure, while utopian visions of intelligent machines intersected with ideological exhaustion, and health care applications were juxtaposed with fleeing doctors. These ambivalences reflect the complex state of the GDR in late socialism. Nevertheless, researchers and engineers worked on prototypes for image recognition, language processing, automatic reasoning and basic AI technologies, including programming languages and specialized hardware.","[Schmitt, Martin] Tech Univ Darmstadt, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Schmitt, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",martin.schmitt@tu-darmstadt.de,,"Schmitt, Martin/0000-0002-0034-9304",,,,,68,0,0,3,8,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1058-6180,1934-1547,,IEEE ANN HIST COMPUT,IEEE Ann.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a new technology that uses human thinking to respond accordingly through computers and robots to assist human beings. Action recognition is an important research project that needs to be broken through in many industries, such as security system, martial arts instruction, and dance training. This paper aims to study a method for action recognition using AI technology and to build a sports training management information system. In this paper, a recognition model and related algorithms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) are proposed, and an intelligent sports training management information system is constructed. The system and the model are tested, the action recognition effect of 60 athletes in a university is tested, and the comparison with the traditional recognition algorithm is carried out. The results show that the CNN recognition accuracy test results used in this paper are generally more than 90%, while the traditional recognition accuracy rate is only about 75%, and the highest is not more than 86%; the training management information system of this paper takes about 15.7 s, and the maximum time is not more than 10 s, while the traditional recognition system takes about 15.7 s, which is about twice the time of the system in this paper. Therefore, it shows that the CNN recognition method in this paper has a significantly better effect on the recognition of athletes' movements, and the sports training management information system constructed in this paper is less time-consuming and faster and has certain feasibility.","[Cheng, Dali; Li, Min] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Phys Educ, Chongqing 412160, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hong] Xuanhua Middle Sch Yongchuan, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences,"Li, M (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Phys Educ, Chongqing 412160, Peoples R China.",19980006@cqwu.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,1,1,6,24,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1058-9244,1875-919X,,SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH,Sci.

Agile supports an early return of investment that supports circular reinvesting and makes the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, agile also presents some intrinsic issues due to its iterative approach. Project information requires an efficient record of the requirements, aims, governance not only for the investors, owners or users but also to keep evidence in future health and safety and other statutory compliance-related issues. In order to address the agile project management issues and address new safety regulations, this paper proposes a project information model (PIM) based on a distributed ledger technology (DLT) with a ranked procedure for the verification and validation (V&V) of data. Each V&V phase inserts a process of authenticity, data abstraction and analytics that adds value to the information founded on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). The underlying DLT consists of smart contracts embedded on a private Ethereum blockchain. This approach supports a decentralised approach in which every project stakeholder owns, manages and stores the data.

Despite their potential benefits,research on public attitudes toward health care chatbots is still limited. To effectively support individuals with long-term healthconditions like long COVID (or post-COVID-19 condition), it is crucial to understand their perspectives and preferencesregarding the use of AI chatbots. Objective: This study has two main objectives: (1) provide insights into AI chatbot acceptance among people with chronichealth conditions, particularly adults older than 55 years and (2) explore the perceptions of using AI chatbots for healthself-management and long COVID support. Methods: A web-based survey study was conducted between January and March 2023, specifically targeting individuals withdiabetes and other chronic conditions. This particular population was chosen due to their potential awareness and ability toself-manage their condition. The survey aimed to capture data at multiple intervals, taking into consideration the public launchof ChatGPT, which could have potentially impacted public opinions during the project timeline. The survey received 1310clicks and garnered 900 responses, resulting in a total of 888 usable data points. Results: Although past experience with chatbots (P<.001, 95% CI .110-.302) and online information seeking (P<.001, 95%CI .039-.084) are strong indicators of respondents' future adoption of health chatbots, they are in general skeptical or unsureabout the use of AI chatbots for health care purposes. Less than one-third of the respondents (n=203, 30.1%) indicated thatthey were likely to use a health chatbot in the next 12 months if available. Most were uncertain about a chatbot's capability toprovide accurate medical advice. However, people seemed more receptive to using voice-based chatbots for mental well-being,health data collection, and analysis. Half of the respondents with long COVID showed interest in using emotionally intelligentchatbots. Conclusions: AI hesitancy is not uniform across all health domains and user groups. Despite persistent AI hesitancy, thereare promising opportunities for chatbots to offer support for chronic conditions in areas of lifestyle enhancement and mentalwell-being, potentially through voice-based user interfaces.","[Wu, Philip Fei] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, England; [Summers, Charlotte; Panesar, Arjun; Kaura, Amit] DDM Hlth, Coventry, England; [Summers, Charlotte; Panesar, Arjun] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry, England; [Kaura, Amit] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, London, England; [Zhang, Li] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, Egham, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Warwick; Imperial College London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Wu, PF (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, England.",Philip.Wu@rhul.ac.uk,"Short, Charlotte-Eve/JEP-2511-2023; Summers, Charlotte/A-6973-2012","Summers, Charlotte/0000-0002-7269-2873; Panesar, Arjun/0000-0001-7050-9038; Kaura, Amit/0000-0002-6962-3199",,,This research was funded by Innovate UK Smart Grants (grant 10032047) .,,38,1,1,6,8,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",2292-9495,,,JMIR HUM FACTORS,JMIR Hum.

This study investigates the ability of an AI model to accurately identify the glottis in video laryngoscope images captured from a manikin. Tracheal intubation was conducted on a manikin using a bronchoscope with recording capabilities, and image data of the glottis was gathered for creating an AI model. Data preprocessing and annotation of the vocal cords, epiglottis, and glottis were performed, and human annotation of the vocal cords, epiglottis, and glottis was carried out. Based on the AI's determinations, anatomical structures were color -coded for identification. The recognition accuracy of the epiglottis and vocal cords recognized by the AI model was 0.9516, which was over 95%. The AI successfully marked the glottis, epiglottis, and vocal cords during the tracheal intubation process. These markings significantly aided in the visual identification of the respective structures with an accuracy of more than 95%.

We address two research questions: (1) are these models able to predict student ratings from the student textual feedback, and (2) can AI-powered SET eliminate the problems of the traditional SET based on Likert scale surveys. We test these NLP models on a new dataset of 12,386 university reviews from the UK and on 155 SET reviews from a university that agreed to run a pilot AI project. The trained NLP models exhibited high prediction accuracy, and they learnt two biases from humans, those of extreme responding and assigning higher ratings to less demanding courses. In the future, universities will likely adopt many AI-based tools that have proved successful in client management in other sectors. However, our results make a strong case against using AI as a black box for performativity purposes.

One might think that applying leading edge AI methods to large quantities of industrial data will automatically yield valuable results. In our experience there are many traditional obstacles that need to be removed, before the magic can happen [2]. For many use cases, data from various sources need to be integrated. For example, time series data stored in industrial Data Historians need to be labeled according to quality data stored in Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). The process data like setpoints and raw material characteristics need to be contextualized using the production data, e.g. production orders, raw material lots, from ERP systems. Although many companies are currently building up enterprise data lakes, the reality in many plants still is that data is locked in separate silos and a real-time data integration requires significant efforts. Building, automating and operating a large industrial plant requires major (traditional) engineering efforts and expertise. Data scientists usually have different backgrounds and often lack knowledge, for example in control systems engineering and process engineering. In addition, many important engineering artifacts like Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) and process design document are either not up to date or even unavailable at all. However, in order to define relevant use cases and design powerful AI solutions, quite a high level of both traditional engineering and data science know-how is required. This means that traditional plant experts need to closely cooperate with data science experts. In the long run, software tools like ABB Ability (TM) BatchInsight will be able to offer easy to use solutions for a broad class of use-cases, so that plant experts can use AI solutions without the need for additional consulting [3]. Many industrial AI methods work with time series data. A larger industrial plant like a refinery can have many tens of thousands different time series. In the best case a consistent hierarchical naming schema is available and for each time series a good description exists. In reality, it can be cumbersome to identify the best set of time series related to the use case at hand [1]. In addition, data quality needs to be ensured. For example, if sensors are not properly calibrated, using this data can destroy AI models. In one of our projects, a sensor was being replaced at a certain point in time and the measured value changed from power to current. For convenience and because of the typical time pressure during daily operation, the new value was stored in the old variable. Our AI methods identified this abrupt change in system behavior, however this finding had no value for the customer. Industrial plants and their subsystems have different operating states that often need to be clearly separated. For example, if a time interval where the plant was in fault condition is accidentally included to train a reference model, the quality of this model will degrade. In summary, various challenges exist in the application of industrial AI solutions. Our talk will provide our learnings in addressing these challenges and will help to ask the following five questions before starting an industrial AI project: Can we define a use case with sufficient business value? Are people both with domain expertise and with expertise in AI committed to the project? Will the communication between domain experts and AI experts be good enough? Is all required data available for the project in sufficient quantities? Is the quality of the data sufficient or are additional preparation and cleaning efforts required?","[Hollender, Martin; Tan, Ruomu] ABB Corp Res, Ladenburg, Germany; [Xu, Chaojun] ABB PAEN, Mannheim, Germany",ABB,"Hollender, M (corresponding author), ABB Corp Res, Ladenburg, Germany.",martin.hollender@de.abb.com; chaojun.xu@de.abb.com; ruomu.tan@de.abb.com,"Hollender, Martin/AAF-4304-2020","Tan, Ruomu/0000-0002-9151-7245",,,,,5,0,0,17,17,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0591-5,,,,2024,,,,,,,41,42,,10.1145/3644815.3644968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3644815.3644968,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX1TC,,Bronze,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001251227200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: The project provided four educational sessions and nine case conferences to health care providers at tribal clinics in Washington State and Alaska using videoconferencing with pain experts at the University of Washington. A cross-sectional, descriptive study design was used to survey the participating providers. Measures included satisfaction with the telehealth system and self-perceived competence in pain management. Results: Fifty-two providers from 11 sites attended the educational sessions. Ninety-three providers from 16 sites participated in the case conferences. Case conference participants scored significantly higher on perceived competence in treating pain compared with clinic providers who did not attend. Educational session participants and case conference participants both reported a high level of satisfaction with videoconferencing. Conclusions: Telehealth is a feasible and effective way to deliver cancer-related pain management education and increase competence among rural health care providers.

Many rice blast management approaches require know-how of experienced farmers or agronomists. Monitoring the farm for disease detection is labor intensive and time consuming. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), we are able to detect plant diseases more efficiently. Existing AI and IoT studies detect plant diseases by images or nonimage hyperspectral data, which require manual operations to obtain the photographs or data for analysis. Also, image detection typically is too late as rice blast may already spread to other plants. Based on an IoT platform for soil cultivation, we develop the RiceTalk project that utilizes nonimage IoT devices to detect rice blast. Unlike the image-based plant disease detection approaches, our agriculture sensors generate nonimage data that can be automatically trained and analyzed by the AI mechanism in real time. The beauty of RiceTalk is that the AI model is treated as an IoT device and is managed like other IoT devices. In this way, our approach significantly reduces the platform management cost to provide real-time training and predictions. We also propose an innovative spore germination mechanism as a new feature extraction model for agriculture. In the current implementation, the accuracy of the RiceTalk prediction on rice blast is 89.4%.","[Chen, Wen-Liang; Ng, Fung-Ling] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Bing; Liu, Chun-You] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan; [Lin, Yun-Wei] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Lin, YB (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan.",wenurea@gmail.com; liny@nctu.edu.tw; ngfungling9@gmail.com; chunyou@itri.org.tw; jyneda@gmail.com,"Lin, YI-Bing/AAM-5772-2021; TY, C/KXR-8865-2024",,"Ministry of Science and Technology [106N490, 107R491, 108-2221-E-009-047]; Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity from the Featured Areas Research Center Program Within the Framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan",Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity from the Featured Areas Research Center Program Within the Framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan,"This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant 106N490, Grant 107R491, and Grant 108-2221-E-009-047; and in part by the Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity from the Featured Areas Research Center Program Within the Framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.",,23,89,90,16,104,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,FEB,2020,7,2,,,,,1001,1010,,10.1109/JIOT.2019.2947624,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2947624,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KX6IB,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000521981800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prior to the development of IA as a field, anthropologists researched the complex relationships between cultural and technological change. They sought to guide the design and adoption of new technologies by understanding their social-cultural impacts. The interdisciplinary field of science, technology and society provided frameworks for forecasting and assessing the impacts of technological changes. These reflect the well-practiced approaches of SIA for projects, plans or policies. We therefore call for the proactive application of SIA in advance of AI developments, as well as during and after they occur. We acknowledge AI has a role to play by increasing the efficiency of IA research, including, potentially in the management and analysis or qualitative data for SIAs but raise concerns about how AI could degrade IA practice. Our principal concern, however, is for SIA to consider the impacts of specific AI technologies on people and communities.

Leveraging advanced sensor technologies, including soil moisture, float level, pH, and humidity sensors, the proposed system collects real-time data from agricultural lands and transmits it to a cloud-based platform. Additionally, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is employed to detect and classify crop diseases from images captured in the field. The system further estimates disease severity by analyzing affected and unaffected leaf regions, enabling targeted treatment with appropriate pesticide concentrations. By combining IoT sensor data with AI-driven disease management. The integrated system offers a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture.

Furthermore, HPC workflows oftentimes require specialized knowledge for the installation and management of software dependencies. Our group has been working on closing this gap, particularly focused in remotely sensed applications, by leveraging high performance computing containers to make code portable across environments. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a set of containers to both speed up and optimize the development of remotely sensed data applications.

The implementation of health and safety (H&S) technologies is one of the most important strategies to alleviate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry and help the industry adapt to the new normal. This study aims to evaluate the adoption of H&S technologies for pandemic management in the construction sector under the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with eighteen practitioners engaged from construction companies and technology firms were conducted to collect their views on the driving forces and issues of the adoption of H&S technologies for pandemic management in Chinese construction projects. The results reveal that the major H&S technologies used included the health quick response (QR) code system, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered fever monitoring, and site access control system. These technologies were reported to be effective in preventing the spread of the pandemic in workplaces. The findings of the study amplify that the pandemic may serve as an acceleration of the adoption of H&S technologies in the construction sector. Other technologies, such as building information modeling, drones, AI-based safety monitoring, and robotics, however, were seldom used in the studied projects. The interviewees addressed several problems regarding the implementation of these technologies. High costs of technologies, a lack of client support, and disruptions to the normal work process were the main hurdles of the adoption of these technologies. The results indicated that the external influence factor-the COVID-19 pandemic-could considerably drive the use of H&S technologies, whereas the internal influence factors-cost and compatibility of technology-might be the major barriers to technology adoption. To encourage the wider use of H&S technologies in construction, the government is recommended to support the technology transformation by granting financial subsidies for costs involved in innovation adoption. Project owners may consider investing substantially in H&S technologies that can strengthen their resilient and innovative ability to adapt to the post-COVID-19 landscape. The present results will be useful to industry stakeholders and researchers interested in developing H&S technologies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises.","[Yang, Yang; Chan, Albert P.

This is due, among other things, to the sheer amount of traffic that they are expected to support, the decentralized nature of the architectures and the services they run. In these future communication networks, orchestration and management mechanisms will be more complicated when compared to previous communication technologies, and centralized legacy solutions are expected to be limited in ensuring revenue for the infrastructure providers, the service providers and a good Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end users. In order to tackle the issues of orchestration and management, both academia and industry have provided state of the art contributions based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its integration into 5G/B5G networks. Among these, we can find advanced forms of traffic forecasting, admission control (for network slices and user service requests) solutions based on AI and decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper summarizes some of the AI-based solutions developed by the authors as contributions to the problems of orchestration and management in 5G/B5G networks developed within the framework of the MonB5G project. The contributions in this scope are: 1) SCHEMA, a distributed RL mechanism for Service Function Placement (SFC), 2) CATP, a Context-Aware Traffic Predictor, and 3) Pre-BAC, an admission control mechanisms that exploits advanced time-series forecasting.","[Garrido, Luis A.; Dalgkitsis, Anestis; Ramantas, Kostas] Iquadrat R&D Dept Iquadrat Informat, Barcelona, Spain; [Verikoukis, Christos] CERCA, Commun Technol Div, CTTC, Castelldefels, Spain",Centre Tecnologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya (CTTC),"Garrido, LA (corresponding author), Iquadrat R&D Dept Iquadrat Informat, Barcelona, Spain.",l.garrido@iquadrat.com; a.dalgkitsis@iquadrat.com; kramantas@iquadrat.com; cveri@cttc.es,,,AGAUR [2017-SGR-891]; SPOT5G [TEC2017-87456-P]; MonB5G [871780],AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); SPOT5G; MonB5G,"This work was supported by research projects AGAUR (2017-SGR-891), SPOT5G (TEC2017-87456-P) and MonB5G (871780).",,51,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-4505-4,,,,2021,,,,,,,23,28,,10.1109/MeditCom49071.2021.9647571,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MeditCom49071.2021.9647571,,,6,Telecommunications,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Telecommunications,BT8DG,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000852833400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

AI-driven tools, such as parametric design and AI-assisted design methods, are already helping architects optimize layouts, reduce material waste, and create energy-efficient structures. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to streamline construction processes, provide predictive analytics for building performance, and enable smarter facility management could reshape the entire building lifecycle, making the construction industry more adaptive and resilient to future challenges.Abstract At present, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is developing rapidly, and the construction industry is facing three major trends: industrialization, greening, and digital intelligence. This paper explores the application of AI technology in the field of architectural design and its impact on design efficiency, with 1810 articles screened from the Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Network (CNKI) search engines, 92 of which were selected for meta-analysis and review. The results show that AI has great potential in the architectural design process, including creative development, data analysis, and problem-solving. In addition, AI has other applications throughout the building lifecycle, such as predictive analytics, construction supervision, and facility maintenance. In addition, through the discussion of traditional architectural design methods and AI-driven architectural design methods, this paper summarizes the advantages and challenges of AI technology in architectural design. Finally, through case analysis, this paper believes that the future of AI in the field of construction is full of infinite possibilities; through the correct guidance and regulation of its development, it will certainly bring more innovation and progress for the construction industry.","[Li, Yangluxi] Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, Wales; [Chen, Huishu] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Yu, Peijun] Hainan Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China; [Yang, Li] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Cardiff University; Shenzhen University; Hainan University; Tongji University,"Yu, PJ (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China.;Yang, L (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",liy209@cardiff.ac.uk; 2161140206@email.szu.edu.cn; pyu@hainanu.edu.cn; yangli.arch@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,93,0,0,17,17,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.","[Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",pany0010@e.ntu.edu.sg; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg,"Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024","Zhang, Limao/0000-0002-7245-3741","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore [04MNP000279C120, 04MNP002126C120]; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [04INS000423C120]","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University)","The Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore (No. 04MNP000279C120; No. 04MNP002126C120) and the Start-Up Grant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (No. 04INS000423C120) are acknowledged for their financial support of this research.",,252,509,525,224,1633,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

We sought to identify the ethical issues and viewpoints of Turkish emergency care doctors about the use of AI during epidemic triage. Materials and methods: Ten emergency specialists were initially enlisted for this project, and their responses to open-ended questions about the ethical issues surrounding AI in the emergency room provided valuable information. A 15-question survey was created based on their input and was refined through a pilot test with 15 emergency specialty doctors. Following that, the updated survey was sent to emergency specialists via email, social media, and private email distribution. Results: 167 emergency medicine specialists participated in the study, with an average age of 38.22 years and 6.79 years of professional experience. The majority agreed that AI could benefit patients (54.50%) and healthcare professionals (70.06%) in emergency department triage during pandemics. Regarding responsibility, 63.47% believed in shared responsibility between emergency medicine specialists and AI manufacturers/programmers for complications. Additionally, 79.04% of participants agreed that the responsibility for complications in AI applications varies depending on the nature of the complication. Concerns about privacy were expressed by 20.36% regarding deep learning-based applications, while 61.68% believed that anonymity protected privacy. Additionally, 70.66% of participants believed that AI systems would be as sensitive as humans in terms of non-discrimination. Conclusion: The potential advantages of deploying AI programs in emergency department triage during pandemics for patients and healthcare providers were acknowledged by emergency medicine doctors in Turkey. Nevertheless, they expressed notable ethical concerns related to the responsibility and accountability aspects of utilizing AI systems in this context.","[Ahun, Erhan] Sabuncuoglu Serefeddin Res & Training Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Amasya, Turkiye; [Demir, Ahmet] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, Mugla, Turkiye; [Yigit, Yavuz] Hamad Med Corp, Dept Emergency Med, Doha, Qatar; [Yigit, Yavuz] Queen Mary Univ London, Blizard Inst, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Tulgar, Yasemin Kocer] Samsun Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Hist & Ethics, Samsun, Turkiye; [Tulgar, Yasemin Kocer; Dogan, Meltem] Kocaeli Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Hist & Ethics, Kocaeli, Turkiye; [Thomas, David Terence] Maltepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Thomas, David Terence] Maltepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat Surg, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Tulgar, Serkan] Samsun Univ, Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Samsun, Turkiye",Mugla Sitki Kocman University; Hamad Medical Corporation; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Samsun University; Kocaeli University; Maltepe University; Maltepe University; Samsun University; Samsun Training & Research Hospital,"Yigit, Y (corresponding author), Hamad Med Corp, Dept Emergency Med, Doha, Qatar.;Yigit, Y (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Blizard Inst, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England.",yyigit@hamad.qa,"Yigit, Yavuz/KRO-5794-2024; Thomas, David/AAT-8828-2021; Demir, Ahmet/LBH-8228-2024; Tulgar, Serkan/AAE-2589-2019","DOGAN, MELTEM/0000-0003-2186-744X","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The projected outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to the development of best practices for effectively motivating university administrators and preparing librarians for adopting AI in library and information centres. Methods - A theoretical framework combining the technology -organization -environment (TOE) framework and the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) guided this qualitative study. Interviews were conducted with 27 senior representatives, including library managers and registrars, from 27 universities across four provinces and the capital city, Islamabad. A systematic approach was employed to analyze the data. Results - The findings indicate that the concept of AI adoption in Pakistani university libraries is new. The library and information sector of Pakistan is slow in adopting AI, which could have implications for its future competitiveness, despite the push for AI adoption by university librarians and administrators. The readiness for AI adoption in this sector is influenced by factors such as organizational technological practices, financial resources, university size, and data management and protection concerns. Conclusion - Library managers and researchers can implement the TOE framework and TRI scale to facilitate AI adoption in a manner that is relevant to library and information settings in Pakistan as well as other parts of the world. Our research indicates that most adoptions are still in their nascent phases, and numerous library managers feel uneasy due to either uncertainties about the precise benefits AI can bring to their libraries or a lack of knowledge and skills for its effective implementation. To manage the networks of internal and external stakeholders essential for successful AI adoption, universities should consider appointing individuals with a specialized knowledge of AI within their libraries.","[Jan, Saeed Ullah] Khushal Khan Khattak Univ Karak, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Karak, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Sajjad Ali] Khushal Khan Khattak Univ, Dept Math, Karak, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Khan, Ali Saeed] Univ Peshawar, Law Coll, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan",University of Peshawar,"Jan, SU (corresponding author), Khushal Khan Khattak Univ Karak, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Karak, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.",dr.saeedullah@kkkuk.edu.pk; sajjadalimath@yahoo.com; alisaeedkhan2004@gmail.com,"Dr.Saeed, Saeed/JCO-9353-2023",,,,,,65,1,1,11,21,UNIV ALBERTA,EDMONTON,"DEPT SOCIOLOGY, EDMONTON, ALBERTA T6G 2E1, CANADA",1715-720X,,,EVID BASED LIB INF P,Evid.

The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into scaled agile development methods (SADMs) has emerged as a potential strategy in response to the ongoing demand for simplified procedures and the increasing complexity of software projects. This paper explores the intersection of AI-driven assistants within the context of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) for large-scale software development, as it stands out as the most widely adopted framework. Our paper pursues three principal objectives: (1) an evaluation of the challenges and impediments encountered by organizations during the implementation of SADMs, (2) an assessment of the potential advantages stemming from the incorporation of AI in large-scale contexts, and (3) the compilation of aspects of SADMs that AI-driven assistants enhance. Through a comprehensive systematic literature review, we identified and described 18 distinct challenges that organizations confront. In the course of our research, we pinpointed seven benefits and five challenges associated with the implementation of AI in SADMs. These findings were systematically categorized based on their occurrence either within the development phase or the phases encompassing planning and control. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 15 different AI-driven assistants and tools, subjecting them to a more detailed examination, and employing them to address the challenges we uncovered during our research. One of the key takeaways from this paper is the exceptional versatility and effectiveness of AI-driven assistants, demonstrating their capability to tackle a broader spectrum of problems. In conclusion, this paper not only sheds light on the transformative potential of AI, but also provides invaluable insights for organizations aiming to enhance their agility and management capabilities.","[Saklamaeva, Vasilka; Pavlic, Luka] Univ Maribor, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Saklamaeva, V (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",vasilka.saklamaeva@um.si; luka.pavlic@um.si,,"Pavlic, Luka/0000-0001-5477-4747; Saklamaeva, Vasilka/0009-0005-0221-4840",Slovenian Research Agency,Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),No Statement Available,,36,5,5,15,45,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Despite many research effort s, it still remains a difficult issue in attaining an accurate forecast model of cash flows due to the risk factors and characteristic of the project. Additionally, cash flow of the construction projects is strongly impacted by sequence and non-sequence factors. Hence, this study proposed a novel artificial intelligence(AI)-based inference model, named symbiotic organisms search-optimized neural network-long short-term memory (SOS-NN-LSTM), which employs symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm to obtain the suitable hyperparameters of the neural network (NN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for establishing a robust hybridization model. In the proposed model, the LSTM technique addresses time series problem with considering the complexity of projects while the NN technique aims at tackling non-sequence factors. The experimental results on 13 construction projects have supported the SOS-NN-LSTM as the best model in forecasting the cash flow by achieving the great est values of (2.55%), MAPE (5.71%), MAE (2.07%), and R2 (0.983). The statistical result further reveals that accuracy of cash flow forecasting can be improved at least 13.4% and 12.0% in terms of RMSE and MAE, respectively, in comparison with other comparative AI-based inference models. The SOS-NN-LSTM model is thus a useful tool to help managers forecast and control cash flow of construction projects. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses the reliability of multiple regression analysis (MRA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR), and hybrid intelligence (Hi) to forecast costs of thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD) equipment. Newly completed equipment-development projects are provided by departments in a Taiwanese high-tech company, which is a top global producer of TFT-LCD equipment. The cross-fold validation method is applied to measure model performance, reliability, and prediction ease. Through comparison of various performance indices, the Hi method outperforms MRA, ANNs and CBR when used for cost prediction during conceptual stages. Although it is well developed in academia, artificial intelligence (AI) is rarely applied in practical project management. This study successfully describes an actionable knowledge-discovery process using a real-world data mining approach for the high-tech equipment manufacturing industry. Project managers (PMs) can benefit from applying the Hi approach to establish latent non-linear cost estimation relationships. The Hi approach is empirically proven an effective prediction technique for PMs considering overall evaluation criteria when determining the best selling prices of TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment to clients.

The growing popularity of IoT opens up new possibilities, and one of the most notable applications is related to the evolving sustainable city paradigm. A sustainable city is normally designed in such a way to consider the environmental impact and a social, economic, and resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same, while the process of managing project requirements is known as requirements management. To design a high-quality project, effective requirements management is imperative. A number of techniques are already available to perform the requirement gathering process, and software developers apply them to collect the requirements. Nevertheless, they are facing many issues in gathering requirements due to a lack of literature on the selection of appropriate methods, which affects the quality of the software. The software design quality can be improved by using requirements capture and management techniques. Some tools are used to comprehend the system accurately. In this paper, a qualitative comparison of requirements-gathering tools using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and requirements-management tools is presented for sustainable cities. With all the tools and techniques available for capturing and managing requirements, it has been proven that software developers have a wide range of alternatives for selecting the best tool that fits their needs, such as chosen by the AI agent. This effort will aid in the development of requirements for IoT-enabled sustainable cities.","[Nadeem, Muhammad Asgher; Lee, Scott Uk-Jin] Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Younus, Muhammad Usman] Univ Jhang, Dept Comp Sci & IT, Jhang 35200, Pakistan; [Younus, Muhammad Usman] Univ Paul Sabatier, Telecommun Toulouse, Ecole Doctorale Math, Informat, F-31330 Toulouse, France",Hanyang University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Lee, SUJ (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",nadeem@hanyang.ac.kr; scottlee@hanyang.ac.kr; usman1644@gmail.com,"Nadeem, Muhammad/AFI-6948-2022; Younus, Muhammad/Y-6441-2019; Lee, Scott Uk-Jin/G-4359-2017","Lee, Scott Uk-Jin/0000-0002-8457-3097",Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2020-0-01343]; Artificial Intelligence Convergence Research Center (Hanyang University ERICA)),"Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Research Center (Hanyang University ERICA))","This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No.2020-0-01343, Artificial Intelligence Convergence Research Center (Hanyang University ERICA)).",,40,1,1,4,17,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,2427,10.3390/su14042427,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14042427,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZM4MH,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000764333100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, high heterogeneity in the desired quality-of-service (QoS) is expected, as 6G networks will offer extremely low-latency and high-throughput services and error-free communication. This complex environment raises significant challenges in resource management while adhering to security and privacy constraints due to the plethora of data generation endpoints. Considering the advances in AI/ML-aided integration in wireless networks and recent efforts on the network data analytics function (NWDAF) by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), this work presents an AI/ML-aided distributed trustable engine (DTE), collecting data from diverse sources of the 6G infrastructure and deploying ML methods for anomaly detection against diverse threat types. Moreover, we present the DTE architecture and its components, providing data management, AI/ML model training, and classification capabilities for anomaly detection. To promote privacy-aware networking, a federated learning (FL) framework to extend the DTE is discussed. Then, the anomaly detection capabilities of the AI/ML-aided DTE are presented in detail, together with the ML model training process, which considers various ML models. For this purpose, we use two open datasets representing attack scenarios in the core and the edge parts of the network. Experimental results, including an ensemble learning method and different supervised learning alternatives, show that the AI/ML-aided DTE can efficiently train ML models with reduced dimensionality and deploy them in diverse cybersecurity scenarios to improve anomaly detection in 6G networks.","[Nomikos, Nikolaos; Patsourakis, Gerasimos; Nikolakakis, Vasileios; Giannopoulos, Anastasios; Gkonis, Panagiotis; Trakadas, Panagiotis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Ports Management & Shipping, Evripus Campus, Euboea 34400, Greece; [Nomikos, Nikolaos; Skianis, Charalabos] Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Samos 83200, Greece; [Xylouris, George] Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Athens 15341, Greece; [Mandilaris, Charilaos] Four Dot Infin, Elliniko 16777, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Aegean; National Centre of Scientific Research Demokritos,"Nomikos, N (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Ports Management & Shipping, Evripus Campus, Euboea 34400, Greece.;Nomikos, N (corresponding author), Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Samos 83200, Greece.",nomikosn@uoa.gr; xilouris@iit.demokritos.gr; gerasimos.patsourakis@gmail.com; vnikolak@uoa.gr; angianno@uoa.gr; chmandilaris@fourdotinfinity.com; pgkonis@uoa.gr; cskianis@aegean.gr; ptrakadas@uoa.gr,"Nomikos, Nikolaos/D-9982-2018; Trakadas, Panagiotis/AAD-7611-2019; Giannopoulos, Anastasios/ABE-1144-2022","Nomikos, Nikolaos/0000-0002-9210-9796; Giannopoulos, Anastasios/0000-0002-8602-7401; Trakadas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-5146-5954",Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) [101096342]; Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme,Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU); Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme,"This research was partially supported by the HORSE project, funded by the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 101096342 (www.horse-6g.eu, accessed on 1 December 2024).",,41,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,FEB,2025,14,3,,,,,,,410,10.3390/electronics14030410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics14030410,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,W4T0F,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001418506300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on energy management, examining its impact on efficiency and emissions across a multi-case analysis of 18 projects in diverse sectors. The findings indicate that Artificial Intelligence positively influences both variables, with variations across applications and sectors. Notably, Artificial Intelligence significantly enhances energy efficiency in four out of six sectors, achieving over 5% improvement in half of the projects. Regarding emissions, positive effects are observed in 15 out of 18 projects, resulting in over 5% reductions in seven cases. Artificial Intelligence plays a pivotal role in emissions reduction in the Design and Energy sectors, with some projects achieving over 20% reductions. Additionally, this study explores how improved energy efficiency positively affects strategic business variables, such as cost, quality, and delivery time. The impact on emissions contributes to reducing occupational risks, particularly those associated with chemical and biological agents.

Research methods used by the authors are literature review, experiments, qualitative and quantitative surveys. The aim of the research is to identify a model / framework to ensure successful implementation of AI solution in an organization. As a result of the study, the authors propose a model / structure that should be followed for the successful implementation of predictive analytics solutions. The main conclusion is that new IT initiatives, as predictive analytics, to some extent, is an IT project, must go through the classic stages of change management, just like any other initiative to change business processes. The authors recommend that companies allocate enough time, human and other necessary resources for the preparation and implementation of predictive analytics solutions. The goal should be clearly defined and measurable, and communication and change in business processes should be carefully planned. Another important step is training.","[Meijere, Sanita; Tambovceva, Tatjana] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Meijere, S (corresponding author), Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",sanita.meijere@rbs.lv; tatjana.tambovceva@rtu.lv,"Tambovceva, Tatjana/G-2828-2010","Tambovceva, Tatjana/0000-0002-9516-1530",,,,,33,0,0,2,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-3-3,,,,2019,,,,,,,6456,6465,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5MP,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000556337408063,View Full Record in Web of Science

The general principles used to automate a mature fab were motivated by a clear economical approach - cost reduction in manufacturing by automation of simple and recurring logistic steps. This can only be successfully completed by an interdisciplinary team work. But there is no ONE recipe for all mature fabs - the older the fab, the more flexible and cost effective the automation concepts must be. Collaboration between human and machine become a key element in this context. One topic in this field is the development of smarter and cost efficient mobile robotic systems (AGV). Smarter means more intelligent, less cost and more stability in process execution. Since we manufacture IoT elements like Time of Flight and Radar sensor in our fabs - we also developed a new integrated sensor fusion concept combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine Learning (ML) methods.","[Heinrich, Harald] Infineon Technol Dresden, Ind Engn & Automat, D-01099 Dresden, Germany; [Deutschlaender, Arthur] Univ Appl Sci, Mech Engn, D-18435 Stralsund, Germany; [Zoghlami, Feryel] Infineon Technol Dresden, Automat Maintenance & Factory Integrat, D-01099 Dresden, Germany; [Sen, Okan Kamil] Infineon Technol AG Munich, Prod Management, D-85579 Neubiberg, Germany",Infineon Technologies; Infineon Technologies; Infineon Technologies,"Heinrich, H (corresponding author), Infineon Technol Dresden, Ind Engn & Automat, D-01099 Dresden, Germany.",harald.heinrich@infineon.com,"sen, okan/KFR-9450-2024","sen, okan/0000-0001-7200-229X",,,,,11,3,3,2,27,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0894-6507,1558-2345,,IEEE T SEMICONDUCT M,IEEE Trans.

These problems are most severe in critical care environments such as intensive care units (ICUs) and operating room (ORs) where many events are life-threatening and thus require immediate attention and the execution of definitive corrective actions. This article focuses on intelligent monitoring and control (IMC), or the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to alleviate some of the common information management problems encountered in health-care environments. This article presents the findings of a survey of over 30 IMC projects. A major finding of the survey is that although significant advances have been made in introducing AI technology in critical care, successful examples of fielded systems are still few and far between.

This may be inevitable due to the increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of our modern world. Many organizations routinely use project structures to develop new products, enter new markets, or upgrade IT systems, for example. A project is a set of tasks aimed at achieving a specific outcome, and a project structure is a temporary structure within which the tasks are performed. Projectification is a process of change whereby organizations increasingly adopt a project way of work. Hence, a projectified organization becomes a hybrid of temporary structures managed as projects and permanent structures managed as functions or departments. Projectification has many downsides, some of which stem from increased organizational complexity. Still, projectification fosters innovation and change, making it a necessary feature in many modern organizations. Ideally, projectification should be done gradually, and it requires significant changes throughout the organization. In this article, we present seven recommendations for senior managers in projectifying organizations. (c) 2025 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To implement preventative procedures, it is necessary to identify patients at risk for POD. In the present study, we aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for POD prediction in older patients, in close cooperation with the PAWEL (patient safety, cost-effectiveness and quality of life in elective surgery) project.Methods The model was trained on the PAWEL study's dataset of 878 patients (no intervention, age >= 70, 209 with POD). Presence of POD was determined by the Confusion Assessment Method and a chart review. We selected 15 features based on domain knowledge, ethical considerations and a recursive feature elimination. A logistic regression and a linear support vector machine (SVM) were trained, and evaluated using receiver operator characteristics (ROC).Results The selected features were American Society of Anesthesiologists score, multimorbidity, cut-to-suture time, estimated glomerular filtration rate, polypharmacy, use of cardio-pulmonary bypass, the Montreal cognitive assessment subscores 'memory', 'orientation' and 'verbal fluency', pre-existing dementia, clinical frailty scale, age, recent falls, post-operative isolation and pre-operative benzodiazepines. The linear SVM performed best, with an ROC area under the curve of 0.82 [95% CI 0.78-0.85] in the training set, 0.81 [95% CI 0.71-0.88] in the test set and 0.76 [95% CI 0.71-0.79] in a cross-centre validation.Conclusion We present a clinically useful and explainable ML model for POD prediction.

However, the orchestration and management of network slicing is very challenging because of the complex configuration process for underlying network resources. Furthermore, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) presented artificial intelligence (AI) based network data analytics function (NWDAF) in 5G for proactive management and intelligence. Therefore, we have developed an intent-based networking (IBN) system for automating network slices and an AI-driven NWDAF for proactive and intelligent resource assurance. The network data analytics function uses a hybrid stacking ensemble learning (STEL) algorithm to predict network resource utilization and a novel automated machine learning (AutoML) and voting ensemble learning-based mechanism to detect and mitigate network anomalies. To validate the performance of the implemented work, real-time datasets were employed, and a comparative analysis was conducted. The experimental result shows that our STEL model enhances the accuracy by 20% and reduces the error rate by 45%. The AutoML and ensemble learning-based optimized model achieved 99.22% accuracy for anomaly detection.","[Abbas, Khizar] Hanyang Univ Seoul, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Abbas, Khizar; Yoo, Jae-Hyung; Hong, James Won-Ki] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Nauman, Ali] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea; [Bilal, Muhammad] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Song, Wang-Cheol] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju 63243, South Korea",Hanyang University; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Yeungnam University; Lancaster University; Jeju National University,"Song, WC (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju 63243, South Korea.",engr.khizarabbas14@gmail.com; anauman@ynu.ac.kr; m.bilal@ieee.org; jhyoo78@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr; philo@jejunu.ac.kr,"Abbas, Khizar/AHA-6327-2022; Nauman, Ali/KJD-5577-2024; Bilal, Muhammad/F-5225-2019","Song, Wang-Cheol/0000-0002-7411-5316; Bilal, Muhammad/0000-0003-4221-0877; Abbas, Khizar/0000-0002-2432-1357; Nauman, Ali/0000-0002-2133-5286",National Research Foundation (NRF) South Korea under Project BK21 FOUR,National Research Foundation (NRF) South Korea under Project BK21 FOUR(National Research Foundation of Korea),No Statement Available,,52,8,8,2,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0098-3063,1558-4127,,IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR,IEEE Trans.

Conventional techniques of requirement prioritization present several challenges, such as scalability, customer satisfaction, efficiency, and dependency management. These challenges make the process difficult to manage effectively. Prioritizing requirements by setting criteria in order of importance is essential to addressing these issues and ensuring the efficient use of resources, especially as software becomes more complex. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to these challenges through algorithms like Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Optimization, and Natural Language Processing. Despite the availability of reviews on conventional prioritization techniques, there is a notable gap in comprehensive reviews of AI-based methods. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of AI-driven requirements prioritization techniques within Agile methodologies, covering 32 papers published between 2010 and 2024. We conducted a parametric analysis of these techniques, identifying key parameters related to both the prioritization process and specific AI methods. Our findings clarify the application domains of various AI-based techniques, offering crucial insights for researchers, requirement analysts, and stakeholders to choose the most effective prioritization methods. These insights consider dependencies and emphasize the importance of collaboration between stakeholders and the development team for optimal results.","[Radwan, Aya M.; Abdel-Fattah, Manal A.; Mohamed, Wael] Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Informat Syst Dept, Cairo, Egypt",,"Radwan, AM (corresponding author), Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Informat Syst Dept, Cairo, Egypt.",,"Mohamed, Wael/AAI-1053-2021",,,,,,45,0,0,4,4,SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD,WEST YORKSHIRE,"19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",2158-107X,2156-5570,,INT J ADV COMPUT SC,Int.

However, the focus of previous research and AI applications has therefore mostly been on large enterprises. This poses a particular issue, as the vastly different starting conditions of various company sizes, such as data availability, play a central role in the context of AI. For this reason, our systematic literature review, based on the PRISMA protocol, consolidates the state of the art of AI with an explicit focus on SMEs and highlights the perceived challenges regarding implementation in this company size. This allowed us to identify various business activities that have been scarcely considered. Simultaneously, it led to the discovery of a total of 27 different challenges perceived by SMEs in the adoption of AI. This enables SMEs to apply the identified challenges to their own AI projects in advance, preventing the oversight of any potential obstacles or risks. The lack of knowledge, costs, and inadequate infrastructure are perceived as the most common barriers to implementation, addressing social, economic, and technological aspects in particular. This illustrates the need for a wide range of support for SMEs regarding an AI introduction, which covers various subject areas, like funding and advice, and differentiates between company sizes.","[Oldemeyer, Leon; Jede, Andreas] Univ Appl Sci Osnabrueck, Osnabruck, Germany; [Teuteberg, Frank] Univ Osnabrueck, Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Oldemeyer, L (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Osnabrueck, Osnabruck, Germany.",leon.oldemeyer@hs-osnabrueck.de; a.jede@hs-osnabrueck.de; frank.teuteberg@uni-osnabrueck.de,,"Oldemeyer, Leon/0000-0002-3875-4954",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

These systems possess the capacity to enhance decision-making processes and optimize the results of projects. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct a thorough and inclusive examination that incorporates and evaluates the various methodologies employed within this particular discipline, thereby bridging the existing void in research. The current state of research in the field of AI and ML in construction engineering is characterized by a dearth of comprehensive reviews that encompass the wide array of methodologies utilized. Although certain studies have delved into specific facets of this subject, there remains a novelty and research gap in terms of a holistic examination of the topic. The objective of this review is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of AI and ML methodologies in the field of construction engineering, with a specific emphasis on their practical applications, advantages, and constraints. The study also ascertains potential areas for future research and improvement in the domain of Intelligent DSS. This study employed a rigorous approach that involved an extensive review of scholarly literature and empirical investigations from 2001 to June 2023. The findings of the analysis indicate a noticeable increase in the number of research papers focusing on Intelligent DSS within the field of construction engineering during the last twenty years. The field has witnessed the emergence of key research areas, namely the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT), explainable AI, supply chain optimization, sustainable construction practices, and human-machine collaboration. The results of this study hold significant implications for the construction industry. The incorporation of AI and ML techniques within Intelligent DSS can effectively tackle various issues such as cost overruns, project delays, and safety concerns.","[Waqar, Ahsan] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Petronas,"Waqar, A (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia.",ahsan_21002791@utp.edu.my,,,,,,,215,12,12,49,98,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

In this context, city brains represent an emerging type of generative AI currently employed in urban governance and public policy in a growing number of cities. City brains are large-scale AIs residing in vast digital urban platforms, which manage multiple urban domains including transport, safety, health, and environmental monitoring. They use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate visions of urban futures: visions that are in turn used by policymakers to generate new urban policies. In this paper, we advance a twofold contribution. Theoretically, we develop a critical theory of anticipatory governance in the age of generative AI. More specifically, we focus on technocratic approaches to anticipatory governance, to explain how the act of governing extends into the future by means of predictive AI technology. Our approach is critical in order to expose the dangers that the use of AI (generative AI, in particular) in urban governance poses, and to identify their causes. These dangers include the formation of a policy process that, under the influence of unintelligible LLMs, risks losing transparency and thus accountability, and the marginalization of human stakeholders (citizens, in particular) as the role of AI in the management of cities keeps growing and governance begins to turn posthuman. Empirically, we critically examine an existing city brain project under development in China and ground our critical theory in a real-life example.","[Cugurullo, Federico; Xu, Ying] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Cugurullo, F (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin, Ireland.",cugurulf@tcd.ie,"Cugurullo, Federico/HGV-1243-2022; XU, YING/HTS-5265-2023","XU, YING/0000-0001-6344-9612",Irish Research Council [IRCLA/2022/3832],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",This work is part of the ORACLE project funded by the Irish Research Council (project ID: IRCLA/2022/3832).,,61,6,6,66,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1449-4035,1839-3373,,POLICY SOC,Policy Soc.,2024 AUG 1,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/polsoc/puae025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/polsoc/puae025,,AUG 2024,18,Political Science; Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law; Public Administration,A3S1Q,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001281754400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With AI gaining popularity and spreading in all sectors including the government, the public sector should have enough professionals who are equipped with modern knowledge and practical skills on how to employ AI for public services while taking into account ethical and moral needs. One way to ensure that governments are able to employ these individuals is to build capacities and train these professionals. The paper presents the results of the preliminary research on the competences of a functional specialist in AI for public services. The data was collected through a questionnaire that was sent out to AI professionals with a high level of expertise who represent both public and private sector as well as international organisations. The research shows that there is no unanimous opinion of the role of such specialist. The majority of respondents lean towards seeing him/her/them as an intermediary between the technical side and public policy side, while some respondents consider him/her/them as a technical professional or a data scientist. In any case, a functional specialist in AI for public services is expected to have interdisciplinary knowledge and skills that include technical, business and management and design thinking skills. A detailed list of the required competences has to be defined later when more data is collected. In the preliminary research phase, the list of technical skill has caused the biggest debate.","[Labanava, Alena; Dreyling, Richard Michael, III; Liiv, Innar; Pappel, Ingrid] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Mortati, Marzia] Politecn Milan, Piazza Leonardo, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Tallinn University of Technology; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Labanava, A (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",alena.labanava@taltech.ee,,"Labanava, Alena/0000-0001-6318-7704; Pappel, Ingrid/0000-0002-5148-9841; Dreyling, Richard/0000-0001-7269-6236; MORTATI, MARZIA/0000-0002-6900-403X",,,,,40,3,3,3,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-981-19-8068-8; 978-981-19-8069-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2022,1688,,,,,,503,516,,10.1007/978-981-19-8069-5_34,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-8069-5_34,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BU5ZH,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000921145600034,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), Conversational AI came of age in 2010 with the launch of Apple's Siri. Conversational AI systems leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and converse with humans via speech and text. These systems have been deployed in sectors such as aviation, tourism, and healthcare. However, the application of Conversational AI in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry is lagging, and little is known about the state of research on Conversational AI. Thus, this study presents a systematic review of Conversational AI in the AEC industry to provide insights into the current development and conducted a Focus Group Discussion to highlight challenges and validate areas of opportunities. The findings reveal that Conversational AI applications hold immense benefits for the AEC industry, but it is currently underexplored. The major challenges for the under exploration were highlighted and discusses for intervention. Lastly, opportunities and future research directions of Conversational AI are projected and validated which would improve the productivity and efficiency of the industry. This study presents the status quo of a fast-emerging research area and serves as the first attempt in the AEC field. Its findings would provide insights into the new field which be of benefit to researchers and stakeholders in the AEC industry.","[Saka, Abdullahi B.] Leeds Beckett Univ, Sch Built Environm Engn & Comp, Leeds, England; [Oyedele, Lukumon O.; Akanbi, Lukman A.; Bello, Sururah A.] Univ West England, Fac Business & Law, Big Data Enterprise & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Bristol, England; [Ganiyu, Sikiru A.] Teesside Univ, Teesside Univ Int Business Sch, Middlesbrough, England; [Chan, Daniel W.

Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL.

Despite these transformations, there are major challenges to address critical issues like insufficient healthcare infrastructure for the country's huge population, limited accessibility, shortage of skilled professionals, and high-quality care. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions have the potential to lessen the stress on India's healthcare system; however, integrating trustworthy AI in the sector remains challenging due to ethical and regulatory constraints. This study aims to critically review the current status of the development of AI systems in Indian healthcare and how well it satisfies the ethical and legal aspects of AI, as well as to identify the challenges and opportunities in adoption of trustworthy AI in the Indian healthcare sector. This study reviewed 15 articles selected from a total of 1136 articles gathered from two electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as project websites. This study makes use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). It finds that the existing studies mostly used conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for a variety of tasks, such as drug discovery, disease surveillance systems, early disease detection and diagnostic accuracy, and management of healthcare resources in India. This study identifies a gap in the adoption of trustworthy AI in Indian healthcare and various challenges associated with it. It explores opportunities for developing trustworthy AI in Indian healthcare settings, prioritizing patient safety, data privacy, and compliance with ethical and legal standards.","[Chettri, Sarat Kumar] Assam Don Bosco Univ, Dept Comp Applicat, Gauhati 781017, India; [Deka, Rup Kumar] Assam Down Town Univ, Fac Comp Technol, Gauhati 781026, India; [Saikia, Manob Jyoti] Univ Memphis, Biomed Sensors & Syst Lab, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Saikia, Manob Jyoti] Univ Memphis, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Assam Don Bosco University; Assam Down Town University; University of Memphis; University of Memphis,"Saikia, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Biomed Sensors & Syst Lab, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.;Saikia, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",sarat.chettri@dbuniversity.ac.in; rup.deka@adtu.in; msaikia@memphis.edu,"Chettri, Sarat/AAK-6197-2020; Deka, Rup/AAH-9853-2019; Saikia, Manob Jyoti/Q-6279-2018","Chettri, Dr. Sarat Kumar/0000-0002-6031-6440; Saikia, Manob Jyoti/0000-0001-6656-4333","Biomedical Sensors & Systems Lab, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA","Biomedical Sensors & Systems Lab, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA","The authors thank the Biomedical Sensors & Systems Lab, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA, for supporting this research and the article processing charges.",,58,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-2688,,AI-BASEL,AI,JAN,2025,6,1,,,,,,,10,10.3390/ai6010010,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ai6010010,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,T3J9B,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001404023200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The motivation of this work is the absence in the literature of a model to establish the relationship among leadership and agility factors, by means of the integration of prediction and sensitivity analysis capacities. The originality of this work lies on the presentation of a general model integrating both capacities, dedicated to the analysis of different kind of projects. The first part of the study deals with a literature review regarding the components of leadership, organizational structure, agility, flexibility and organizational factors and the intrinsic relationship among them. This information is the basis of the framework of this study that serves for the construction of the model. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and statistical tools are used for modeling purposes. From the model application, it is possible to identify under which conditions of leadership style and organizational factors there are the highest chances of high project performances.

At the same time, the access and ability to process large volumes of network data can unleash the full potential of a network orchestrated by AI/ML to optimise the usage of available resources while keeping both CapEx and OpEx low. Driven by these new opportunities, the ongoing standardisation activities indicate strong interest to reap the benefits of incorporating AI and ML techniques in communication networks. For instance, 3GPP has introduced the network data analytics function (NWDAF) at the 5G core network for the control and management of network slices, and for providing predictive analytics, or statistics, about past events to other network functions, leveraging AI/ML and big data analytics. Likewise, at the radio access network (RAN), the O-RAN Alliance has already defined an architecture to infuse intelligence into the RAN, where closed-loop control models are classified based on their operational timescale, i.e., real-time, near real-time, and non-real-time RAN intelligent control (RIC). Different from the existing related surveys, in this review article, we group the major research studies in the design of model-aided ML-based transceivers following the breakdown suggested by the O-RAN Alliance. At the core and the edge networks, we review the ongoing standardisation activities in intelligent networking and the existing works cognisant of the architecture recommended by 3GPP and ETSI. We also review the existing trends in ML algorithms running on low-power micro-controller units, known as TinyML. We conclude with a summary of recent and currently funded projects on intelligent communications and networking. This review reveals that the telecommunication industry and standardisation bodies have been mostly focused on non-real-time RIC, data analytics at the core and the edge, AI-based network slicing, and vendor inter-operability issues, whereas most recent academic research has focused on real-time RIC. In addition, intelligent radio resource management and aspects of intelligent control of the propagation channel using reflecting intelligent surfaces have captured the attention of ongoing research projects.","[Koufos, Konstantinos; Ei Haloui, Karim; Dianati, Mehrdad; Higgins, Matthew] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Elmirghani, Jaafar] Univ Leeds, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Imran, Muhammad Ali] Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Tafazolli, Rahim] Univ Surrey, Inst Commun Syst ICS, 5G & 6G Innovat Ctr, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Warwick; University of Leeds; University of Glasgow; University of Surrey,"Dianati, M (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Konstantinos.Koufos@warwick.ac.uk; Karim.el-Haloui@warwick.ac.uk; M.Dianati@warwick.ac.uk; M.Higgins@warwick.ac.uk; J.M.H.Elmirghani@leeds.ac.uk; Muhammad.Imran@glasgow.ac.uk; r.tafazolli@surrey.ac.uk,"Higgins, Matthew/A-8467-2010; Elmirghani, Jaafar/B-1903-2012; Tafazolli, Rahim/AAF-8263-2019; Imran, Muhammad Ali/I-4832-2012","Higgins, Matthew/0000-0001-6863-6476; tafazolli, rahim/0000-0002-6062-8639; Dianati, Mehrdad/0009-0001-6971-0348; Imran, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-4743-9136",,,,,103,14,14,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2224-2708,,J SENS ACTUAT NETW,J.

However, there is evidence that bias is already prevalent in AI datasets and algorithms, which, albeit unintended, is considered to be unethical, suboptimal, unsustainable, and challenging to manage. It is believed that the governance of data and algorithmic bias must be deeply embedded in the values, mindsets, and procedures of AI software development teams, but currently there is a paucity of actionable mechanisms to help. In this paper, we describe a maturity framework based on ethical principles and best practices, which can be used to evaluate an organization's capability to govern bias. We also design, construct, validate, and test an original instrument for operationalizing the framework, which considers both technical and organizational aspects. The instrument has been developed and validated through a two-phase study involving field experts and academics. The framework and instrument are presented for ongoing evolution and utilization.","[Coates, D.

Measures were obtained at baseline and after completing a 16-session educational curriculum focusing on weight loss through behavioral changes. At baseline, psychological distress and negative family support were linked to greater weight, whereas cultural spirituality was correlated with lower weight. Furthermore, psychological distress and negative family support predicted less weight loss, and positive family support predicted greater weight loss, over the course of the intervention. These bivariate relationships between psychosocial factors and weight remained statistically significant within a multivariate model, after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Conversely, coping skills and trauma exposure were not significantly associated with baseline weight or change in weight. These findings demonstrate the influence of psychosocial factors on weight loss in AI/AN communities and have substantial implications for incorporating adjunctive intervention components.","[Dill, Edward J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Manson, Spero M.; Pratte, Katherine A.; Gutilla, Margaret J.; Knepper, Stephanie L.; Beals, Janette; Special Diabet Program Indians] Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Amer Indian & Alaska Native Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Jiang, Luohua] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Roubideaux, Yvette] Indian Hlth Serv, Off Director, Rockville, MD 20852 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Colorado School of Public Health; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Dill, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",edward.dill@ucdenver.edu,,,Indian Health Service [HHSI242200400049C]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [1P30DK092923]; American Diabetes Association (ADA) [7-12-CT-36],Indian Health Service(United States Department of Health & Human Services); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); American Diabetes Association (ADA)(American Diabetes Association),"Funding for this project was provided by the Indian Health Service (HHSI242200400049C to S.

Nevertheless, AI applications have not been consolidated as standard solutions in the industry, and most common applications of AI still are case studies and pilot projects. In this work, an analysis of a survey conducted on a broad group of professionals related to several E&P operations and service companies is presented. This survey captures the level of AI knowledge in the industry, the most common application areas, and the expectations of the users from AI-based solutions. It also includes a literature review of technical papers related to AI applications and trends in the market and in research and development. The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% of respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most affected by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of AI technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles. This work aims to be a guide for personnel responsible for production and asset management on how AI-based applications can add more value and improve their decision making. The results of the survey offer a guideline on which tools to consider for each particular oil and gas challenge. It also illustrates how AI techniques will play an important role in future developments of information-technology (IT) solutions in the E&P industry.","[Bravo, Cesar] Lankmark Halliburton, Intelligent Operat Solut, Houston, TX 77042 USA; [Saputelli, Luigi] Frontender Corp, Houston, TX USA; [Rivas, Francklin; Gabriela Perez, Anna] Univ Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela; [Nikolaou, Michael] Univ Houston, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [de Guzman, Neil] Intelligent Agent Corp, Houston, TX USA; [Mohaghegh, Shahab] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Nunez, Gustavo] Schlumberger, Houston, TX USA",Halliburton; University of Los Andes Venezuela; University of Houston System; University of Houston; West Virginia University; Schlumberger,"Bravo, C (corresponding author), Lankmark Halliburton, Intelligent Operat Solut, Houston, TX 77042 USA.",,", Michael/HKE-2651-2023; Rivas, Francklin/Q-8519-2019","Nikolaou, Michael/0000-0003-0241-6600; Rivas, Francklin/0000-0002-5201-2877; Saputelli, Luigi/0000-0001-6912-4886",,,,,43,43,48,0,43,SOC PETROLEUM ENG,RICHARDSON,"222 PALISADES CREEK DR,, RICHARDSON, TX 75080 USA",1086-055X,1930-0220,,SPE J,SPE J.,AUG,2014,19,4,,,,,547,563,,10.2118/150314-PA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/150314-PA,,,17,"Engineering, Petroleum",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,AU0AM,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000345285500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Machine learning, a subfield of AI, can be used to analyze surgical video and imaging data. Manual annotations provide veracity about the desired target features. Yet, methodological annotation explorations are limited to date. Here, we provide an exploratory analysis of the requirements and methods of instrument annotation in a multi-institutional team from two specialized AI centers and compile our lessons learned. Methods We developed a bottom-up approach for team annotation of robotic instruments in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN), which was subsequently validated in robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE). Furthermore, instrument annotation methods were evaluated for their use in Machine Learning algorithms. Overall, we evaluated the efficiency and transferability of the proposed team approach and quantified performance metrics (e.g., time per frame required for each annotation modality) between RAPN and RAMIE. Results We found a 0.05 Hz image sampling frequency to be adequate for instrument annotation. The bottom-up approach in annotation training and management resulted in accurate annotations and demonstrated efficiency in annotating large datasets. The proposed annotation methodology was transferrable between both RAPN and RAMIE. The average annotation time for RAPN pixel annotation ranged from 4.49 to 12.6 min per image; for vector annotation, we denote 2.92 min per image. Similar annotation times were found for RAMIE. Lastly, we elaborate on common pitfalls encountered throughout the annotation process. Conclusions We propose a successful bottom-up approach for annotator team composition, applicable to any surgical annotation project. Our results set the foundation to start AI projects for instrument detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. Due to the immense annotation burden resulting from spatial instrumental annotation, further analysis into sampling frequency and annotation detail needs to be conducted.","[De Backer, Pieter; Simoens, Jente; Mottrie, Alexandre] ORSI Acad, Proefhoevestr 12, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [Eckhoff, Jennifer A.; Mueller, Dolores T.; Bruns, Christiane J.; Fuchs, Hans F.] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Gen Visceral Tumor & Transplantsurg, Robot Innovat Lab, Cologne, Germany; [De Backer, Pieter; Allaeys, Charlotte; Creemers, Heleen; Hallemeesch, Amelie; Mestdagh, Kenzo] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Human Struct & Repair, Ghent, Belgium; [De Backer, Pieter; Debbaut, Charlotte] Univ Ghent, IBiTech Biommeda, Fac Engn & Architecture, Ghent, Belgium; [De Backer, Pieter; Debbaut, Charlotte] Univ Ghent, CRIG, Ghent, Belgium; [De Backer, Pieter; Van Praet, Charles; Decaestecker, Karel] Ghent Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, Ghent, Belgium; [Meireles, Ozanan] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Surg Artificial Intelligence & Innovat Lab, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mottrie, Alexandre] OLV Hosp Aalst Asse Ninove, Dept Urol, Aalst, Belgium",University of Cologne; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital,"De Backer, P (corresponding author), ORSI Acad, Proefhoevestr 12, B-9090 Melle, Belgium.;De Backer, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Human Struct & Repair, Ghent, Belgium.;De Backer, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, IBiTech Biommeda, Fac Engn & Architecture, Ghent, Belgium.;De Backer, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, CRIG, Ghent, Belgium.;De Backer, P (corresponding author), Ghent Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, Ghent, Belgium.",pieter.de.backer@orsi.be,"Decaestecker, Karel/HPE-7748-2023; Eckhoff, Jennifer/JKI-8047-2023","Debbaut, Charlotte/0000-0003-1962-238X; Decaestecker, Karel/0000-0003-0767-940X; De Backer, Pieter/0000-0002-9375-2353",Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship Agency [HBC.2020.2252],Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship Agency,Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship Agency (Reference HBC.2020.2252).,,19,18,18,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-2794,1432-2218,,SURG ENDOSC,Surg.

This paper will examine the potential application of this process to NDE 4.0 developments. This paper will also explore the factors that make a stage-gate process successful, and how biases affect the outcomes of gate reviews. It explores which biases are problematic and how we can de-bias our own interpretation of them through conscious awareness and re-thinking the Stage-Gate Process. It also discusses how to create an environment where biases are minimized or eliminated. During research and reporting of this manuscript, the human authors synthesized their decades of experience in engaging with technology development decisions, with contributions from an artificial intelligence agent GPT-3 on human biases and motivations. This was done to capture the firsthand experience of collaborating with AI in the spirit of increasing the role of machine intelligence in human-machine systems, typical of NDE. Since this appeared to be an innovative approach, the authors decided to use the gated process in creating this paper with AI as a co-author. The details are presented as a case study within the paper. The topic is important because, managers are struggling to embrace the NDE 4.0 initiative, despite its importance and their willingness. Leveraging AI partnership to even address this important topic is a testament to cognitive capability of learning machines to help inspection systems with creating test procedures, making decisions, and creating test reports. This manuscript is the first attempt at qualitative treatment of human factors in gated innovation process with research assisted by an Artificial Intelligence based language model (non-human).

Efficiency is heavily reliant on shared resources in a modern cloud computing culture. Although data or service sharing is highly appreciated for collaborative projects, preserving identity and access management security is challenging in this context. The difficulties encountered are diverse, including a single point of failure, incompatibility, dynamic user groups, trust establishment, and revocation. Despite extensive research, certain obstacles and issues need to be addressed. In this article, challenges in access management in centralized and decentralized identity governance are grouped into different categories and accompanied by background information on the topic. Studies and implemented projects have been evaluated regarding their value and flaws. Traditional approaches, such as centralized and federated identity, as well as more futuristic methods, such as blockchain-based decentralized identity, AI/ML access management, and ABE schema, have been investigated while writing this paper. A comparative evaluation of the proposed studies has been included, where the differences and similarities can be observed.","[Badirova, Aytaj; Dabbaghi, Shirin; Moghaddam, Faraz Fatemi; Wieder, Philipp; Yahyapour, Ramin] Gesell Wissensch Datenverarbeitung mbH Gottingen G, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; Georg August Univ Gottingen, Inst Informat, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Badirova, A; Dabbaghi, S; Moghaddam, FF; Wieder, P; Yahyapour, R (corresponding author), Gesell Wissensch Datenverarbeitung mbH Gottingen G, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",aytaj.badirova@gwdg.de; sdabbag@gwdg.de; ffatemi@gwdg.de; philipp.wieder@gwdg.de; ramin.yahyapour@gwdg.de,"Fatemi Moghaddam, Faraz/GWZ-2451-2022; Yahyapour, Ramin/AAM-1875-2020","Dabbaghi Varnosfaderani, Shirin/0000-0002-5355-5320; Yahyapour, Ramin/0000-0002-9057-4395",,,,,117,5,5,4,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,61660,61679,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3279492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3279492,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,K8BX9,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001018648600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition to characteristics of academic problems, such as the need to reason about actions, real-life problems require detailed knowledge elicitation, engineering, and management. A systematic design process in which Knowledge and Requirements Engineering tools play a fundamental role is necessary in such applications. One of the main challenges in such design process, and consequently in the study of Knowledge Engineering in AI planning, has been the analysis of requirements and their subsequent transformation into an input-ready model for planners. itSIMPLE is a research project dedicated to the study of a project process to support the design phases of real-life planning models. In this paper, we give an overview of itSIMPLE focusing on the main translation processes among a minimal set of representations: from requirements represented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) to Petri Nets and from UML models to planning domain definition language for problem solving.","[Vaquero, Tiago S.; Silva, Jose R.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Mechatron, Escola Politecn, BR-05508030 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vaquero, Tiago S.; Beck, J.

However, the lack of a standard procedure for ensuring the existence of a sufficient and high-quality data basis often leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and resource waste, resulting in a high risk of project failure. Existing methodologies often presuppose the availability of a data basis, which is a significant challenge, particularly in the manufacturing sector with its diverse and complex data sources. This challenge is further compounded by the interdisciplinary nature of these projects, where domain experts and data scientists with different expertise and vocabularies must collaborate. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces ML-SIPOC, a novel methodology for creating a standardized and high-quality data basis for data-driven projects. ML-SIPOC builds upon the traditional SIPOC analysis from the Six Sigma management system for operational excellence, adapted to meet the unique challenges of data-intensive projects. It provides a structured framework for systematically building a data foundation, facilitating effective communication between domain experts and data scientists. When applied in electronics manufacturing, ML-SIPOC proved efficient in creating a robust data basis, reducing time and cost overheads. This approach minimizes reliance on prior knowledge for data collection, opening up possibilities for broader AI and Big Data applications across various manufacturing sectors. The key innovation of this paper is the introduction of a first-of-its-kind methodology that provides a structured approach to building a data foundation for data-driven decision making in manufacturing.","[Meier, Sven; Thielen, Nils; Kuhn, Marlene; Franke, Joerg] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Inst Factory Automat & Prod Syst FAPS, Nurnberg, Germany; [Klarmann, Steffen; Pfefferer, Christian] Valeo Schalter & Sensoren GmbH, Wemding, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Meier, S (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Inst Factory Automat & Prod Syst FAPS, Nurnberg, Germany.",sven.meier@faps.fau.de,"; Franke, Jorg/N-7819-2013","Meier, Sven/0000-0003-0445-1477; Franke, Jorg/0000-0003-0700-2028; Klarmann, Steffen/0000-0001-9711-0836","Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (StMWi); VDI/VDE-IT [DIK-0210-0005//DIK0247]","Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (StMWi); VDI/VDE-IT","The authors want to thank the Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (StMWi) and the VDI/VDE-IT for funding this research (grant ID: DIK-0210-0005//DIK0247) .",,51,2,2,8,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

Although several previous studies have focused on this complex issue from different perspectives, such as predicting accidents for the general construction process, few studies have focused on the impact of project characteristics on the likelihood of accidents in building maintenance projects. Artificial intelligence-based predictive models for workplace accidents typically use readymade algorithms or traditional methods like trial and error. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to predict the likelihood of occupational accidents in building maintenance projects by following a new feature selection process based on the topological approach. The information on the 1807 public school maintenance project was included in this study to test the proposed mathematical approach. Commonly used 7 different machine learning algorithms and a combination of these algorithms called a hybrid model was selected to apply the topological approach to the feature selection process. The results show that 5 out of 7 algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Hybrid (HYB) models show better performance after applying the topological technique. The main predictors of the likelihood of workplace accidents in these algorithms are site delivery (T2), cost breakdown ratio (F1), total duration (T1), and contractor size (P1). Using this approach, construction professionals can develop and implement more effective AI-based proactive safety management systems for maintenance projects.","[Yigit, Ugur] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Math, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Kazar, Gokhan] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Kazar, Gokhan] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34310 Istanbul, Turkiye",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Istanbul Medeniyet University; Istanbul Gelisim University,"Yigit, U (corresponding author), Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Math, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkiye.",ugur.yigit@medeniyet.edu.tr; gokhan.kazar@medeniyet.edu.tr,"Yigit, Ugur/HZK-8037-2023; KAZAR, GOKHAN/LOR-1007-2024",,,,,,75,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Explainability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been developed for this purpose, allowing a deeper understanding of the decisions of AI models. This extended study explores the implementation of a federated learning system for further improving machine learning algorithms. Federated learning allows model training on decentralised data while preserving data privacy and security. The aim of using methods such as SHAP and LIME is to increase the transparency of AI systems and user trust in these systems. These approaches were first implemented in an initial project focused on predictions related to the production time and project management in industry. The obtained results show that federated learning, combined with explainability methods, not only improves the forecast accuracy, but also strengthens the trust among stakeholders. A possible future direction would be to also apply these strategies to other processes in the field of Industry 4.0 and manufacturing, in order to promote the adoption of more comprehensible and innovative intelligent systems.","[Ribeiro, Jose; Santos, Ricardo; Silva, Fabio] Politecn Porto, CIICESI, ESTG, Porto, Portugal; [Analide, Cesar] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Res Ctr, LASI, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Universidade do Minho,"Ribeiro, J (corresponding author), Politecn Porto, CIICESI, ESTG, Porto, Portugal.",jfr@estg.ipp.pt; rjs@estg.ipp.pt; analide@di.uminho.pt; fas@estg.ipp.pt,,,"FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UIDB/04728/2020, UIDP/04728/2020]",FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),Acknowledgements This work has been supported by national funds through FCT - Fundac & atilde;o para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through projects UIDB/04728/2020 and UIDP/04728/2020.,,24,0,0,2,2,NATL INST R&D INFORMATICS-ICI,BUCHAREST,"PUBL DEPT, 8-10 AVERESCU BLVD, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011455, ROMANIA",1220-1766,,,STUD INFORM CONTROL,Stud.

This shift is needed especially for complex, high-value agricultural ecosystems such as those in the Western U.S., where 300+ crops are grown. Farmers and policy makers in this region face variable profitability, major crop loss and poor crop quality owing to several challenges, including increased labor costs and shortages of skilled workers, weather and management uncertainties, and water scarcity. While AI is expected to be a significant tool for addressing these challenges, AI capabilities must be expanded and will need to account for human input and human behavior - calling for a strong AI-Ag coalition that also creates new opportunities to achieve sustained innovation. Accomplishing this goal goes well beyond the scope of any specific research project or disciplinary silo and requires a more holistic transdisciplinary effort in research, development, and training. To respond to this need, we initiated the AgAID Institute, a multi-institution, transdisciplinary National AI Research Institute that will build new public-private partnerships involving a diverse range of stakeholders in both agriculture and AI. The institute focuses its efforts on providing AI solutions to specialty crop agriculture where the challenges pertaining to water availability, climate variability and extreme weather, and labor shortages, are all significantly pronounced. Our approach to all AgAID Institute activities is being guided by three cross-cutting principles: (i) adoption as a first principle in AI design; (ii) adaptability to changing environments and scales, and (iii) amplification of human skills and machine efficiency. The AgAID Institute is conducting a range of activities including: using agricultural AI applications as testbeds for developing innovative AI technologies and workflows; laying the technological foundations for climate-smart agriculture; serving as a nexus for culturally inclusive collaborative and transdisciplinary learning and knowledge co-production; preparing the next generation workforce for careers at the intersection of Ag and AI technology; and facilitating technology adoption and transfer.","[Kalyanaraman, Ananth; Khot, Lav] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA USA; [Burnett, Margaret; Fern, Alan] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR USA; [Viers, Joshua] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA USA",Washington State University; Oregon State University; University of California System; University of California Merced,"Kalyanaraman, A (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA USA.",ananth@wsu.edu,"Viers, Joshua/ABC-1851-2020","Khot, Lav/0000-0002-5018-7825; Sallato, Bernardita V/0000-0003-0970-3434; Viers, Joshua/0000-0001-7957-7942","United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2021-67021-35344]; U.S. National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Agriculture, National AI Research Institutes program","United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); U.S. National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Agriculture, National AI Research Institutes program","Other AgAID Institute members and key contributors to this work include John Abatzoglou, Jennifer Adam, Abhijin Adiga, Leigh Bernacchi, Jessica Black, LeAnn Brosius, Jenny Bolivar-Medina, Michael Brady, David Brown, Ian Cummings, Joseph Davidson, Nancy Deringer, Amit Dhingra, Jana Doppa, Cindi Dunn, Reza Ehsani, Xiaoli Fern, Joshua Goldstein, Cindy Grimm, Sonia Hall, Rebecca Hutchinson, Jor-dan Jobe, Minsuk Kahng, Lee Kalcsits, Manoj Karkee, Markus Keller, Heather Knight, Chad Kruger, Stefan Lee, Mingliang Liu, Steve Mantle, Madhav Marathe, Josue Medellin-Azuara, Paola Pesantez-Cabrera, Troy Peters, Raviv Raich, Kirti Rajagopalan, Sai Ramaswamy, S.

The obtained results are essential for the remaining demonstration results because they offer an incredibly accurate basis for further research into their use in congestion management and other weather-related enhanced transmission and distribution system planning and operation practices.","[Zafeiropoulou, Magda; Zoulias, Emmanouil; Vita, Vasiliki; Maris, Theodoros I.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens NKUA, Core Dept, Euripus Complex, Psahna Euboea 34400, Greece; [Sijakovic, Nenad; Zarkovic, Mileta; Ristic, Vladan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Elect Engn, Bul Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Terzic, Aleksandar] Energoinfo Grp, N Ninkov 3, Belgrade 11090, Serbia; [Makrygiorgou, Dimitra; Fotis, Georgios] Independent Power Transmiss Operator IPTO, Dyrrachiou 89 & Kifissou, Athens 10443, Greece; [Vita, Vasiliki; Fotis, Georgios] ASPETE Sch Pedag & Technol Educ Athens, Dept Elect & Elect Engn Educators, Maroussi 15122, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Belgrade,"Vita, V (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens NKUA, Core Dept, Euripus Complex, Psahna Euboea 34400, Greece.;Vita, V (corresponding author), ASPETE Sch Pedag & Technol Educ Athens, Dept Elect & Elect Engn Educators, Maroussi 15122, Greece.",mzafeir@uoa.gr; sijakovicnenad@gmail.com; mileta@etf.bg.ac.rs; vladagenius.vr@gmail.com; aleksandar.terzic@energoinfogroup.com; di.makrygiorgou@admie.gr; ezoulias@uoa.gr; vasvita@aspete.gr; maristhe@uoa.gr; 20fot.geo@ta.aspete.gr,"Fotis, Georgios/GPP-2396-2022; Zoulias, Emmanouil/AAL-1125-2021","Makrygiorgou, Jemma J./0000-0002-1110-3203; Zarkovic, Mileta/0000-0001-5855-6595; Fotis, Georgios/0000-0003-1684-8738; Terzic, Aleksandar/0000-0003-1234-9990",European Union [957739],European Union(European Union (EU)),This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 957739 (ONENET project).

Drones, U-space, UTM, and their application to Air Mobility are fostering new applications that evolve quicker than the regulatory framework. For instance, the number of domains of applications is increasing, ranging from infrastructure inspection to parcel deliveries in urban settings. Thus, the number of drones flying simultaneously in the same geographical area is expected to grow over the next few years. It will soon pose safety issues as it might become more and more challenging to ensure safe control of drones so that they are separated from each other and with manned flight operations. The deconfliction or separation management problem, a pressing issue, has been tackled in several research projects. However, there is still an urgent need for a better approach to automate deconfliction at the strategic and tactical levels. Our SESAR-funded project (AI4HyDrop) aims to explore the use of machine learning to develop an intelligent control system to resolve drone deconfliction. To this purpose, we have conducted an extensive literature review, as outlined in this paper. This research was needed to understand better how AI has been explored in the field of UAV's deconfliction and thus will pave the way for basic concepts that contribute to the requirement elicitation for an AI model-based UAV's deconfliction.","[Xuan-Phuc Phan Nguyen; Ruseno, Neno; Chagas, Fabio Suim; Bechina, Aurelie Aurilla Arntzen] Univ South Eastern Norway, Fac Technol Nat Sci & Maritime Sci, Dept Sci & Ind Syst, Kongsberg, Norway",University College of Southeast Norway,"Nguyen, XPP (corresponding author), Univ South Eastern Norway, Fac Technol Nat Sci & Maritime Sci, Dept Sci & Ind Syst, Kongsberg, Norway.",nguyen.phan@usn.no; neno.ruseno@usn.no; fabio.chagas@usn.no; aurilla.bechina@usn.no,,,SESAR3 Joint Undertaking under European Union [101114805],SESAR3 Joint Undertaking under European Union,This work is part of the AI4HyDrop project financially supported by the SESAR3 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No. 101114805 under European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme.,,32,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2576-3555,,979-8-3503-7398-1; 979-8-3503-7397-4,INT C CONTROL DECISI,,,2024,,,,,,,2704,2710,,10.1109/CoDIT62066.2024.10708243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT62066.2024.10708243,,,7,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science,BX9GE,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001345039102124,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this era of digital construction, various information and communication technologies have been developed and deployed to the site for the management and control of construction activities including cost management. Irrespective of the benefits of adopting these technologies, most of them are still not readily accepted for use for construction management. This study articulated Seven (7) recent technologies driving the industry and evaluated their acceptance for cost management of construction projects. The technologies include mobile technology, Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Equipment (Drones and Robotics), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Predictive Analytics (PA). Data was gathered using a restructured questionnaire and technology acceptance model analysis was performed to identify which of the technologies have higher acceptance for cost management based on the criteria of availability, affordability, frequency of use, usefulness for cost management, and acceptance in the industry. Test statistics using Spearman's correlations and Kendall's correlations for each of the technologies and Spearman's Correlations of Technology acceptance with other variables in the TAM Model were performed. The results showed that mobile technology has higher correlation values than other technologies, and therefore has a higher acceptance for cost management. Kendall's coefficient of concordance values and Spearman's correlation values for Mobile technology were all above 0.6 which indicates a high level of agreement among the raters and strong relationships between the compared TAM variables.","[Igwe, Uchenna Sampson; Mohamed, Sarajul Fikri; Azwarie, Mohd Bin Mat Dzahir] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Alambina dan Ukur, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Ugulu, Rex Asibuodu] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Sch Environm Sci, Akure, Owerri Imo Stat, Nigeria; [Ajayi, Olusegun] Fed Polytech Nekede, Sch Environm Design & Technol, Akure, Owerri Imo Stat, Nigeria",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Igwe, US (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Alambina dan Ukur, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.",igwesampson36@gmail.com; sarajul@utm.my; mohdazwarie@utm.my; rexugulu@gmail.com,"Igwe, Uchenna/Q-5186-2018; Mohamed, Dr Sarajul/J-2500-2017; Ugulu, Rex/AAQ-4364-2021","Mohamed, Sarajul Fikri/0000-0002-0703-9288; Ugulu, Rex Asibuodu/0000-0002-9774-123X",Federal Government of Nigeria,Federal Government of Nigeria,"The authors would like to thank the Federal Government of Nigeria for providing the TETFUND scholarship that resulted in this paper, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria, for approving study leave fora Ph.d. study that resulted in this paper, and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for providing the enabling environment to carry out research.",,85,10,10,19,67,INT COUNCIL RESEARCH & INNOVATION BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION,ROTTERDAM,"KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS",1874-4753,,,J INF TECHNOL CONSTR,J.

The ESRIUM project, funded by the EU Horizon 2020 Programme, aims to address these challenges by developing digital maps representing road deterioration and employing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to generate infrastructure-assisted routing recommendations for CAVs. While the solutions for sending standardized safety messages and controlling enabled CAVs were demonstrated in the ESRIUM project, the solution for the automatic generation of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) safety messages was not studied. In this paper, we propose a pipeline named ConnectGPT, which connects Large Language Models (LLMs) with CAVs, utilizing GPT-4, to observe traffic conditions, identify conditions that can endanger the flow of traffic, and automate the generation of the corresponding standardized C-ITS messages, such as Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) about the actual safety problem.

The life cycle assessment method is adopted to analyse the environmental impact intensity, identify key link materials, and put forward targeted improvement and optimization schemes. The study found the LC system's comprehensive environmental impact (CEI) is smaller, which is 59.73% less than the AI system.

The pros of mystery calling include data from (near) authentic interactions, scalability, cost efficiency, and broad applicability. The cons include medium bias, rigidity, challenges with standardization, and possible consequences when participants learn of the minor deception. Yet, the telephone is not a stable technology, and we anticipate significant impacts from artificial intelligence (AI). Broadly, we anticipate that AI will make future mystery caller studies more dependent on machine-machine interactions, with the human playing more of a supervisory and editing role. In particular, AI will automate and expand functions related to data collection, data analysis, project management, and research reporting.

The aforementioned selection problem has been lagging behind other software-specific aspects of online knowledge platform and learning platform development so far. We linked technological recommendations from group decision support exercises to the platform design aims and constraints using an expert Delphi survey and multicriteria analysis methods. The links between expected advantages of using selected AI building tools, AI-related system functionalities, and their ongoing relevance until 2030 were assessed and used to optimize the learning scenarios and in planning the future development of the platform. The selected technologies allowed the platform management to implement the desired functionalities, thus harnessing the potential of open innovation platforms more effectively and delivering a model for the development of a relevant class of advanced open-access knowledge provision systems. Additionally, our approach is an essential part of digital sustainability and AI-alignment strategy for the aforementioned class of systems.

I show how these AI enhancements transform lie detection, followed with analyses as to how the changes can lead to moral problems. Specifically, I examine how these applications of AI introduce human rights issues of fairness, mental privacy, and bias and outline the implications of these changes for HR management. The changes that AI is making to lie detection are altering the roles of human test administrators and human subjects, adding machine learning-based AI agents to the situation and establishing invasive data collection processes as well as introducing certain biases in results. I project that the potentials for pervasive and continuous lie detection initiatives (truth machines) are substantial, displacing human-centered efforts to establish trust and foster integrity in organizations. I argue that if it is possible for HR managers to do so, they should cease using technologically-based lie detection systems entirely and work to foster trust and accountability on a human scale. However, if these AI-enhanced technologies are put into place by organizations by law, agency mandate, or other compulsory measures, care should be taken that the impacts of the technologies on human rights and wellbeing are considered. The article explores how AI can displace the human agent in some aspects of lie detection and credibility assessment scenarios, expanding the prospects for inscrutable, black box processes and novel physiological constructs (such as biomarkers of deceit) that may increase the potential for such human rights concerns as fairness, mental privacy, and bias. Employee interactions with autonomous lie detection systems rather with than human beings who administer specific tests can reframe organizational processes and rules concerning the assessment of personal honesty and integrity. The dystopian projection of organizational life in which analyses and judgments of the honesty of one's utterances are made automatically and in conjunction with one's personal profile provides unsettling prospects for the autonomy of self-representation.","[Oravec, Jo Ann] Univ Wisconsin Whitewater & Madison, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA",,"Oravec, JA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Whitewater & Madison, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",oravecj@uww.edu,"Oravec, Jo Ann/AGZ-5359-2022","Oravec, Jo Ann/0000-0003-1716-7969",,,,,86,16,18,12,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1388-1957,1572-8439,,ETHICS INF TECHNOL,Ethics Inf.

However, contractual construction disagreements (CCDs), such as conflicts, claims, and disputes, frequently arise between contractual parties, leading to additional costs, prolongation costs, liquidated damages, or extension of time, to name a few examples. Although prior studies offer some insights, there still needs to be a more comprehensive and systematic identification of different digital technologies useful to prevent, mitigate, or resolve CCDs. This study fills this gap by exploring two primary research questions: (1) What digital technologies have been identified to manage contractual disagreements in the AEC industry? (2) How might artificial intelligence (AI) facilitate the digitalization of contractual disagreement management in the AEC industry? This study followed a rigorous systematic review protocol and used the Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework to identify 82 peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2023. The findings demonstrated that AI, distributed ledger technologies, and building information modeling are the most dominant digital technologies in managing CCDs in the AEC industry. The study presents a conceptual framework that maps the benefits of AI and other digital solutions in facilitating conflict prevention, claim mitigation, and dispute resolution. The findings have valuable benefits for industry practitioners seeking to enhance CCD management. Moreover, the identified research avenues pave the way for future exploration and advancement of digital solutions in managing CCDs.","[Zeberga, Muluken Shibru; Haaskjold, Haavard; Hussein, Bassam] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Zeberga, MS (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",muluken.s.zeberga@ntnu.no; haavard.haaskjold@ntnu.no; bassam.hussein@ntnu.no,"HUSSEIN, BASSAM/AAA-6437-2019; Haaskjold, Haavard/AHB-8938-2022","Haaskjold, Haavard/0000-0002-3153-1635; Hussein, Bassam/0000-0003-0743-1316; Zeberga, Muluken/0009-0002-4270-1879",,,,,139,2,2,16,31,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

With the recent boom in digital innovation, AI is getting a bigger emphasis, brings new opportunities to tackle many issues within organizations and raises new challenges about its usage and limits. It is expected that more and more smart interconnected machines capable of situational awareness and independent decision-making will emerge. Large-scale projects are being launched all over the world including Hungary, for developing and applying automation and AI-based business solutions. AI and expert systems were already used in the fifties and later in the seventies and eighties, but results did not bring any breakthrough success. Thanks to technological development the situation has changed and many seemingly unsolvable problems (e.g. machine interpretation, facial recognition, diagnosis and prognosis of certain rare diseases) are progressing well. Beside human knowledge, machine and common human-machine knowledge play an increasing role, in addition to human creativity machine creativity gains ground. In the field of Knowledge Management (KM), both theoretically and practically important issues arise like how the development of technology affects KM or how AI can contribute to the organization of knowledge, and how it can facilitate and extend the future of knowledge workers. The research is intended to map the future of KM and knowledge workers in the light of the emergence of knowledge generated by emerging technologies. The research is carried out via qualitative methodology by conducting interviews that result in organizational case studies with respondents from various organizations operating in Hungary. Just as effective adaptation of KM and today's technological achievements play an essential role in the survival of companies, it can be a significant advantage if the knowledge created during application of emerging technologies is managed in some way.","[Obermayer, Nora; Toth, Viktoria Erika] Univ Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary",University of Pannonia,"Obermayer, N (corresponding author), Univ Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary.",obermayer.nora@gtk.uni-pannon.hu; totherikaviktoria@gmail.com,"Dr Obermayer, Nora/ABE-3958-2021",,"New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [UNKP-20-3]","New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund","Supported by the UNKP-20-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund.",,45,0,0,11,34,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-8963,,978-1-914587-07-8,PROC EUR CONF KNOWL,,,2021,,,,,,,585,593,,10.34190/EKM.21.055,http://dx.doi.org/10.34190/EKM.21.055,,,9,Business; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BS7BB,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000758201900069,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five major electronic databases were searched (Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, ACM, Web of Science), along with manual searches of gray literature, personal archives, and reference lists of relevant papers. All original studies as well as conference abstracts and proceedings, focusing on AI applications for pediatric chronic disease care were included. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. We extracted AI method used, study design, population, intervention, and main results. Two researchers independently extracted data and resolved discrepancies through discussion. AI applications are diverse, encompassing, e.g., disease classification, outcome prediction, or decision support. AI generally performed well, though most models were tested on retrospective data. AI-based tools have shown promise in mental health analysis, e.g., by using speech sampling or social media data to predict therapy outcomes for various chronic conditions.Conclusions: While AI holds potential in pediatric chronic disease care, most reviewed studies are small-scale research projects.

In addition, the project has shown that the scientific communities have a lot in common, can act as a single voice towards the funding agencies, the European Commission, and other key programmes such as the implementation of ESOC (European Open Science Cloud). Consequently, ESCAPE partners consider forming a long-term international open collaboration that would exist independently of specific project funding, that can maintain the synergistic aspects of the cluster scientific communities.

The recent global increase in the prevalence of myopia has been projected to lead to a higher incidence of pathologic myopia in the future. Thus, imaging myopic eyes to detect early pathological changes, or predict myopia progression to allow for early intervention, has become a key priority. Recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have contributed to the new grading system for myopic maculopathy and myopic traction maculopathy, which may improve phenotyping and thus, clinical management. Widefield fundus and OCT imaging has improved the detection of posterior staphyloma. Non-invasive OCT angiography has enabled depth-resolved imaging for myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great performance in detecting pathologic myopia and the identification of myopia-associated complications. These advances in imaging with adjunctive AI analysis may lead to improvements in monitoring disease progression or guiding treatments. In this review, we provide an update on the classification of pathologic myopia, how imaging has improved clinical evaluation and management of myopia-associated complications, and the recent development of AI algorithms to aid the detection and classification of pathologic myopia.","[Li, Yong; Foo, Li-Lian; Wong, Chee Wai; Li, Jonathan; Hoang, Quan, V; Schmetterer, Leopold; Ting, Daniel S.

One potential approach to address myopia and its complications is early detection and treatment. However, current healthcare systems may not be able to cope with the growing burden. Digital technological solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as a potential adjunct for myopia management. Recent findings There are currently four significant domains of AI in myopia, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), genetics and natural language processing (NLP). ML has been demonstrated to be a useful adjunctive for myopia prediction and biometry for cataract surgery in highly myopic individuals. DL techniques, particularly convoluted neural networks, have been applied to various image-related diagnostic and predictive solutions. Applications of AI in genomics and NLP appear to be at a nascent stage. Current AI research is mainly focused on disease classification and prediction in myopia. Through greater collaborative research, we envision AI will play an increasingly critical role in big data analysis by aggregating a greater variety of parameters including genomics and environmental factors. This may enable the development of generalizable adjunctive DL systems that could help realize predictive and individualized precision medicine for myopic patients.","[Foo, Li Lian; Ng, Wei Yan; Lim, Gilbert Yong San; Tan, Tien-En; Ang, Marcus; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei] Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Foo, Li Lian; Ng, Wei Yan; Ang, Marcus; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei] Natl Univ Singapore, Duke NUS Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Singapore National Eye Center; National University of Singapore,"Ting, DSW (corresponding author), Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, Singapore Eye Res Inst, Head Al & Digital Innovat, Singapore, Singapore.",daniel.ting45@gmail.com,"Lim, Gilbert/N-7322-2017; Cheng, Ching-Yu/Y-2229-2019; ANG, Marcus/D-2239-2010","Bidwai, Pooja Vishal/0000-0002-3077-4395",,,,,111,23,24,9,75,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-8738,1531-7021,,CURR OPIN OPHTHALMOL,Curr.

Nevertheless, the black-box nature of ML models obscures the reasoning behind predictions, undermining transparency and trust. To address this, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Global Priors-based LIME (G-LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have been applied to interpret black-box models. Yet, they face considerable limitations in PRM, including their inability to model cascading effects and multi-level dependencies among risk factors, suffering from inconsistencies due to random sampling, and failure to capture non-linear interactions in high-dimensional risk data. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes the Multi-Module eXplainable Artificial Intelligence framework for Project Risk Management (MMXAI-PRM), a novel approach designed to address the unique demands of PRM. The framework consists of three modules: the Risk Relationship Insight Module (RRIM), which models risk dependencies using a Knowledge Graph (KG); the Risk Factor Influence Analysis Module (RFIAM), which introduces a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-aided Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations using Kernel Ridge Regression (CTGAN-LIMEKR) to ensure explanation consistency and handle non-linearity; and the Visualization and Interpretation Module (VIM), which synthesizes these insights into an interpretable, chain-based representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMXAI-PRM delivers more consistent, stable, and accurate explanations than existing XAI methods. By improving interpretability, it enhances trust in AI-driven risk predictions and equips project managers with actionable insights, advancing decision-making in PRM.","[Badhon, Bodrunnessa; Chakrabortty, Ripon K.] UNSW, Sch Syst & Comp, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia; [Anavatti, Sreenatha G.] UNSW, Sch Engn & Technol, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia; [Vanhoucke, Mario] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ghent, Belgium; [Vanhoucke, Mario] Vlerick Business Sch, Operat & Technol Management Ctr, Ghent, Belgium; [Vanhoucke, Mario] UCL, UCL Sch Management, London, England",,"Badhon, B (corresponding author), UNSW, Sch Syst & Comp, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia.",b.badhon@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0952-1976,1873-6769,,ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL,Eng.

The targets for such 3GPP studies and standardization are to lower power consumed at user equipment (UE) and reference signal (RS) overhead that are currently needed by frequent beam measurements due to UE rotation and mobility. To meet such targets, in this paper, we investigate AI/ML based algorithms facilitating TD beam prediction suitable for 5G-Advanced beam management (BM), including RS receive power (RSRP) prediction and beam change prediction. The proposed AI/ML algorithms are first evaluated through computer simulations with new UE mobility models based on recent standard evolutions in 3GPP. Then we further present over-the-air test results achieved by such AI/ML algorithms, using based station (BS) and UE compliant with 3GPP standards. Evaluation results show that the proposed schemes can accurately predict future beams and reduce large amount of the power consumed at the UE for BM, which also demonstrate feasibility of AI/ML based BM for 5G-Advanced and future 6G communications.","[Li, Qiaoyu] Qualcomm Wireless Commun Technol China Ltd, Beijing 100013, Peoples R China; [Sisk, Philip; Kannan, Arumugam; Yoo, Taesang; Luo, Tao; Shah, Gaurav; Manjunath, Badri; Samarathungage, Chanaka; Boroujeni, Mahmoud Taherzadeh; Pezeshki, Hamed] Qualcomm Technol Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Joshi, Himanshu] Qualcomm Technol Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA",Qualcomm; Qualcomm; Qualcomm,"Li, QY (corresponding author), Qualcomm Wireless Commun Technol China Ltd, Beijing 100013, Peoples R China.",qiaoli@qti.qualcomm.com; psisk@qti.qualcomm.com; akannan@qti.qualcomm.com; taesangy@qti.qualcomm.com; tluo@qti.qualcomm.com; gshah@qti.qualcomm.com; bmanjuna@qti.qualcomm.com; csamarat@qti.qualcomm.com; mtaherza@qti.qualcomm.com; hamedp@qti.qualcomm.com; himanshu@qti.qualcomm.com,,,,,,,28,9,9,2,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0733-8716,1558-0008,,IEEE J SEL AREA COMM,IEEE J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems. Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (Al-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on Al-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on Al-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on Al-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the AEC industry.","[Darko, Amos; Chan, Albert P.

Furthermore, one of the key modalities that has been less explored, both from the algorithmic and practice point of view, is time-series. Several application domains involve time-series including Industry 4.0, asset monitoring, supply chain or finance to name a few. The AIX360 library (https://github.com/Trusted- AI/AIX360) has been incubated by the Linux Foundation AI & Data open-source projects and it has gained significant popularity: its public GitHub repository has over 1.3K stars and has been broadly adopted in the academic and applied settings. Motivated by industrial applications, large scale client projects and deployments in software products in the areas of IoT, asset management or supply chain, the AIX360 library has been recently expanded significantly to address the above challenges. AIX360 now includes new techniques including support for time-series modality introducing time series based explainers such as TS-LIME, TS Saliency explainer, TS-ICE and TS-SHAP. It also introduces improvements in generating model agnostic, consistent, diverse, and scalable explanations, and new algorithms for tabular data. In this hands-on tutorial, we provide an overview of the library with the focus on the latest additions, time series explainers and use cases such as forecasting, time series anomaly detection or classification, and hands-on demonstrations based on industrial use-cases selected to demonstrate practical challenges and how they are addressed. The audience will be able to evaluate different types of explanations with a focus on practical aspects motivated by real deployments.","[Ganapavarapu, Giridhar; Gil, Natalia Martinez; Sarpatwar, Kanthi; Dhurandhar, Amit; Vaculin, Roman] IBM Res, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Mukherjee, Sumanta] IBM Res, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; [Rajasekharan, Amaresh] IBM Software, Poughkeepsie, NY USA; [Arya, Vijay] IBM Res, Gurugram, Haryana, India",International Business Machines (IBM); IBM USA,"Ganapavarapu, G (corresponding author), IBM Res, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",giridhar.ganapavarapu@ibm.com; sumanm03@ibm.com; natalia.martinez.gil@ibm.com; sarpatwa@ibm.com; amaresh@us.ibm.com; adhuran@us.ibm.com; vijay.arya@ibm.com; vaculin@ibm.com,,"Dhurandhar, Amit/0000-0002-3579-1450; Sarpatwar, Kanthi/0000-0002-7737-1200; Martinez Gil, Natalia/0000-0003-1550-1046",,,,,15,1,1,3,5,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0103-0,,,,2023,,,,,,,5777,5778,,10.1145/3580305.3599182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3580305.3599182,,,2,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW2LZ,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001118896305072,View Full Record in Web of Science

Artificial intelligence (AI) enables efficient mimicry of bulk energy consumption control while producing results much faster than data-mining and machine learning models. This study proposes two AI based approaches for utilities bulk energy consumption prediction, control and management. Two different zones actual environmental and energy consumption data are obtained for input feature selection and modeling analysis. Each zone is categorized into five features parameter selection (PS) states. Each PS state is further divided into four different hidden neurons (HD) and hidden layers of the model's network. The forecasting duration is based on 1-month and 1-year ahead intervals for medium-term (MT) and long-term (LT) respectively. Further the current proposed model's performance is compared with three existing models. One of the promising findings in this research is that substantial improvement in prediction accuracy applying features extracted by PS-3 and PS-5.

This paper presents a novel integrated wind speed-power forecasting system (WSPFS) that operates across various time horizons, demonstrated through a case study in a high-wind area within the Middle East. The WSPFS leverages 12 AI algorithms both individual and ensemble models to forecast wind speed (WSF) and wind power (WPF) at intervals of 10 min to 36 h. A multi-horizon prediction approach is proposed, using WSF model outputs as inputs for WPF modeling. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean square error (MSE). Additionally, WSPFS advances the smart wind energy deep decarbonization (SWEDD) framework by calculating the carbon city index (CCI) to define the carbon-city transformation curve (CCTC).

The first application provides decision support by detecting blood glucose control problems and recommending therapeutic adjustments to correct them. The second provides an automated screen for excessive glycemic variability. The third aims to build a hypoglycemia predictor that could alert patients to dangerously low blood glucose levels in time to take preventive action.

Consequently, these innovative applications generate diverse, continuous, and rapidly evolving data transmission requirements that traditional network resource management struggles to satisfy in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we take a step beyond focusing solely on network-side traffic engineering efforts. Instead, we explore the potential of application-side traffic shaping within non-public networks to address these demanding transmission needs. Within the framework of optimizing Quality of Experience, we discuss on how the 5G-ERA project focuses on a multi-domain learning process for autonomous robotics using an intent-based networking approach for optimized resource management within the network validated by the use cases within the project enabling the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. Our central aim is to efficiently control and direct data traffic within the confines of the private network, ensuring it aligns with predefined objectives. While this methodology can be applied in various contexts, it is essential to establish precise intentions rooted in domain expertise.

Drawing from distinct qualitative research approaches, the DEDA framework was developed in an iterative process (2016-2018) and has since then been applied by various Dutch municipalities, the Association of Dutch Municipalities, and the Ministry of General Affairs (NL). We present the DEDA framework as an effective process to moderate case-deliberation and advance the development of responsible data practices. In addition, by thoroughly documenting the deliberation process, the DEDA framework establishes accountability. First, this paper sheds light on the necessity for data ethical case deliberation. Second, it describes the prototypes, the final design of the framework, and its evaluation. After a comparison with other frameworks, and a discussion of the findings, the paper concludes by arguing that the DEDA framework is a useful process for ethical evaluation of data projects for public management and an effective tool for creating awareness of ethical issues in data practices.","[Franzke, Aline Shakti] Univ Duisburg, Dept Polit Sci, Essen, Germany; [Muis, Iris; Schafer, Mirko Tobias] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Data Sch, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Duisburg Essen; Utrecht University,"Franzke, AS (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg, Dept Polit Sci, Essen, Germany.",aline.franzke@uni-due.de,"Franzke, Aline/GWZ-7849-2022","Franzke, Aline/0000-0001-7577-0964","Projekt DEAL; Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Utrecht Data School, University of Utrecht","Projekt DEAL; Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Utrecht Data School, University of Utrecht","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

In this study, the problem is defined as using the additive functional form in this process without testing additive independence (AI) assumption, which is one of the properties of multi-attribute utility theory. This study aims to emphasize the strength of the use of multiplicative functional forms when the multiplicative form is proven to be more appropriate by AI assumption test. To demonstrate this vital point, mathematical expressions are derived for the feasible regions of indifference curves. Then, the optimum region for both additive and multiplicative approaches are calculated using these analytical expressions to demonstrate the difference between the two relation to maximizing utility. This comparison is aimed at preventing suboptimal decisions because of the use of the additive approach when the multiplicative approach is more representative of the actual decision-making process. The relevance of this claim is also demonstrated using a simple hypothetical scenario. Findings of the paper provide valuable insights to decision makers and policy makers about the importance of choosing the most appropriate functional form for utility functions employed in a prioritization. We hope that policy makers at state departments of transportation will use the comparative analysis of the effect of utility functions on the final project selection process presented in this paper as part of their routine decision-making process.","[Kalan, Onur; Kurkcu, Abdullah; Ozbay, Kaan] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, C2SMART Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Kurkcu, Abdullah; Ozbay, Kaan] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress Cusp, Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Kalan, O (corresponding author), NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, C2SMART Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",ok22@nyu.edu,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

The larger study involved a total of 29,462 cows from 168 study herds. The project results demonstrate that reproductive performance varies widely between commercial dairy herds in Australia, suggesting there is considerable scope for improvement in many herds. The results also demonstrate that high-producing Australian dairy herds can achieve high 6-week in-calf rates. Using project results, six management areas currently limiting herd reproductive performance by important amounts in Australian dairy herds were identified. These are: . Calving spread (seasonal calving herds)/voluntary waiting period duration (year-round calving herds) . Heat detection rates . AI practice . Body condition pre-calving . Extent of negative energy balance in early lactation . Heifer liveweights pre-calving. Managers of Australian dairy herds planning to increase herd reproductive performance should assess management in these areas. The research phase of the project has provided an essential base for a national extension programme to improve herd reproductive performance. Based on research results, the project is now developing an extension programme focussed on and supporting herd manager decision-making.","Jemora Pty Ltd, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia",,"Morton, JM (corresponding author), Jemora Pty Ltd, 78 Henna St, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia.",,,,,,,,21,14,14,0,25,BRITISH CATTLE VETERINARY ASSOC,FRAMPTON-ON-SEVERN,"THE GREEN, FRAMPTON-ON-SEVERN GL2 7EP, GLOS, ENGLAND",0969-1251,,,CATTLE PRACT,Cattle Pract.,OCT,2003,11,,4,,,,201,208,,,,,,8,Veterinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Veterinary Sciences,746MD,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000186749400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

For intelligent applications leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), the Smart Product Backlog (SPB) has included both AI-implementable and non-AI functionalities. This paper had proposed a model employing supervised machine learning techniques to classify US descriptions based on their technical feasibility for AI implementation. This model had aimed to assist in constructing smart product backlogs (SPB). Classifying US in agile development, particularly with AI, had been a labor-intensive process demanding significant time and expert involvement. Additionally, the lack of a dedicated dataset for this task had limited the applicability of automated methods. This study addressed this challenge by having experts classify the Mendeley US dataset using binary classification (AI and non-AI). The proposal had involved developing an automatic classification model to process US descriptions and distinguish those suitable for AI implementation. This model had leveraged advanced text processing techniques to refine the textual features of the US. Additionally, it had employed three binary classification techniques: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVM). The model's performance had been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss (Log-Likelihood Loss), precision, recall, F1 score, area under the ROC curve, and specificity to identify the best-performing technique in binary classification. Logistic regression and SVM models had demonstrated high accuracy, with scores of 0.748 and 0.740, respectively. These results had highlighted the potential of an automated tool for recommending US feasible for AI development, thereby supporting decision-making in agile software projects.","[Gaona-Cuevas, Mauricio; Guerrero, Victor Bucheli] Univ Valle, Escuela Ingn Sistemas & Comp, Fac Ingn, Cali 760042, Colombia; [Vera-Rivera, Fredy H.] Univ Francisco Paula Santander, Dept Sistemas, Grp Invest Inteligencia Artificial GIA, Cucuta 546552, Colombia",Universidad del Valle; Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander,"Vera-Rivera, FH (corresponding author), Univ Francisco Paula Santander, Dept Sistemas, Grp Invest Inteligencia Artificial GIA, Cucuta 546552, Colombia.",fredyhumbertovera@ufps.edu.co,"Bucheli, Víctor/H-3881-2013","Vera-Rivera, F.

This article describes an NSF Convergence Accelerator project called SkillSync((TM)) in which multiple forms of AI are used to address this specific problem and provide national efforts (e.g., the US Chamber of Commerce Talent Pipeline Management initiative) with skills data and skills alignment services. Skillsync uses variations on the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder (SMITH) and other natural language understanding methods to map job descriptions and course information to skills taxonomies, uses machine-learned models to align skills needs with learning outcomes and training, and incorporates an intelligent coach based on Georgia Tech's Jill Watson virtual teaching assistant to answer questions about Skillsync's vocabulary, functionality, and process.

Despite the availability of effective lipid-reducing drugs, achieving the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels remains a significant challenge in clinical practice, contributing to persistently high rates of cardiovascular events. The intEgrated multidiscipliNary pathway for large-scale maNagement of dyslipidemiA in high-risk patients (ENNA) Project was designed to address the alarming rates of suboptimal lipid management in patients at high and very-high risk in the province of Enna, Sicily. This program aims to optimize LDL-C control through an integrated care model that fosters collaboration among pharmacists, general practitioners, and cardiologists, ultimately promoting a patient-centered approach to therapy. The patients who are eligible are identified using data-driven methods through prescription claims, laboratory results, and hospital discharge data, facilitated by local pharmacies. General practitioners play a crucial role as the primary care providers for initiating or optimizing lipid-reducing therapy, whereas cardiologists are involved in managing more complex cases requiring specialized intervention. The primary objective of the ENNA Project is to increase the percentage of patients at great risk in whom LDL-C targets are achieved, improving overall lipid management and therapeutic adherence.

These projects are moving forward with little or no knowledge of specific linkages between restoration actions and the responses of target species. Targeted effectiveness monitoring of these actions is required to redress this lack of mechanistic understanding, but such monitoring depends on detailed restoration information-that is, implementation monitoring. This article describes the process of assembling a database of restoration projects intended to improve stream and river habitat throughout the PNW. We designed the database specifically to address the needs of regional monitoring programs that evaluate the effectiveness of restoration actions. The database currently contains spatially referenced, project-level data on over 23,000 restoration actions initiated ai over 35,000 locations in the last 15 years (98% of projects report start or end dates between 1991 and 2005) in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Data sources included federal, state, local, nongovernmental organization, and tribal contributors. The process of database production identified difficulties in the design of regional project tracking systems. The technical design issues range from low-level information such as what defines a project or a location to high-level issues that include data validation and legalities of interagency data sharing. The completed database will inform efficient monitoring design, effectiveness assessments, and restoration project planning.","NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Ctr, Sci Data Management, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Idaho,"Katz, SL (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",steve.katz@noaa.gov,"Barnas, Katie/KRP-2340-2024; Katz, Stephen/KGL-4557-2024",,,,,,24,93,117,1,53,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

However, placing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a virtual world get making these environments both more interactive and more believable. One of the most ambitious goals of the AI is to create virtual worlds in which a big number of virtual characters or humans being interacted and behave in an autonomous way. For this purpose, placing embodied intelligence characters in a virtual world offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the AI concept. This paper introduces a Virtual Island developed in an innovative way based on fuzzy rules at the user interaction mechanism. We have used fuzzy tactics to create AI-based animals having various behavior types from an eagles' perspective which called 'Flight Simulation'. The simulation utilizes an eagle flying over the airspace of the Island of Chios. The AI on the ground is triggered by other animals when they enter a radius area with a certain speed defined in the software. It then decides how to behave according to health, behavior type and confidence level. Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature. Consequently, the used Fuzzy Tactics have been tested in realized Unity 3D simulation. The results of the study have proven that the virtual environment consisting AI-based animals has a good performance in terms of animal-user interactions and provided satisfactory results in run time.","[Turan, Ertan; Cetin, Gurcan] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Informat Syst Engn, Mugla, Turkey",Mugla Sitki Kocman University,"Çetin, G (corresponding author), Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Informat Syst Engn, Mugla, Turkey.",gcetin@mu.edu.tr,,,,,,,41,5,5,3,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-5489,1872-7018,,COMPUT STAND INTER,Comput.

The impact of this sector can be analysed from different perspectives, such as consumption of natural resources, waste generation, energy intensity, and environmental change. The sector is increasingly promoting using renewable materials, energy-efficient practices, and planning those respects ecological processes and biodiversity. Against this background, it is important to take coordinated action across the sector and move to net-zero carbon standards through immediate action to raise awareness, implement innovation, and improve carbon management and reporting processes. Tools supporting the reduction of the adverse impacts of construction activities include artificial intelligence tools. The construction industry has long been considered a conservative and traditional industry but is now experiencing a technological revolution. Gradually, artificial intelligence (AI) principles and tools are beginning to be integrated into the various lifecycle processes of construction projects. This paper analyses the AI tools used to analyse carbon footprinting in the construction sector in terms of selected functionalities.

With this in mind, we explore the concept of management of an IoT network of these heterogeneous devices and evaluate the path to follow, considering the components that already exist in the system. We use the Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) as a management protocol, even though it is recent and there was not a lot of information on its use in cyber-physical systems. To integrate this protocol into this innovative platform, we present two approaches. The first one is based on the Eclipse's Leshan project and the second works with FIWARE's LwM2M IoT Agent. Concerns about the energy consumption by the Raspberry Pi and the smartphone application with the protocol were raised, so performance tests were made, and the results were favorable.

Therefore, innovative financial products are required to develop projects that overcome these difficulties. Some issues must be considered when developing innovative financial products. An important problem in this process is that these features cannot possibly exist together in the new financial product, because each of these features incurs some costs. Therefore, identifying the most important features of innovative financial products is necessary. Accordingly, this study develops a new and innovative financial product to increase the effectiveness of investments in carbon capture technologies. For this purpose, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based fuzzy decision-making model is constructed. First, the weights of the experts were calculated by considering AI methodology. Second, the factors affecting investment in carbon capture technologies were weighted using a spherical fuzzy DEMATEL. Finally, the financial features required for investments were ranked using the spherical fuzzy ARAS method. This study's main contribution is its creation of a novel fuzzy decision-making model by integrating AI methodology with fuzzy decision-making theory. In this process, the weights of the experts are calculated using an AI approach. It is concluded that cost-effectiveness must be prioritized in the development of new financial products. Technological competence is another aspect that should be considered in this process. However, innovative financial products should include risk management and flexible financing.","[Yuksel, Serhat; Dincer, Hasan; Oflaz, Nihal Kalayci] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Business, TR-34817 Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Yuksel, Serhat; Dincer, Hasan] Khazar Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Eti, Serkan] Istanbul Medipol Univ, IMU Vocat Sch, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Gokalp, Yasar] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Hlth, TR-34817 Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Olaru, Gabriela Oana] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Commun, TR-34817 Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkiye",Istanbul Medipol University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Khazar University; Istanbul Medipol University; Istanbul Medipol University; Istanbul Medipol University,"Dinçer, H (corresponding author), Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Business, TR-34817 Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkiye.;Dinçer, H (corresponding author), Khazar Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baku, Azerbaijan.",serhatyuksel@medipol.edu.tr; seti@medipol.edu.tr; hdincer@medipol.edu.tr; ygokalp@medipol.edu.tr; gabriela.olaru@medipol.edu.tr; nkalayci@medipol.edu.tr,"OLARU, Gabriela Oana/IQX-0747-2023; Eti, Serkan/B-8836-2018; gökalp, yaşar/AEK-7226-2022; Dincer, Hasan/GPX-1316-2022","Dincer, Hasan/0000-0002-8072-031X",,,,,110,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2199-4730,,FINANC INNOV,Financ.

However, there are still many challenges to achieving this vision. The goal of this project was to develop and apply methods for enhancing chronic disease care using AI. Methods Using a dataset of 27,904 patients with diabetes, an analytical method was developed and validated for generating a treatment pathway graph which consists of models that predict the likelihood of alternate treatment strategies achieving care goals. An AI-driven clinical decision support system (CDSS) integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) was developed by encapsulating the prediction models in an OpenCDS Web service module and delivering the model outputs through a SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) web-based dashboard. This CDSS enables clinicians and patients to review relevant patient parameters, select treatment goals, and review alternate treatment strategies based on prediction results. Results The proposed analytical method outperformed previous machine-learning algorithms on prediction accuracy. The CDSS was successfully integrated with the Epic EHR at the University of Utah. Conclusion A predictive analytics-based CDSS was developed and successfully integrated with the EHR through standards-based interoperability frameworks. The approach used could potentially be applied to many other chronic conditions to bring AI-driven CDSS to the point of care.","[Tarumi, Shinji; Takeuchi, Wataru; Chalkidis, George; Ban, Hideyuki] Hitachi Ltd, Ctr Technol Innovat Artificial Intelligence, Dept Media Intelligent Proc Res, 1-280,Higashi Koigakubo, Kokubunji, Tokyo 1858601, Japan; [Rodriguez-Loya, Salvador; Weir, Charlene; Kramer, Heidi; Shields, David E.; Warner, Phillip B.; Kukhareva, Polina; Kawamoto, Kensaku] Univ Utah, Dept Biomed Informat, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Kuwata, Junichi] Hitachi Ltd, Ctr Social Innovat, Dept Prod Design, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan; [Flynn, Michael] Univ Utah, Dept Internal Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Flynn, Michael] Univ Utah, Dept Pediat, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Turner, Kyle M.] Univ Utah, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Sakaguchi, Farrant H.] Univ Utah, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Hitachi Limited; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Hitachi Limited; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Tarumi, S (corresponding author), Hitachi Ltd, Ctr Technol Innovat Artificial Intelligence, Dept Media Intelligent Proc Res, 1-280,Higashi Koigakubo, Kokubunji, Tokyo 1858601, Japan.",shinji.tarumi.xs@hitachi.com,"Kukhareva, Polina/AAW-4033-2020; Rodriguez-Loya, Salvador/AAO-6427-2021","Kukhareva, Polina/0000-0002-5576-1486; Rodriguez, Salvador/0000-0001-5672-1788","Hitachi, Ltd.","Hitachi, Ltd.","This work was supported by Hitachi, Ltd.",,46,28,28,9,48,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0026-1270,2511-705X,,METHOD INFORM MED,Methods Inf.

Several FL platforms and frameworks are being developed with various open datasets.

Since FL is composed of numerous clients and executed, it is necessary to manage the lifecycle such as model deployment and status management to multiple clients in order to operate FL. This study proposes FLScalize to enable AI researchers to apply their own custom data and models to FL environments and to deploy and manage the FL lifecycle. Researchers who develop these models should be able to easily and conveniently apply custom data and models developed in a centralized environment to FL environments, deploy and train multiple clients, and manage the lifecycle of the entire FL process. FLScalize can be used to simulate system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity, both of which are FL issues that occur in real FL environments. Furthermore, FLScalize provides a manager component that continuously manages the FL client and server required for real-world FL tasks and realizes an FL lifecycle management implementation that enables continuous integration, deployment, and training.","[Yang, Semo; Moon, Jihwan; Lee, Kangyoon] Gachon Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seongnam Si 13120, South Korea; [Kim, Jinsoo; Lee, Kwangkee] Innopia Technol Inc, Seongnam Si 13217, South Korea",Gachon University,"Lee, K (corresponding author), Gachon Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seongnam Si 13120, South Korea.",keylee@gachon.ac.kr,,"Lee, Kwangkee/0000-0001-5382-6912; Moon, JiHwan/0009-0005-3605-200X; Lee, KangYoon/0000-0003-3078-6166",Commercializations Promotion Agency for Research and Development Outcome (COMPA) - Korean Government (MSIT) through the Future Research Service Development Support [2022-1-SB4-1]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - MSIT [NRF-2022R1F1A1069069],"Commercializations Promotion Agency for Research and Development Outcome (COMPA) - Korean Government (MSIT) through the Future Research Service Development Support; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - MSIT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported in part by the Commercializations Promotion Agency for Research and Development Outcome (COMPA) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) through the Future Research Service Development Support under Grant 2022-1-SB4-1, and inpart by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by MSIT under Grant NRF-2022R1F1A1069069.",,29,5,5,1,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,47212,47222,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3275439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3275439,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,J5PK2,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001010133900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This invention is based on an innovative paradigm shift in human communication within organizations that function based on workflows or modern production cycles. The previous communication models like email or social media solutions such as Slack, Yammer and MS Teams fail in providing optimal communications due to the inherent flaws in their models. The current invention addresses these flaws by introducing a framework which focuses on the specific topics of interest or components of a product or project as they move through the production cycle or workflow. The result is a communication system which guarantees optimality with zero noise to information ratio. Recipients in this network are guaranteed to receive only messages directly relevant to them. Moreover, everyone in the team including ordinary stakeholders from `rank and file' can effortlessly monitor the status of and gain real time insight into their topics of interest as a direct benefit of this new model. Additionally, this same invention provides for a novel framework to incorporate Ai into every aspect of an organization's workflow in direct collaboration and assistance to the human resources in a seamless fashion. The latter can potentially have a profound impact on accelerating the trend of the merging of humans and AI within an organization's workflow.","[Alibakhsh, Massoud] Xeba Technol, Atlanta, GA 30339 USA",,"Alibakhsh, M (corresponding author), Xeba Technol, Atlanta, GA 30339 USA.",massoud@xeba.tech,,,,,,,5,0,0,2,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-5841-2,,,,2021,,,,,,,1451,1453,,10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00288,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00288,,,3,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT4NL,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000832229300260,View Full Record in Web of Science

First service conception rates were similar for the two groups of sires (46.3% for summarized and 45.6% for sampling sires). Services needed to produce a milking daughter averaged 6.65. There were no significant differences between the two groups of females for any of the reproductive or management factors studied. Although not significantly different, lactational yields tended to be higher for daughters of summarized versus sampling sires.

The question of how to promote awareness of ethical responsibilities in the context of AI in medical devices is raised, and the use of core frameworks for ethical and value-based design as well as reflexive practice are being evaluated. To this end we conducted multiple empirical studies based on multiple university research projects, including joint research with healthcare industry partners, connecting the fields of medicine, engineering psychology, media informatics, and design research. We present a questionnaire-based self-reflection tool-VaPeMeT-designed to encourage ethical reflection and use of frameworks across project phases and team members. Our studies combine qualitative and quantitative research in order to 1) connect reported participant actions with theoretical considerations from value-based design and 2) evaluate the completeness and usefulness of the VaPeMeT questionnaire.

Thus, it is crucial to forming project teams in an organization, in such a way that they will welcome AI in the decision-making process. The current technological revolution is demanding a rapid pace of change to companies and has increased the attention to the role of teams in fostering innovation adoption. We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources' cost and human-machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation.","[La Torre, Davide] Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis Campus, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Colapinto, Cinzia] Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Durosini, Ilaria; Triberti, Stefano] European Inst Oncol IRCCS, Appl Res Div Cognit & Psychol Sci, IEO, Via Giuseppe Ripamonti 435, I-20141 Milan, Italy; [Triberti, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dept Oncol & Hematooncol, Via Festa del Perdono 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy",SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; IRCCS European Institute of Oncology (IEO); University of Milan,"Colapinto, C (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",davide.latorre@skema.edu; cinzia.colapinto@unive.it; ilaria.durosini@ieo.it; stefano.triberti@unimi.it,"Triberti, Stefano/IAQ-0714-2023; Durosini, Ilaria/ABI-8214-2020; La Torre, Davide/AAB-7935-2022; La Torre, Davide/I-8207-2015","La Torre, Davide/0000-0003-2776-0037; Durosini, Ilaria/0000-0002-8500-2675; Triberti, Stefano/0000-0001-5691-5531",,,,,64,31,34,67,267,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

This scoping review takes a theoretical approach to examine the barriers and facilitators based on empirical data from existing implementations. We searched the major databases of relevant scientific publications for articles related to AI in clinical settings, published between 2015 and 2021. Based on the theoretical constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we used a deductive, followed by an inductive, approach to extract facilitators and barriers. After screening 2784 studies, 19 studies were included in this review. Most of the cited facilitators were related to engagement with and management of the implementation process, while the most cited barriers dealt with the intervention's generalizability and interoperability with existing systems, as well as the inner settings' data quality and availability. We noted per-study imbalances related to the reporting of the theoretic domains. Our findings suggest a greater need for implementation science expertise in AI implementation projects, to improve both the implementation process and the quality of scientific reporting.","[Chomutare, Taridzo; Tejedor, Miguel; Svenning, Therese Olsen; Marco-Ruiz, Luis; Tayefi, Maryam; Lind, Karianne; Godtliebsen, Fred; Moen, Anne; Makhlysheva, Alexandra; Phuong Dinh Ngo] Norwegian Ctr E Hlth Res, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Godtliebsen, Fred] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Moen, Anne] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Inst Hlth & Soc, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Ismail, Leila] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates; [Ismail, Leila] United Arab Emirates Univ, Natl Water & Energy Ctr, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates; [Ismail, Leila] Univ Melbourne, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Oslo; United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University; University of Melbourne,"Chomutare, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Ctr E Hlth Res, N-9019 Tromso, Norway.",taridzo.chomutare@ehealthresearch.no,"Ngo, Phuong/AAK-7338-2021; Marco-Ruiz, Luis/LPQ-6748-2024; Lind, Karianne Fredenfeldt/A-3578-2015; Ismail, Leila/Y-4172-2019","Svenning, Therese/0000-0002-0552-2145; Makhlysheva, Alexandra/0000-0002-0106-1951; Moen, Anne/0000-0002-3825-9355; Ngo, Phuong/0000-0002-0057-8801; Lind, Karianne Fredenfeldt/0000-0001-9187-1706; Marco-Ruiz, Luis/0000-0001-6349-3162; Ismail, Leila/0000-0003-0946-1818",,,,,56,41,41,5,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The methodology incorporates support vector regression (SVR) to gather input data on key soil parameters, and the output data from SVR are used as inputs for additional machine learning techniques such as Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. Evaluation of Artificial Intelligent techniques shows that the XGBoost model outperforms others, exhibiting high accuracy and reliability with low mean square error and high correlation coefficient. The effectiveness of the XGBoost model has implications for soil management, agricultural productivity, and land suitability evaluations, particularly for renewable energy projects. By integrating advanced AI techniques, stakeholders can make informed decisions about land use planning, sustainable farming practices, and the feasibility of renewable energy installations. Overall, this research contributes to soil science by demonstrating the potential of AI techniques, specifically the XGBoost model, in accurately predicting soil compaction and supporting optimal soil management practices.","[Hassan, Marwa; Beshr, Eman] Arab Acad Sci & Technol, Elect & Control Dept, Cairo 11799, Egypt","Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research & Technology (ASRT); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport","Hassan, M (corresponding author), Arab Acad Sci & Technol, Elect & Control Dept, Cairo 11799, Egypt.",eng_marwa@aast.edu,"Hassan, Marwa/I-5324-2019",,"Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)(Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB))","Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).",,57,1,1,1,3,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,FEB 5,2024,14,1,,,,,,,2924,10.1038/s41598-024-52702-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52702-3,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,D3X4I,38316847,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001295546600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore this question in more detail, we investigate three seminal projects that Deutsche Bank completed with the crowdworking platform Jovoto and that aimed at exploring AI trends and developing concepts for the future of banking. We derive measures necessary for the successful management of complex work systems and provide a model as guidance for both companies and crowdworking platform operators.

Maintenance IoT solutions sometimes fail to be introduced into actual operations even though the technology trial is successfully completed. To avoid such situations, the customer cocreation method has been introduced into maintenance IoT projects. However, the knowledge and interest gaps between maintenance and IoT companies prevent the discussion. In this research, we introduce our maintenance service menu, which contains various ideas for maintenance improvements and connects maintenance improvements and IoT solution sets. We also introduce a new customer cocreation method based on the service menu.

Due to the unpredictability and dependence on the weather, integrating renewable energy sources (RES) is a viable option for distributed distribution (DG). To minimize environmental impact and meet the increasing energy demand-supply gap, scientists need to find alternative energy sources. Several studies have confirmed that HES is economically viable in remote areas, particularly in off-grid applications. Despite several improvements over the past few years, existing HES control systems are complex, costly, less reliable, and not sufficiently efficient. The purpose of this paper is to present the most common challenges faced by stand-alone hybrid energy systems and how the artificial intelligence (AI) technique has improved them. AI techniques are widely used in HES, and this study addressed how AI can solve classification, forecasting, networking, optimization, and control problems. This study provides an overview of the recent history of HES critical challenges in energy management, sizing, demand side management, and storage management; additionally, we have addressed several conceptual/theoretical problems, antecedents, and consequences that may be of interest or require further research. Companies must ensure their systems perform effectively and pay for their investments. Regardless of the system, failures and defects should be diagnosed and repaired as soon as possible. This can be achieved by increasing the system's efficiency and preventing early -stage damage. Researchers and project managers who work on hybrid systems will find this paper to be an invaluable resource.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional image-based medical services such as radiology and diagnostic consultation can now fully utilize multimedia technologies to provide novel services, including remote cooperative medical triage, distributed virtual simulation of operations, as well as cross-country collaborative medical research and training. Fast (efficient) and easy (flexible) retrieval of relevant images remains a critical requirement for the provision of remote medical services. This paper describes the database system requirements and presents a system architecture of a distributed multimedia database system, MISSION-DBS, which has been designed to fulfill the goals of Project MISSION (medical imaging support via satellite integrated optical network)-an experimental high performance gigabit satellite communication network linking remote supercomputing power, medical image databases, and 3D visualization capabilities, in addition to medical expertise anywhere and anytime around the globe, The MISSION-DBS design employs a synergistic fusion of techniques in distributed databases (DDB) and artificial intelligence (AI) for storing, migrating, accessing, and exploring images. The efficient storage and retrieval of voluminous image information is achieved by integrating DDB modeling and AI techniques for image processing while the flexible retrieval mechanisms are accomplished by combining attribute-based and content-based retrievals.

Composition of the committee Members of a scientific planning committee provided guidance alongside members of a CFPC staff advisory committee, led by the CFPC-AMS TechForward Fellow and including CFPC, FM, and AI leaders. Methods This initiative included 2 projects. First, an environmental scan of published and gray literature on AI for FM produced between 2018 and 2022 was completed. Second, an invitational round table held in April 2022 brought together AI and FM experts and leaders to discuss priorities and to create a strategy for the future. Report The environmental scan identified research related to 5 major domains of application in FM (preventive care and risk profiling, physician decision support, operational efficiencies, patient self -management, and population health). Although there had been little testing or evaluation of AI -based tools in practice settings, progress since previous reviews has been made in engaging stakeholders to identify key considerations about AI for FM and opportunities in the field. The round -table discussions further emphasized barriers to and facilitators of high -quality research; they also indicated that while there is immense potential for AI to benefit FM practice, the current research trajectory needs to change, and greater support is needed to achieve these expected benefits and to avoid harm. Conclusion Ten candidate action items that the CFPC could adopt to support near -term positive progress in the field were identified, some of which an AI working group has begun pursuing. Candidate action items are roughly divided into avenues where the CFPC is well -suited to take a leadership role in tackling priority issues in AI for FM research and specific activities or initiatives the CFPC could complete. Strong FM leadership is needed to advance AI research that will contribute to positive transformation in FM.","[Kueper, Jacqueline K.] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, ON, Canada; [Emu, Mahzabeen; Choudhury, Salimur] Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Banbury, Mark] Coll Family Phys Canada, Informat & Technol Serv, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Bjerre, Lise M.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bjerre, Lise M.] Inst Savoir Montfort, Family Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Green, Michael] Queens Univ, Dept Family Med, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Green, Michael; Slade, Steve] Coll Family Phys Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Pimlott, Nicholas] Univ Toronto, Temerty Fac Med, Dept Family & Community Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tsuei, Sian H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Family Practice, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tsuei, Sian H.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Sisler, Jeff] Coll Family Phys Canada, Profess Dev & Practice Support, Mississauga, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Queens University - Canada; University of Ottawa; Queens University - Canada; University of Toronto; University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University,"Banbury, M (corresponding author), Coll Family Phys Canada, Informat & Technol Serv, Mississauga, ON, Canada.",mbanbury@cfpc.ca,,,Foundation for Advancing Family Medicine; AMS Healthcare; Mitacs through the Business Strategy Internship,Foundation for Advancing Family Medicine; AMS Healthcare; Mitacs through the Business Strategy Internship,"We thank the participants of the Artificial Intelligence for Family Medicine Research in Canada Round Table, who provided their expertise, time, and energy to help increase knowledge around the current state and future directions of this field; the list of participants is available from CFPlus.* Several CFPC staff were involved in the planning and execution of this project; we especially thank Andre Girouard, Liza Santos, and Cheri Nickel.

This scenario often leads to models that are overfitted and redundant processes. Therefore, data science needs to have clear goals and strategies in place. Especially when the low barrier to entry results in fewer feasibility studies, which, unfortunately, often produce poor data results. It is crucial to Regularize AI, assess practicality, and select techniques carefully to execute successful projects. Lack of sufficient data can result in bias and false positives. Thus, each case requires a careful analysis to choose the appropriate methods, algorithms, and frameworks. This paper emphasizes the importance of training intelligent models by exploring the potential of generative AI to enable models to learn problem-solving from existing knowledge. The text delves into the complexities of global data exchange through theoretical frameworks such as GDPR to guide data privacy and cybersecurity. It suggests solutions like VPNs and the significance of data quality and infrastructure through discussions on data lakes, big data, and data pipelines. There is also an emphasis on various model training techniques and common challenges in neural network training. The paper also underscores the importance of ongoing analysis and adaptation in a fast-paced world. It explores data management solutions and values user input and feedback. Suggestions include efficient practices andAI recommendations via data economy, standards, and regulations to reduce pre-work and analysis time. Innovations such as IoT, distributed computing, and AI-friendly databases are crucial for model training. It attempts to show how analysis and pre-work lay the foundation for continuous improvement by providing examples of modulated architectures and emphasizing the link between research and product value.

Design/methodology/approach The AI technique employed in this paper is the deep neural network (DNN) model, which has been successfully applied to a wide variety of decision-making tasks. The authors examine the ability of the classic ordinary least squares (OLS) and the DNN models to describe the effects of abnormal audit fees on accounting quality based on recent research that demonstrates a systematic link between accruals-based earnings management and abnormal audit fees. Thus, the authors seek to imply that their new method provides a more precise estimate of abnormal audit fees. Findings The findings indicate that abnormal audit fees projected using the DNN model are substantially more accurate than those estimated using the classic OLS model in terms of their association with earnings management. Specifically, when abnormal audit fees predicted using the DNN rather than the OLS are incorporated in the accruals-based earnings management model, the adjusted R(2)s are larger. Additionally, the DNN-estimated coefficient of abnormal audit fees is more favorably associated to earnings management than the classic OLS-estimated coefficient. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the DNN outperforms OLS in terms of explanatory power in a negative discretionary accruals subsample and a Big 4 auditor subsample. Finally, abnormal audit fees projected using the DNN method provide a better explanation for audit hours than those estimated using the OLS model. Originality/value This is the first approach that utilized a machine learning technology to estimate abnormal audit fees. Because more precise measurement yields more credible research results, the findings of this study imply a significant advancement in calculating unusually higher audit fees.","[Choi, Seung Uk] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Kun Chang] Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, SAIHST Samsung Adv Inst Hlth Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Na, Hyung Jong] Semyung Univ, Sch Global Business, Jecheon, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Semyung University,"Lee, KC (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, SAIHST Samsung Adv Inst Hlth Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea.",kunchanglee@gmail.com,"Choi, Sung-Uk/G-8547-2012; Lee, Kang/A-9556-2010","Lee, Kun Chang/0000-0003-4286-052X",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A5A2A01046529],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A5A2A01046529).,,37,4,5,9,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0025-1747,1758-6070,,MANAGE DECIS,Manag.

Previous research on machine learning (ML) applications for delay predictions has mainly been concerned with delays on a whole project level, whereas predictions of delays in individual project activities have received less attention. This study is a pilot study to investigate how data from large project databases can be used for an ML analysis. The application is aimed at providing early warnings of delays related to VOs in construction projects. The study was performed following typical ML model development steps including data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and testing. A compound dataset was retrieved from project-planning software utilised in a large project. Four pilot tree-based ML models, namely, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, were trained and tested on a pre-processed dataset comprising 11194 activities. The overall best-performing model was Random Forest with 92.7% and 91.8% recall on DELAYED START and DELAYED FINISH, respectively. By emphasizing that project participants' competency and personal accountability might influence the timely implementation of scope adjustments, these findings advance the field of project management research. An approach like the use of tree-based ML algorithms is applicable for analyses of individual activities in other construction projects. Considering the capability of ML algorithms to capture complex interconnections in raw data extracted from project-planning software, further development of such ML models will enable the establishment of an AI-based Early Warning System (EWS) that can flag potential delays caused by VO requests.","[Nishat, Mirza Muntasir; Neraas, Sander Magnussen; Marsov, Andrei; Olsson, Nils O.

In Taiwan, greenhouse cultivation, a key agricultural method, faces increasing summer temperatures and higher operational costs. This study presents the innovative AI-powered greenhouse environmental control system (AI-GECS), which integrates customized gridded weather forecasts, microclimate forecasts, crop physiological indicators, and automated greenhouse operations. This system utilizes a Multi-Model Super Ensemble (MMSE) forecasting framework to generate accurate hourly gridded weather forecasts. Building upon these forecasts, combined with real-time in-greenhouse meteorological data, the AI-GECS employs a hybrid deep learning model, CLSTM-CNN-BP, to project the greenhouse's microclimate on an hourly basis. This predictive capability allows for the assessment of crop physiological indicators within the anticipated microclimate, thereby enabling preemptive adjustments to cooling systems to mitigate adverse conditions. All processes run on a cloud-based platform, automating operations for enhanced environmental control. The AI-GECS was tested in an experimental greenhouse at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, showing strong alignment with greenhouse management needs. This system offers a resource-efficient, labor-saving solution, fusing microclimate forecasts with crop models to support sustainable agriculture.

An example,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,decision support system; modeling; adaptation; portability; genetic algorithm,,"Information in the area of developing transportable decision support systems (DSSs) (agricultural or otherwise) has been scarce. Therefore, developers of DSSs have had some difficulties in constructing DSSs which could be widely used. In the first part of this two-part paper series, a conceptual framework was introduced which proposes methods for making DSSs transportable. This framework serves as a checklist and includes recommendations about general implementation, user interaction, data management, and model aspects. To illustrate the implementation of these recommendations, the development of a DSS within a project called SYBIL is discussed in detail. Therein, portable and public domain tools have been used to build the DSS with a graphical user interface (GUI) which satisfies the general implementation aspects of the framework. Further, the development of a flexible data management system has been essential in the project so that different types of data can be easily handled without changing the models. In order to allow models embedded within the DSS to be successfully transported between regions, a novel artificial intelligence (AI) adaptation methodology was implemented. The main component of this adaptation methodology is a genetic algorithm (GA), an AI search technique. By linking a GA to an agricultural model, the model becomes more robust because the model is able to adapt to the region in which it is being used. Overall, by using the framework criteria to select/create these tools/components, the DSS has been made easy to transport and disseminate.","UNIV TRENT, DIPARTIMENTO INFORMAT & STUDI AZIENDALI, LAB INGN INFORMAT, I-38068 ROVERETO, TRENTO, ITALY; UNIV PHOENIX, DTP FAC, ENGLEWOOD, CO 80111 USA",University of Trento; University of Phoenix,,,,,,,,,15,1,1,2,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

There exist various models to evaluate the digitalization potential of a company and to define the maturity level of a company in exploiting digitalization technologies summarized under buzzwords such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). While platforms, protocols, patterns, technical implementations, and standards are in place to adopt these technologies, small-to mediumsized enterprises (SME) still struggle with digitalization. This is because it is hard to identify the most beneficial projects with manageable cost, limited resources and restricted know-how. In the present paper, we describe a real-life project where digitalization use cases have been identified, evaluated, and prioritized with respect to benefits and costs. This effort led to a portfolio of projects, some with quick and easy wins and some others with mid-to long-term benefits. From our experiences, we extracted a general approach that could be useful for other SMEs to identify concrete digitalization activities and to define projects implementing their digital transformation.

The 3 D reconstruction deep learning model is first introduced, and then the model idea of the construction progress reliability control system is designed based on BIM (building information model). Second, the construction process of the 4dbim model is described, and the construction method is introduced. The construction of the model provides data information for the construction schedule reliability control system. Finally, the three functional modules of progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction are realized by combining the S-curve comparison method, and the work of the system is described through case simulation. The early warning result is from June 7 to June 11, the progress deviation is between (-2%, 2%), and the progress is basically controlled. On June 13, the planned workload was 81.099%, and the actual cumulative workload was 7.099%, which was 4% less than the planned workload. The project progress was out of date, so it needs to be closely tracked. On June 15, the planned workload was 85.511%, and the actual cumulative workload was 80.899%, 4.5% less than the planned workload. The forecast result is the line forecast of the actual cumulative completion percentage on June 17. After calculation, the forecast result on June 17 is 84.311%. The progress deviation on June 17 was 5.21%. If no timely delay is taken on June 15, the delay will get worse. In addition, the system can predict the completion period of the project. When the actual percentage of cumulative completion is greater than or equal to 100%, it indicates that the project has been completed. Therefore, we can calculate the completion period of the three-storey project, and the construction period is about June 29 or 30. When the simulation can be carried out, the simulation number is set as 1000 times, the completion probability of the project is only 40%, and the completion probability is not too high. Artificial intelligence technology can realize progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction. This system model prepares for software development and is conducive to improving the progress reliability control level of construction enterprises. Starting from the schedule planning subsystem and the schedule control subsystem, this paper studies the application of the artificial intelligence technology based on deep learning in the modeling of a building construction management system. The results show that this technology can effectively improve the efficiency of the building construction schedule management. Compared with the existing management methods, it shows great advantages in terms of operating costs and ease of use. It also promotes the application of artificial intelligence technology in the construction phase.","[Wang, Hongbo] Guangdong Engn Polytech, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yan] Guangzhou Metro Design & Res Inst Co Ltd, Guangzhou 510010, Peoples R China",,"Wang, HB (corresponding author), Guangdong Engn Polytech, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China.",j12021215@st.sandau.edu.cn; huyangcgs@163.com,,,,,,,23,8,8,2,25,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-5680,1687-5699,,ADV MULTIMED,Adv.

Learners are encouraged to take charge of their learning and, often the opportunity to independently design their learning experience. This research illustrates the use of technology in teaching and learning technology with a central theme of promoting self-directed learning with engaging self-design for both educators and learners. The technology used includes existing tools such as web page design, Learning Management Systems (LMS), project management tools, and basic programming foundations and concepts of big data and databases. In addition, end-users and developers can create their own tools with simple coding. Planning techniques, such as Visual Plan Construct Language with its embedded AI, are used to integrate course material and rubrics with time management. Educators may use project management tools instead. The research proposes a self-directed paradigm with self-designed resources using the existing technology with LMS modules, discussions, and self-tests. The research establishes its criteria for ensuring the quality of content and design, known as 7x2C. Additionally, other criteria for analysis, such as Design Thinking, are included. The approach is examined for a technology-based business course in creating an experiential learning system for COVID-19 awareness. Likewise, among other projects, an environment for educating learners about diabetes and obesity has been designed. The project is known as Sunchoke, which has a theme of Grow, Eat, and Heal.

The project is led by the General Directorate for Teacher Training and Educational Innovation (DGFPIE) of the Ministry of Education and Sports (CED), and its main objective is the consolidation of the Digital Educational Transformation in Andalusia (TDE), focusing on the optimisation of services to grant the best use of the resources. The project' strategy is fully aligned with the EU's Digital Education Action Plan, upon a global, collaborative and inclusive approach, making emphasis in granting universal access to resources and services to all the groups of the Educational Community. Once high connectivity is provided to schools, the project is defined around three action lines that consolidate the TDE ecosystem of the DGFPIE: Improving the use of digital technology in teaching-learning processes Developing digital competencies and skills relevant to the educational community Promoting the improvement of school results and reduction of dropout through Big Data (BD), Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The project methodologies cover technological, implementation and dissemination aspects, and consist of adaptations of gap analysis, design thinking, Lean IT, BPM and TOGAF for the definition phase, scrum for the development and ITIL, PMP and OPPM services provision and project management. Regarding implementation and dissemination, any new service provided is tested in a piloting phase prior to its go alive, with a defined piloting methodology. The result, the Andalusian Digital Education Ecosystem is a personalized teaching-learning environment that provides access to a digital classroom, integrated with the backoffice management system, which allows class organization and planning, connected with the digital content of publishers and with an open educational resources banks (LOR). This pedagogical support is complemented with services to promote the digital training of students, families and teachers through a MOOC, MoocEdu, fully aligned with the DigCompX frameworks. A Digital Proficiency Test is included to diagnose the user skills and stablish a starting point, recommending training actions to achieve the defined objectives. Through this single access point, schools benefit from facilities to collaborate which include a vast community of school blogs and classroom spaces, BlogsAverroes, ever growing to support communication needs for different decision-making bodies within the CED. AI allows the provision of a Pedagogical Assessment Service, a personalized and contextualized educational reinforcement of the students through recommendations of itineraries, contents, tasks and/or readings adapted to their academic situation, which take into account information related to the characteristics of their teachers, their socioeconomic context and their academic performance, among others. The project results are measured by means of access and use indicators, which together with the user's satisfaction, checked by the change management service, establish the conclusions and the basis for the continuous improvement of the TDE ecosystem.","[Segura, A.; Agromayor, J.

Tasks such as classifying BIM objects, indexing them with meta-data (e.g., category), and searching digital libraries to load objects into models still plague practice with inefficient manual workflows. This research aims to improve the productivity of BIM content management and retrieval by developing an AI-backed BIM content recommender system. Using data from a case-study firm, this research extracted content from over 30,000 technical BIM views (e.g., plans, sections, details) in historical projects to build an unsupervised machine-learning prototype with association rule mining. This prototype explicated the strength of relationships among co-occurring BIM objects. Using this prototype as the backbone AI-engine in live BIM sessions, this research developed a context-aware recommender system that dynamically provides BIM users with a set of objects associable with their modeling context (e.g., type of view, existing objects in the model) and human-computer interactions (e.g., objects selected by the user). By mining association data from hundreds of historical projects, this development marks a departure from the existing prototypes that rely on explicit coding, recurring user input, or subjective ratings to recommend BIM content to users. The simulation and experimental implementation of this recommender system yielded high efficacy in predicting content needs and achieved significant savings in the time spent on conventional BIM workflows.","[Abdirad, Hamid] DPR Construct, 315 2nd Ave S Ste 200, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Mathur, Pegah] North Carolina State Univ, 50 Pullen Rd, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA",North Carolina State University,"Abdirad, H (corresponding author), DPR Construct, 315 2nd Ave S Ste 200, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",hamida@dpr.com; pmathur2@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,55,20,22,14,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1474-0346,1873-5320,,ADV ENG INFORM,Adv.

An overview of AI considering the methodological dilemma of focusing only on positive experiences is discussed. Findings from focus group discussions in a post-1992 UK university are presented that demonstrate AI's efficacy as a developmental pedagogic research approach. This AI research was part of the wider UK retention and success project, 'What Works?', which aimed to support first year undergraduates' belonging during HE transition in order to enhance their engagement, retention and success. These focus groups explored first year undergraduates' experiences of learning, teaching, assessment and support, incorporating retention interventions in Business, Social Science and Digital Media courses. Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and capital and Wenger's community of practice model are applied as an analytical lens to illuminate the role of structure and agency relating to students' experiences. The findings show how AI focus groups were a way for participants to explore and discuss positive perceptions and experiences of starting university. They also enabled participants to discuss problems, solutions, and ways to enhance pedagogy and support, contributing to educational development at course, institutional and sector-wide levels. We argue that embracing the 'shadow' (Fitzgerald, S. P., Oliver, C., & Hoxsey, J. C. (2010). Appreciative inquiry as a shadow process.Journal of Management Inquiry,19(3), 220-233) in AI is a commitment that should be shared by a variety of stakeholders in order to gain a holistic understanding of what is needed to facilitate transformative change in HE development.","[Jones, Jennifer; Masika, Rachel] Univ Brighton, Ctr Learning & Teaching, Watson Bldg, Falmer BN1 9PH, Sussex, England",University of Brighton,"Masika, R (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Ctr Learning & Teaching, Watson Bldg, Falmer BN1 9PH, Sussex, England.",r.j.masika@brighton.ac.uk,"Masika, Rachel/D-6754-2014","Masika, Rachel/0000-0002-7505-528X; Jones, Jennifer/0000-0002-5654-6550",,,,,33,6,6,7,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0729-4360,1469-8366,,HIGH EDUC RES DEV,High.

Transformative learning is more effective when learners are engaged mentally and behaviorally in learning experiences. Correspondingly, the conflict management training approach involved a three-step procedure consisting of a learning phase, a practice phase enabled by an LLM, and a reflection phase. Fifty-six students enrolled in a systems development course were exposed to the transformative learning approach to conflict management so they would be better prepared to address any potential conflicts within their teams as they approached a semester-long software development project. The study investigated the following: (1) How did the training and practice affect students' level of confidence in addressing conflict? (2) Which conflict management styles did students use in the simulated practice? (3) Which strategies did students employ when engaging with the simulated conflict? The findings indicate that: (1) 65% of the students significantly increased in confidence in managing conflict by demonstrating collaborative, compromising, and accommodative approaches; (2) 26% of the students slightly increased in confidence by implementing collaborative and accommodative approaches; and (3) 9% of the students did not increase in confidence, as they were already confident in applying collaborative approaches. The three most frequently used strategies for managing conflict were identifying the root cause of the problem, actively listening, and being specific and objective in explaining their concerns.","[Aggrawal, Sakhi] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Magana, Alejandra J.] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Magana, Alejandra J.] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Magana, AJ (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.;Magana, AJ (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",saggrawa@purdue.edu; admagana@purdue.edu,"Magana, Alejandra/W-2852-2019; Aggrawal, Sakhi/JLM-2662-2023","Magana, Alejandra/0000-0001-6117-7502; Aggrawal, Sakhi/0000-0002-2274-0152",US National Science Foundation; Purdue University; Protect Purdue Innovations Faculty Grant; [2113991]; [2219271],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Purdue University; Protect Purdue Innovations Faculty Grant; ;,"The authors would like to thank the US National Science Foundation for their support through the award numbers #2113991 and #2219271, and Purdue University for their support through a Protect Purdue Innovations Faculty Grant.

This project assesses the relationship between cultural identity and markers of mental health and well-being for AI/AN adolescents. Adolescents 12 to 18 years old from the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina participated in this mixed-methods study. Phase 1, discussed in this manuscript, involved surveys using validated instruments to assess cultural connection and markers of mental health and well-being. Characteristics of the 122 AI/AN youth who completed the survey included: mean age 14.9 years (SD = 2.0); 61% (n = 75) assigned female at birth; 56% (n = 70) identified as female; and 4.1% (n = 5) identified as non-binary. Mean tribal affiliation (TA) and ethnic identity (EI) scores suggest strong cultural connection (TA: M = 3.1/5, SD = 0.6; EI: M = 3.4/5, SD = 0.9). Sleep quality (M = 2.63/5) and positive stress management (M = 2.06/5) were low. Bivariate and logistic regression demonstrated moderate positive correlations between EI and friendship, EI and emotional support, TA and friendship, and TA and emotional support. AI/AN adolescents in this sample have a moderate-strong connection with Native culture, marked by ethnic identity and tribal affiliation, and positive markers of mental health and well-being.

In response to the UTM challenge, a decision support system (DSS) has been developed to help ATM personnel and aircraft pilots cope with their heavy workloads and challenging airspace situations. The DSS provides airspace situational awareness (ASA) driven by knowledge representation and reasoning from an Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO), which is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) database that augments humans' mental processes by means of implementing AI cognition. Ontologies for avionics have also been of interest to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) project, but they have yet to be received by practitioners and industry. This paper presents a decision-making computer tool to support ATM personnel and aviators in deciding on airspace situations. It details the AAO and the analytical AI foundations that support such an ontology. An application example and experimental test results from a UAV AAO (U-AAO) framework prototype are also presented. The AAO-based DSS can provide ASA from outdoor park-testing trials based on downscaled application scenarios that replicate takeoffs where drones play the role of different aircraft, i.e., where a drone represents an airplane that takes off and other drones represent AUVs flying around during the airplane's takeoff. The resulting ASA is the output of an AI cognitive process, the inputs of which are the aircraft localization based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and the classification of airplanes and UAVs (both represented by drones), the proximity between aircraft, and the knowledge of potential hazards from airspace situations involving the aircraft. The ASA outcomes are shown to augment the human ability to make decisions.","[Insaurralde, Carlos C.] Univ West England, Bristol Robot Lab, Bristol BS16 1QY, England; [Blasch, Erik] MOVEJ Analyt, Fairborn, OH 45324 USA",University of Bristol; University of West England,"Insaurralde, CC (corresponding author), Univ West England, Bristol Robot Lab, Bristol BS16 1QY, England.",carlos.c.insaurralde@gmx.com,,"Blasch, Erik/0000-0001-6894-6108",,,,,51,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2226-4310,,AEROSPACE-BASEL,Aerospace,NOV,2024,11,11,,,,,,,942,10.3390/aerospace11110942,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/aerospace11110942,,,33,"Engineering, Aerospace",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,N3U2S,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001363622700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, the potential impact of generative AI tools on higher education has been intensively debated. ChatGPT can generate well-formulated human-like text passages and conversations that is often, but not always, of a surprisingly high quality. This paper reports on an early experiment to explore ways in which ChatGPT can be used in the higher education context. The experiment involved a written assignment which required postgraduate Information Systems students to formulate a critique of the outputs of ChatGPT to a specific question in Information Systems project management. The paper investigates the level of criticality that the students demonstrated in working with ChatGPT and assessing the quality of its outputs. It further explores the claim that ChatGPT can be used to generate rubrics and assess students' assignments by asking ChatGPT to produce a rubric for critical thinking and assess the students' assignments against the rubric produced. The findings indicate that students perceive the ChatGPT produced responses as generally accurate, although they tend to lack depth, with some key information omitted, produced biased responses and have limitations with academic writing conventions. The rubric that ChatGPT produced for assessing critical thinking is lacking in certain areas and the reliability of using it as an assessment tool is questionable given the inconsistency in the results. Overall, the paper concludes that while ChatGPT and other text generative AI can be useful learning and teaching companions for both students and lectures, human expertise and judgement is needed in working with ChatGPT.","[Huang, Cheng-Wen; Coleman, Max; Gachago, Daniela; Van Belle, Jean-Paul] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Van Belle, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa.",jean-paul.vanbelle@uct.ac.za,"Huang, Cheng-Wen/AER-7315-2022","Van Belle, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-9140-0143; Huang, Cheng-Wen/0000-0001-9776-1786",,,,,20,0,0,44,47,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-031-48535-0; 978-3-031-48536-7,COMM COM INF SC,,,2024,1862,,,,,,105,118,,10.1007/978-3-031-48536-7_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-48536-7_8,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BX2KD,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001262321100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we predicted the risk of establishment and number of generations for P. absoluta in the current and future climatic conditions under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) of the years 2050 and 2070 using insect life cycle modelling (ILCYM) software. We used a temperature-dependent phenology model to project three risk indices viz., establishment risk index (ERI), generation index (GI), and activity index (AI) based on temperature data. The model projected large suitable areas for P. absoluta establishment in the Southern hemisphere under current and future climatic scenarios, compared to the Northern part. However, the risk of P. absoluta is expected to increase in Europe, USA, Southern Africa, and some parts of Asia in the future. Under current conditions, P. absoluta can complete between 6 and 16 generations per year in suitable areas. However, an increase in GI between 1 and 3 per year is projected for most parts of the world in the future, with an increase in AI between 1 and 4. Our results provide information on the risk of establishment of P. absoluta which could guide decision-makers to develop control strategies adapted for specific agro-ecological zones.","[Azrag, Abdelmutalab G.

The solution collects data from users' devices, explicit users' inputs, or from the external environment (e.g., facts of the world), and interacts with users by using a goal-based metaphor. Persuasive dialogues are used for proposing persuasion goals to users that, through a mobile application, are able to provide the required information and to receive contextual motivational messages helping them to achieve the proposed goals. In this paper, we focus on how behavioral change strategies have been exploited for providing a personalized support concerning the adoption of healthy lifestyle or the management of their chronic diseases based on the results of personal data processing. Such results are produced by reasoning operations, briefly mentioned in this paper, and coded into motivational strategies and messages by a dialogue-based persuasive layer. This layer manages dialogues and generates persuasive messages based on (i) the information provided by the reasoner, (ii) the user's behavior and profile, and (iii) the implemented behavioral change strategies. This way, messages are tailored to specific users. HORUS.AI has been validated within the context of the Key To Health project. Results demonstrated how the use of proposed approach supported users about improving their habits from the health perspectives as well as the overall good acceptability of the system by the users involved in the pilot study. Finally, the analysis of system's efficiency shows how HORUS.AI can be deployed within a real-world scenarios.","[Donadello, Ivan] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, KRDB Res Ctr, Bolzano, Italy; [Dragoni, Mauro] Fdn Bruno Kessler, Via Sommar 18, I-38123 Trento, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Fondazione Bruno Kessler,"Dragoni, M (corresponding author), Fdn Bruno Kessler, Via Sommar 18, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",ivan.donadello@unibz.it; dragoni@fbk.eu,"donadello, ivan/Y-5533-2019","Dragoni, Mauro/0000-0003-0380-6571",,,,,73,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",1869-5450,1869-5469,,SOC NETW ANAL MIN,Soc.

Yet, little is known regarding these associations among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. Thus, we examined the association of diabetes, hypertension, and CVD with all-cause dementia among AI/ANs aged 65 years and older. Method This was a cross-sectional analysis of the Indian Health Service Improving Health Care Delivery Data Project. Our study population was a 1:1 matched sample of 4 074 AI/ANs aged 65 years and older and Indian Health Service active users during fiscal year 2013. We employed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes for all-cause dementia, hypertension, and CVD. Diabetes was measured with a validated algorithm to identify adults with diabetes that uses diagnoses, laboratory test results, and medication criteria. Results Multivariable analyses revealed that diabetes and CVD were associated with increased odds of all-cause dementia and hypertension was not. Cardiovascular disease types associated with all-cause dementia differed with cerebrovascular disease having the strongest association. Analyses stratified by gender revealed that diabetes and CVD were associated with increased odds of all-cause dementia for women and only CVD was associated with all-cause dementia for men. Conclusions Training and support of primary care clinicians, addressing cultural considerations, and ensuring inclusion of AI/ANs in research are steps that could help meet AI/AN people's needs. Our findings underscore to the importance of improved management and control of diabetes and CVD, which may lead to the prevention of dementia among older AI/ANs.","[Goins, R.

This paper shows that the scheduling engine used effects the project duration even for relatively small projects consisting of a few dozen tasks, and the effect can become enormous as the number of tasks grows into the thousands and a number of types and quantity of resources expands. Unfortunately, the type of algorithm used by most commercial project planning software for handling resources, is a relatively inefficient methodology for scheduling resource constrained projects.(1,2) Project schedules can be either resource constrained or non-resource constrained. When a project plan is developed (e.g., in Microsoft Project) first the tasks and the durations are entered with the technical/temporal dependencies between the tasks. At this point the project plan can be used as is, or the actual resources that are needed to perform the tasks, i.e., people, machinery, floor space, etc. can be entered to give a more realistic depiction of the project. The resource constrained scheduling that will be discussed, is resource constrained Critical Path Project Management. Mathematically the resource constrained scheduling problem can be shown to be very complex, and for projects of any realistic size the globally optimum solution can not be guaranteed to be found in less than geological time even on the fastest computers. Therefore, many branches of science and engineering from operations research to artificial intelligence have developed techniques to find relatively optimum solutions in realistic timeframes. Unfortunately, most commercial project management software does not benefit from advanced scheduling technology. This paper reviews some of the literature on this topic showing different techniques and results showing the major difference in schedule duration due to the scheduling engine. Many lessons will be drawn from Stottler Henke's own work in this area. Since the early 1990s, Stottler Henke has been working with NASA and other companies to develop advanced scheduling technologies using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other techniques. This planning and scheduling technology has evolved into commercial grade software that is now used by NASA, the United Space Alliance, Boeing and others for complex scheduling applications. These include manifest planning for maintenance of the Space Shuttles after they return from space missions and Critical Chain Project Management for the final assembly of the Boeing 787 aircraft.","[Kalton, Annaka; Richards, Robert A.] SHAI, San Mateo, CA 94404 USA",,"Kalton, A (corresponding author), SHAI, San Mateo, CA 94404 USA.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1095-323X,,978-1-4244-1487-1,AEROSP CONF PROC,,,2008,,,,,,,4527,4535,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BIC00,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000258321202147,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response to the global Monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak, the HeHealth.ai team leveraged an existing tool to screen for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) to develop a digital screening test for symptomatic Mpox using AI. Before the global Mpox outbreak, the team developed a smartphone app (HeHealth) where app users can use a smartphone to photograph their own penises to screen for symptomatic STD. The AI model initially used 5000 cases and a modified convolutional neural network to output prediction scores across visually diagnosable penis pathologies including syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus. A total of about 22,000 users had downloaded the HeHealth app, and similar to 21,000 images were analysed using HeHealth AI technology. We then used formative research, stakeholder engagement, rapid consolidation images, a validation study, and implementation of the tool. A total of 1000 Mpox-related images had been used to train the Mpox symptom checker tool. Based on an internal validation, our digital symptom checker tool showed specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 90% for symptomatic Mpox. Several hurdles identified included issues of data privacy and security for app users, initial lack of data to train the AI tool, and the potential generalisability of input data. We offer several suggestions to help others get started on similar projects in emergency situations, including engaging a wide range of stakeholders, having a multidisciplinary team, prioritising pragmatism, as well as the concept that 'big data' in fact is made up of 'small data'.","[Tan, Rayner Kay Jin] 2 Sci Dr 2,MD1 Tahir Fdn Bldg 10-01, Singapore 117549, Singapore; [Tan, Rayner Kay Jin; Perera, Dilruk] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Tan, Rayner Kay Jin; Perera, Dilruk] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Tan, Rayner Kay Jin; Perera, Dilruk; Arasaratnam, Salomi; Kularathne, Yudara] HeHealth Ai, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Tan, RKJ (corresponding author), 2 Sci Dr 2,MD1 Tahir Fdn Bldg 10-01, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",Rayner.tan@nus.edu.sg,,"Tan, Rayner Kay Jin/0000-0002-9188-3368",HeHealth,HeHealth,This study was funded by HeHealth.,,14,3,3,2,7,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON SOUTH,"Private Bag 10, CLAYTON SOUTH, VIC 3169, AUSTRALIA",1448-5028,1449-8987,,SEX HEALTH,Sex Health,,2024,21,3,,,,,,,SH23197,10.1071/SH23197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SH23197,,,7,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",QP9B6,38743839,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001222180600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herbicides are an important tool for suppressing weed competition for initial seedling growth and removing exotic species in native plant communities. Little information is available on which species of native plants can endure a pre-emergent application of the imidazolinone herbicides. In spring 2006, we initiated a study testing responses of three native grasses and three native forbs to pre-emergent treatments of 0.035 kg ai/ha imazapic, 0.07 kg ai/ha imazapic, and 0.07 kg ai/ha imazapyr. Seedling establishment was monitored at 5 and 14 months after treatment and weed cover was monitored at 2.5, 5 and 14 months after treatment. There were no differences in the number of seedlings found in the untreated plots compared to all the herbicide-treated plots and there were no differences in seedling densities of green needlegrass (Nassella viridula) with the exception of the high imazapic treatment. Showy tick trefoil (Desmodium canadense) and Canada milk vetch (Astragalus crassicarpus) also appear to be able to tolerate applications of all herbicide treatments. There was less weed cover in the herbicide-treated plots when compared to the untreated control plots. This information provides managers options to include these species in initial seeding or restoration projects using these herbicides which may increase diversity and reduce restoration projects cost in the long term.","[Bahm, Matt A.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, Brookings, SD 57006 USA; [Barnes, Thomas G.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA",South Dakota State University; University of Kentucky,"Bahm, MA (corresponding author), Sequoia Natl Pk, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA.",bahm.matt@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,15,19,1,25,NATURAL AREAS ASSOC,ROCKFORD,"320 SOUTH THIRD ST, ROCKFORD, IL 61104 USA",0885-8608,2162-4399,,NAT AREA J,Nat.

Considering the involvement of human-based reasoning, this study proposes to use Fuzzy Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The risks were identified from the literature and subsequently, using 40 interviews with practitioners, the final list is developed on the basis of the presence of risks in the AI procurement process. For Fuzzy FMECA, the input data is collected from fifteen experts. The values of Severity (S), and Detection (D) for each risk element are averaged to use as input. If-Then rule-based fuzzy inference system is employed to obtain the Fuzzy Risk Priority Numbers of risk elements. The traditional RPN and Fuzzy RPN numbers are compared and it is found that fuzzy RPN gives a realistic picture of the ranking of risks. Privacy and security risks, Integration Risks, Risk of Malfunction of systems/services, and Ethical risks are found to be high priorities. This study provides valuable insight to policymakers to develop strategies to mitigate these risks for smooth procurement and implementation of AI-related Projects.","[Alshehhi, Khalid; Cheaitou, Ali; Rashid, Hamad] Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Alshehhi, K (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.",,"Rashid, Hamad/JFB-1730-2023",,,,,,47,1,1,1,2,SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD,WEST YORKSHIRE,"19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",2158-107X,2156-5570,,INT J ADV COMPUT SC,Int.

In OR we aspire to be logical, and therefore our behaviours should be relatively easy to replicate in logic, the basis of computer systems. We also pride ourselves on our attention to context, our project management skills, and our pragmatic approach. To think about the issues, we can turn to our experience of practicing OR and to the insights of mathematics, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Mathematicians and philosophers have widened the scope of logic to cover many aspects of decision-making; sociologists have conducted research into the social context and consequences of new technologies and economists have analysed their rates of penetration. Some OR jobs will be destroyed and others will be created giving rise to new, more varied career paths. The paper concludes that the centre of gravity of OR practice will move from analysis to those aspects difficult to computerise, the 'residuals'. When AI does finally displace OR practitioners, it may come in the form of 'AI strong enough for OR', strong enough to satisfy potential OR clients in terms of efficacy and cost. The OR community needs to get involved more deeply in AI; it has the relevant expertise to do so.","[Ormerod, Richard] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Ormerod, R (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",ormerodrichard@gmail.com,,,,,,,133,4,4,4,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-5682,1476-9360,,J OPER RES SOC,J.

Answer-set Programming (ASP) is used in many areas, among them are industrial optimisation, knowledge management or life sciences, and thus of great interest in the context of explainability. To ensure the successful application of ASP as a problem-solving paradigm in the future, it is thus crucial to investigate explanations for ASP solutions. Such an explanation generally tries to give an answer to the question of why something is, respectively is not, part of the decision produced or solution to the formulated problem. Although several explanation approaches for ASP exist, almost all of them lack support for certain language features that are used in practice. Most notably, this encompasses the various ASP extensions that have been developed in the recent years to enable reasoning over theories, external computations, or neural networks. This project aims to fill some of these gaps and contribute to the state of the art in explainable ASP. We tackle this by extending the language support of existing approaches but also by the development of novel explanation formalisms, like contrastive explanations.","[Geibinger, Tobias] TU Wien, Inst Log & Computat, Knowledge Based Syst Grp, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Geibinger, T (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Log & Computat, Knowledge Based Syst Grp, Vienna, Austria.",tobias.geibinger@tuwien.ac.at,"Geibinger, Tobias/LKL-7585-2024",,,,,,38,0,0,0,0,OPEN PUBL ASSOC,SYDNEY,"OPEN PUBL ASSOC, SYDNEY, 00000, AUSTRALIA",2075-2180,,,ELECTRON P THEOR COM,Electron.

The aim is to predict future skills requirements and match them with existing interorganizational skills. Companies are required to anticipate changes in markets, industries, and technologies at an early stage as well as to identify changes in job profiles within an occupational profile by tapping into and evaluating various data sources. Based on these findings, they can then make informed decisions regarding skill gaps, for example, to implement targeted further training measures. Forecasting-based skills management offers the opportunity to optimally qualify employees for constantly changing tasks. At the same time, however, the targeted development of such skills requires a high level of time, financial and personnel resources, which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally do not have at their disposal. In addition, many SMEs are not yet aware of the importance of this issue. Within the framework of research and industrial projects of the Smart Work department at the FIR (Institute for Industrial Management) at the RWTH Aachen University, an AI-based skills forecasting tool will be developed. The goal of the paper is to conceptualize the future machine learning method, that is able to generate individualized skills forecasts and recommendations for SMEs. This is achieved by linking societal forecasts and sector trends with company-specific conditions and skills. In order to generate a corresponding database, the derivation system is made available to various companies (large companies and SMEs) in order to obtain as many data sets as possible. The data sets obtained via the derivation system are then used as training data sets for the machine learning method, with the help of which an automatic derivation of competencies depending on new trends is to be made possible.","[Frierson, Charlotte; Wrobel, Jana; Senderek, Roman; Stich, Volker] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, FIR Inst Ind Management, Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Frierson, C (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, FIR Inst Ind Management, Aachen, Germany.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,2,2,Inst Production and Logistics Research GbR Herberger & Hubner,Offenburg,"Senator-Burda-Strasse 31a, Offenburg, GERMANY",2701-6277,,,Con Prod Sys Logisti,,,2023,,,,,,,801,811,,10.15488/13499,http://dx.doi.org/10.15488/13499,,,11,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BX5VD,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001304065500078,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, the implementation of AI in the context of power generation is addressed, focusing on achieving power generation at minimum wind velocity and classifying turbine faults using AI techniques. The researchers have proposed a novel generating unit which is going to generate 1 KW of electric power at a specific flow rate of air and the generated power will be stored in the battery bank through the charge controller and then the load is driven from the battery through an inverter. Iron or core losses (Hysteresis, Eddy Current losses) can be acknowledged as one of the major reasons for the inefficiency of conventional generators, therefore anovel coreless model generator was proposed which also improved efficiency and reduces drag. Wind Turbine prototype was fabricated and deployed for the testing and validation of the proposed novel design. The design produced outstanding power ratings and electrical generation characteristics compared with other existing strategies at minimal air flow. Results proved that the proposed coreless axial flux generator has the capability to produce a better power rating compared with the existing wind turbine generators. Proposed Axial flux achieved 10.73 watt power at wind velocity at around 80 rpm. At a wind velocity of 10 m/s and around 800 rpm 313-330 kwh was produced by the proposed generator while the conventional generator produced around 300 kwh. The proposed generator design performed 35% better in terms of production efficiency under load and no load conditions. Moreover, faults in turbines are very common due to the various temperatures, therefore the faults have been classified using state-of-the-art AI-based classifiers. A comparison of space vector modulation (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers was performed in the study to classify wind turbine faults. It was found that both classifiers performed well in achieving high accuracy. SVM achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 0.9861 compared with Naive Bayes, which achieved an accuracy of 0.967. Based on the results, it can be inferred that SVM may be a more suitable classifier for wind turbine fault classification. The case study results demonstrated the potential of AI applications in PBL education, offering students a multidisciplinary learning experience that enhances their technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and teamwork abilities.","[Khan, Talha Ahmed; Alam, Muhammad; Mazliham, M.

Background Handoffs can result in threats to patient safety and an atmosphere of distrust and blaming among staff can be engendered. As the majority of handoffs go well, an alternative is to build on successful handoffs. Evaluation The AI methodology was used to discover what was currently working well in unit to unit transfers. The data from semi-structured interviews that were conducted with staff, patients, and family informed structural process improvements. Key issues Themes extracted from the interviews focused on the situational variables necessary for the perfect transfer, the mode and content of transfer-related communication, and important factors in communication with the patient and family. Conclusions This project was successful in demonstrating the usefulness of AI as both a quality improvement methodology and a strategy to build trust among key stakeholders.

Prior works have proposed various AIOps solutions to support different tasks in system operations and maintenance, such as anomaly detection. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of open-source AIOps projects to understand the characteristics of AIOps in practice. We first carefully identify a set of AIOps projects from GitHub and analyze their repository metrics (e.g., the used programming languages). Then, we qualitatively examine the projects to understand their input data, analysis techniques, and goals. Finally, we assess the quality of these projects using different quality metrics, such as the number of bugs. To provide context, we also sample two sets of baseline projects from GitHub: a random sample of machine learning projects and a random sample of general-purposed projects. By comparing different metrics between our identified AIOps projects and these baselines, we derive meaningful insights. Our results reveal a recent and growing interest in AIOps solutions. However, the quality metrics indicate that AIOps projects suffer from more issues than our baseline projects. We also pinpoint the most common issues in AIOps approaches and discuss potential solutions to address these challenges. Our findings offer valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners, enabling them to comprehend the current state of AIOps practices and shed light on different ways of improving AIOps' weaker aspects. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first attempt to characterize open-source AIOps projects.","[Aghili, Roozbeh; Li, Heng; Khomh, Foutse] Polytech Montreal, Dept Comp Engn & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Aghili, R (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Dept Comp Engn & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",roozbeh.aghili@polymtl.ca; heng.li@polymtl.ca; foutse.khomh@polymtl.ca,,"Aghili, Roozbeh/0000-0002-9361-2369",,,,,111,4,4,6,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1382-3256,1573-7616,,EMPIR SOFTW ENG,Empir.

MVP-CHAMPION aimed to leverage DOE data scientists with expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and DOE world class supercomputer resources with the well-established clinical research infrastructure, the clinical and epidemiologic experts in VA, and the VA world class MVP genetic resource linked to a paperless, longitudinal, electronic health record encompassing over 25 million individuals. Two years were required to navigate regulatory, project management, and technical issues with complex interdependencies and to find a common language among the diverse investigator teams. Since then, the 79.6 million dollar program has been highly productive. MVP-CHAMPION has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. This supported a ground-breaking analysis of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants and resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art AI including large language natural language processing and a system biology-based collaboration focused on opioid addiction which received the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease. Predictive models developed are being evaluated for clinical management. Eight new projects were launched in 2023. Funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and for supporting research projects by joint VA-DOE research teams are now needed.","[Justice, Amy C.] VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, 950 Campbell Ave,Bldg 35A, West Haven, CT 06541 USA; [Justice, Amy C.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Med & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [McMahon, Benjamin] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Madduri, Ravi] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Crivelli, Silvia] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Damrauer, Scott] Univ Penn, Penn Heart & Vasc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cho, Kelly] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Ramoni, Rachel] Dept Vet Affairs, Off Res & Dev, Vet Hlth Adm, Washington, DC 20571 USA; [Muralidhar, Sumitra] Dept Vet Affairs, Mill Vet Program, Vet Hlth Adm, Washington, DC 20420 USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Connecticut Healthcare System; Yale University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Pennsylvania; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Boston Healthcare System; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Veterans Health Administration Office of Research & Development; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA),"Justice, AC (corresponding author), VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, 950 Campbell Ave,Bldg 35A, West Haven, CT 06541 USA.",amy.justice2@va.gov,"Justice, Amy/AFR-6951-2022","Cho, Kelly/0000-0003-1727-7076; Justice, Amy/0000-0003-0139-5502","Million Veteran Program - Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration [MVP000]; Knowledge Discovery Infrastructure (KDI) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-000R22725]","Million Veteran Program - Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration; Knowledge Discovery Infrastructure (KDI) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Million Veteran Program (MVP000) funded by the Office of Research and Development, Veterans Health Administration.

Patients access services through booked appointments and walk-in visits, with walk-in visits often facing longer waiting times. No-show appointments are significant contributors to inefficiency in PHC operations, which can lead to an estimated 3%-14% revenue loss, disrupt resource allocation, and negatively impact health care quality. Emirates Health Services (EHS) PHC centers handle over 140,000 visits monthly. Baseline data indicate a 21% no-show rate and an average patient wait time exceeding 16 minutes, necessitating an advanced scheduling and resource management system to enhance patient experiences and operational efficiency. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution that was integrated with an interactive real-time data dashboard on reducing no-show appointments and improving patient waiting times at the EHS PHCs. Methods: This study introduced an innovative AI-based data application to enhance PHC efficiency. Leveraging our electronic health record system, we deployed an AI model with an 86% accuracy rate to predict no-shows by analyzing historical data and categorizing appointments based on no-show risk. The model was integrated with a real-time dashboard to monitor patient journeys and wait times. Clinic coordinators used the dashboard to proactively manage high-risk appointments and optimize resource allocation. The intervention was assessed through a before-and-after comparison of PHC appointment dynamics and wait times, analyzing data from 135,393 appointments (67,429 before implementation and 67,964 after implementation). Results: Implementation of the AI-powered no-show prediction model resulted in a significant 50.7% reduction in no-show rates (P<.001). The odds ratio for no-shows after implementation was 0.43 (95% CI 0.42-0.45; P <.001), indicating a 57% reduction in the likelihood of no-shows. Additionally, patient wait times decreased by an average of 5.7 minutes overall (P<.001), with some PHCs achieving up to a 50% reduction in wait times. Conclusions: This project demonstrates that integrating AI with a data analytics platform and an electronic health record systems can significantly improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction in PHC settings. The AI model enabled daily assessments of wait times and allowed for real-time adjustments, such as reallocating patients to different clinicians, thus reducing wait times and optimizing resource use. These findings illustrate the transformative potential of AI and real-time data analytics in health care delivery.","[Alserkal, Yousif Mohamed; Ibrahim, Naseem Mohamed; Alsereidi, Aisha Suhail; Ibrahim, Mubaraka] Emirates Hlth Serv, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Kurakula, Sudheer; Naqvi, Sadaf Ahsan; Khan, Yasir; Oottumadathil, Neema Preman] Oracle, Edge Bldg,Al Falak St,Dubai Internet City, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Naqvi, SA (corresponding author), Oracle, Edge Bldg,Al Falak St,Dubai Internet City, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",sadaf.naqvi@oracle.com,,"Khan, Yasir/0000-0003-2134-0963; Naqvi, Sadaf/0000-0002-7105-5266",Emirates Health Services,Emirates Health Services,"Acknowledgments We would like to acknowledge Benjamin Vinodson.

This paper presents a system-of-systems performance-based asset risk management approach, designed to integrate various elements for effective investment prioritization and infrastructure resilience. Central to this approach are an Asset Inventory Database and a Risk Registry Database, supported by a Common Reference Location System (GIS). These components are the foundation for analytical modules to assess vulnerability and resilience based on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The approach includes an actionable framework to support a proactive data-driven performance-based management process for prioritizing investments. The project prioritization process consists of four steps: identifying risk factors, integrating climate data, conducting advanced risk assessments, and project prioritization. The goal is to prioritize resource allocation and develop climate-adaptive risk mitigation management strategies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are recommended for setting goals, monitoring the outcomes of these strategies, and measuring their benefits. A Climate Impact Vulnerability Score (CIVS) is proposed to assess the susceptibility of infrastructure assets to environmental conditions. The approach also leverages artificial intelligence (AI) tools to analyze roadway infrastructure vulnerabilities and climate risk exposure. A case study applied to bridges using k-means clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) demonstrates the potential of advanced analytical methods in improving decision-making. This research concludes that the approach will contribute to enhancing resource allocation, supporting strategic decisions, aligning goals with budgets prioritizing investments, and strengthening the resilience and sustainability of roadway infrastructure.","[Chang, Carlos M.; Hossain, Abid] Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Chang, CM (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA.",cachang@fiu.edu; ahoss019@fiu.edu,,,,,,,50,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2412-3811,,INFRASTRUCTURES-BASE,Infrastructures-Basel,DEC,2024,9,12,,,,,,,226,10.3390/infrastructures9120226,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures9120226,,,28,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation,Q4S1G,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001384588600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are substantial barriers that challenge health technology assessment (HTA) professionals to use AI-generated evidence for decision-making from large real-world databases (e.g., based on claims data). As part of the European Commission-funded HTx H2020 (Next Generation Health Technology Assessment) project, we aimed to put forward recommendations to support healthcare decision-makers in integrating AI into the HTA processes. The barriers, addressed by the paper, are particularly focusing on Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, where the implementation of HTA and access to health databases lag behind Western European countries. MethodsWe constructed a survey to rank the barriers to using AI for HTA purposes, completed by respondents from CEE jurisdictions with expertise in HTA. Using the results, two members of the HTx consortium from CEE developed recommendations on the most critical barriers. Then these recommendations were discussed in a workshop by a wider group of experts, including HTA and reimbursement decision-makers from both CEE countries and Western European countries, and summarized in a consensus report. ResultsRecommendations have been developed to address the top 15 barriers in areas of (1) human factor-related barriers, focusing on educating HTA doers and users, establishing collaborations and best practice sharing; (2) regulatory and policy-related barriers, proposing increasing awareness and political commitment and improving the management of sensitive information for AI use; (3) data-related barriers, suggesting enhancing standardization and collaboration with data networks, managing missing and unstructured data, using analytical and statistical approaches to address bias, using quality assessment tools and quality standards, improving reporting, and developing better conditions for the use of data; and (4) technological barriers, suggesting sustainable development of AI infrastructure. ConclusionIn the field of HTA, the great potential of AI to support evidence generation and evaluation has not yet been sufficiently explored and realized. Raising awareness of the intended and unintended consequences of AI-based methods and encouraging political commitment from policymakers is necessary to upgrade the regulatory and infrastructural environment and knowledge base required to integrate AI into HTA-based decision-making processes better.","[Zemplenyi, Antal] Univ Pecs, Fac Pharm, Ctr Hlth Technol Assessment & Pharmacoecon Res, Pecs, Hungary; [Zemplenyi, Antal; Nemeth, Bertalan; Petyko, Zsuzsanna Ida; Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Tachkov, Konstantin; Petrova, Guenka; Savova, Alexandra; Manova, Manoela] Med Univ Sofia, Fac Pharm, Dept Org & Econ Pharm, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Balkanyi, Laszlo] Pannon Univ, Med Informat R&D Ctr, Veszprem, Hungary; [Czech, Marcin] Inst Mother & Child Hlth, Dept Pharmacoecon, Warsaw, Poland; [Dawoud, Dalia] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence NICE, Sci Policy & Res Programme, Sci Evidence & Analyt Directorate, London, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt; [Goettsch, Wim] Univ Utrecht, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Goettsch, Wim; Knies, Saskia] Natl Hlth Care Inst, Diemen, Netherlands; [Ibarluzea, Inaki Gutierrez] Basque Fdn Hlth Innovat & Res, Baracaldo, Spain; [Hren, Rok] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Lorenzovici, Laszlo] Syreon Res Romania, Targu Mures, Romania; [Lorenzovici, Laszlo] GE Palade Univ Med Pharm Sci & Technol, Targu Mures, Romania; [Maravic, Zorana] Digest Canc Europe, Brussels, Belgium; [Piniazhko, Oresta] Minist Hlth Ukraine, HTA Dept State Expert Ctr, Kiev, Ukraine; [Savova, Alexandra; Manova, Manoela] Natl Council Prices & Reimbursement Med Prod, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Tesar, Tomas] Comenius Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Org & Management Pharm, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Zerovnik, Spela] Minist Hlth, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kalo, Zoltan] Semmelweis Univ, Ctr Hlth Technol Assessment, Budapest, Hungary","University of Pecs; Medical University Sofia; University of Pannonia; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Utrecht University; University of Ljubljana; George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures; Ministry of Health of Ukraine; Comenius University Bratislava; Semmelweis University","Zemplényi, A (corresponding author), Univ Pecs, Fac Pharm, Ctr Hlth Technol Assessment & Pharmacoecon Res, Pecs, Hungary.;Zemplényi, A (corresponding author), Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary.",zemplenyi.antal@pte.hu,"Tachkov, Konstantin/ABY-8853-2022; Petrova, Guenka/I-6863-2019; Manova, Manoela/AGN-8886-2022; Balkanyi, Laszlo/HPV-0867-2023; Tesar, Tomas/AAW-4975-2021; Savova, Alexandra/HLQ-0250-2023; Lorenzovici, Laszlo/IUO-7971-2023; Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011; GUTIERREZ-IBARLUZEA, INAKI/AAH-6732-2019","Lorenzovici, Laszlo/0000-0002-1817-2674; Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Goettsch, Wim/0000-0002-8022-7496; GUTIERREZ-IBARLUZEA, INAKI/0000-0002-4080-7963",European Union [82516],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 82516.,,44,13,13,3,17,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

The model involves an integral flow vector that represents carriers together with an integral flow vector that represents the items transported by those carriers. It simultaneously copes with temporal and resource issues, and is difficult to handle in the practice. So we propose here a Project and Lift approach to handle it. We start by projecting the time expanded network model on the original transit network to obtain a simpler two -commodity flow projected model. In order to make this projected model consistent with the original problem, we introduce some complex constraints, prove that these constraints can be separated in polynomial time and discuss the experimental behavior of the related Branch -and -Cut algorithm. Next, we introduce the Lift issue about the way one may turn an optimal solution of our projected model into a solution of the original problem. Finally, we thoroughly study a somewhat restrictive Strong Lift setting of this Lift issue, design and test an exact mixed integer programming Strong Lift model, and discuss some flexible alternative approaches.

For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project Very efficient deep learning in the IoT'' (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.

This hindered their ability to focus on strategic projects and increased the risk of errors due to work overload. Through the implementation of a chatbot, the aim was to provide Beta institution employees with a self-service mechanism that was sufficient to meet most of the demands that previously required the intervention of someone from the benefits team.

In contrast to mainstream centralized artificial intelligence (AI) allowing algorithmic discrimination and manipulative nudging, the decentralized approach of collective learning is by-design participatory and value-sensitive: it aligns with privacy, autonomy, fairness and democratic values. Engineering such values in a socio-technical system results in computational constraints that turn collective decision-making into complex combinatorial NP-hard problems. These are the problems that collective learning and the EPOS research project tackles.

To address some of these challenges and lay the groundwork for transforming workflows research and development, the WorkflowsRI and ExaWorks projects partnered to bring the international workflows community together. This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual Workflows Community Summits (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.","[da Silva, Rafael Ferreira; Mehta, Kshitij; Wolf, Matthew] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [da Silva, Rafael Ferreira; Coleman, Taina; Pottier, Loic] Univ Southern Calif, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA; [Casanova, Henri] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Chard, Kyle; Ozik, Jonathan] Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL USA; [Chard, Kyle; Ozik, Jonathan] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Altintas, Ilkay] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Badia, Rosa M.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Balis, Bartosz; Malawski, Maciej] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland; [Coppens, Frederik] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Coppens, Frederik] VIB Ctr Plant Syst Biol, Ghent, Belgium; [Di Natale, Frank; Laney, Daniel; Peterson, J.

Fortunately, the development and enforcement of specific public health policies, such as vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, among others, has reduced the prevalence and complications associated with COVID-19 in its acute phase. However, the aftermath of the global pandemic has called for an efficient approach to manage patients with long COVID-19. This is a great opportunity to leverage on innovative digital health solutions to provide exhausted health care systems with the most cost-effective and efficient tools available to support the clinical management of this population. In this context, the SENSING-AI project is focused on the research toward the implementation of an artificial intelligence-driven digital health solution that supports both the adaptive self-management of people living with long COVID-19 and the health care staff in charge of the management and follow-up of this population. Objective: The objective of this protocol is the prospective collection of psychometric and biometric data from 10 patients for training algorithms and prediction models to complement the SENSING-AI cohort. Methods: Publicly available health and lifestyle data registries will be consulted and complemented with a retrospective cohort of anonymized data collected from clinical information of patients diagnosed with long COVID-19. Furthermore, a prospective patient-generated data set will be captured using wearable devices and validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaires to complement the retrospective cohort. Finally, the 'Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse' guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship will be applied to the resulting data set to encourage the continuous process of discovery, evaluation, and reuse of information for the research community at large. Results: The SENSING-AI cohort is expected to be completed during 2022. It is expected that sufficient data will be obtained to generate artificial intelligence models based on behavior change and mental well-being techniques to improve patients' self-management, while providing useful and timely clinical decision support services to health care professionals based on risk stratification models and early detection of exacerbations. Conclusions: SENSING-AI focuses on obtaining high-quality data of patients with long COVID-19 during their daily life. Supporting these patients is of paramount importance in the current pandemic situation, including supporting their health care professionals in a cost-effective and efficient management of long COVID-19.

Nowadays, climate change is considered as the principal side effects of using fossil fuels and using conventional transportation systems. Considering the replacement of conventional plants with Renewable Energy (RE), the electrification of energy consumption is one of the key elements of the energy transition, due to the variability of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), and EVs are one of the main ways to increase it. Meanwhile, limited infrastructure for charging and maintenance has made us step forward in battery management, Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMSs), and predictive maintenance for EVs to optimize energy efficiency, to have a range prediction over the distance these smart vehicles will commute. In this study, we had a comprehensive review of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twins (DTs), and Metaverse into the EVs sector to anticipate the energy consumption behavior of electric machines and vital factors that affect their distance navigation.

Specifically, learning platforms and knowledge repositories employing modern AI tools (AILPs) strongly influence human resources management in academic institutions and corporations. AI-based information systems require efficient alignment of business models to the deployment of digital technologies, where platform marketing plays a crucial role. This is why building an appropriate marketing and exploitation strategy is fundamental in achieving the desired economic impacts of AILP operation and exploitation, and for financial decisions concerning further AILP development. This paper presents the methods and final outcomes of collaborative roadmapping as part of an exploitation and marketing strategy and user community building plan for an AILP implemented within a recent Horizon 2020 project. Platform marketing activities have a hierarchical structure. They touch upon the platform as a whole, the platform as a learning tool for its users, as well as may aim at licensing some of its stand-alone software components. The overall strategy has been composed of individual and joint activities. The strategy-building methodology consists of generating alternative action plans, evaluated by multiple criteria. The compromise action plan can be adaptively modified according to user preferences and stakeholder needs. Finally, we will present how the roadmapping diagram was built and assessed to yield a realistic strategy.","[Skulimowski, Andrzej M.

Methods: We identified key weaknesses of traditional health communication and features of more successful eHealth/AI communication. We examined characteristics of the design science paradigm and the value of its user-centered methods to develop eHealth/Al communication. We analyzed a case example of the participatory design of Al components in the ChronologyMD project intended to improve management of Crohn's disease. Results: eHealth/AI communication created with user-centered design shows improved relevance to users' needs for personalized, timely and interactive communication and is associated with better health outcomes than traditional approaches. Participatory design was essential to develop ChronologyMD system architecture and software applications that benefitted patients. Conclusion: Al components can greatly improve eHealth/AI communication, if designed with the intended audiences. Design science theory and its iterative, participatory methods linked with traditional health communication theory and methods can create effective Al health communication. Practice implications: eHealth/AI communication researchers, developers and practitioners can benefit from a holistic approach that draws from theory and methods in both design sciences and also human and social sciences to create successful Al health communication.

Methods: Patients who underwent DR screening in the Metabolic Disease Management Center (MMC) of our hospital were selected as research participants. The degree of coincidence of the AI preliminary report and the ophthalmic diagnosis was compared and analyzed, and the kappa value was calculated. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) was performed in patients referred to the out-of-hospital ophthalmology department, and the consistency between fluorescein angiography and AI diagnosis was evaluated. Results: In total, 6146 patients (12,263 eyes) completed the non-mydriasis fundus examination. The positive DR screening rate was 24.3%. When considering moderate nonproliferative retinopathy as the cut-off point, the kappa coefficient was 0.75 (p < 0.001), the sensitivity was 0.973, and the precision was 0.642, which was shown in the precision-recall curve. Fifty-nine patients referred to receive FFA were compared with non-mydriatic AI diagnoses. The kappa coefficient was 0.53, and the coincidence rate was 66.9%. Conclusion: Non-mydriasis fundus examination combined with AI has a medium-high consistency with ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis, conducive to early DR screening. Combining diagnosis and treatment modes with the Internet can promote the development of telemedicine, alleviate the shortage of ophthalmology resources, and promote the process of blindness prevention and treatment projects.","[Hao, Zhaohu; Xu, Rong; Li, Huanming; Shao, Hailin] Tianjin 4th Cent Hosp, Dept Metab Dis Management Ctr, Tianjin 300140, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiao] Tianjin Med Univ, Chu Hsien I Mem Hosp, NHC Key Lab Hormones & Dev, Tianjin Key Lab Metab Dis, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiao] Tianjin Med Univ, Tianjin Inst Endocrinol, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xinjun] Tianjin Med Univ, Eye Inst, Tianjin Key Lab Retinal Funct & Dis, Eye Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xinjun] Tianjin Med Univ, Sch Optometry, Eye Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin Medical University; Tianjin Medical University; Tianjin Medical University; Tianjin Medical University,"Li, HM; Shao, HL (corresponding author), Tianjin 4th Cent Hosp, Dept Metab Dis Management Ctr, Tianjin 300140, Peoples R China.",lihuanming0716@163.com; Shaohailin1988@sohu.com,"Hao, Zhaohu/GNP-2589-2022","Hao, Zhaohu/0000-0002-3965-3805",Exceptional Young Talents Fostering Foundation 2021 of the Tianjin Fourth Central Hospital [tjdszxyy20210004],Exceptional Young Talents Fostering Foundation 2021 of the Tianjin Fourth Central Hospital,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Exceptional Young Talents Fostering Foundation 2021 of the Tianjin Fourth Central Hospital (tjdszxyy20210004).

A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance wildlife monitoring and management practices.","[Roca, Agustin] Univ San Andres, Lab Inteligencia Artificial & Robot, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Torre, Gabriel] Univ San Andres UBA, LINAR Inst Ingn Biomed, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Giribet, Juan, I; Castro, Gaston; Mas, Ignacio] Univ San Andres, Lab Inteligencia Artificial & Robot, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Colombo, Leonardo] CSIC, Ctr Automat & Robot, Madrid, Spain; [Pereira, Javier] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Caba, Argentina",Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; CSIC-UPM - Centro de Automatica y Robotica; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN),"Roca, A (corresponding author), Univ San Andres, Lab Inteligencia Artificial & Robot, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",aroca@udesa.edu.ar; torreg@udesa.edu.ar; gcastro@udesa.edu.ar; leo.colombo@icmat.es; imas@udesa.edu.ar; jpereira@conicet.gov.ar,,,"ANPCyT, Argentina [PICT-2019-0373, PICT-2019-2371]; Spanish National Research Council","ANPCyT, Argentina(ANPCyT); Spanish National Research Council","We thank the National Parks for all the support received to carry out this research.

Traditional optimization studies are scenario specific, and their solutions do not generalize to new scenarios (e.g., new earth model, new price assumption) that were not seen before. In this paper, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the generalizable field development optimization problem, in which the AI could provide optimized FDPs in seconds for new scenarios within the range of applicability. In the proposed approach, the problem of field development optimization is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) in terms of states, actions, environment, and rewards. The policy function, which is a function that maps the current reservoir state to optimal action at the next step, is represented by a deep convolution neural network (CNN). This policy network is trained using DRL on simulation runs of a large number of different scenarios generated to cover a range of applicability. Once trained, the DRL AI can be applied to obtain optimized FDPs for new scenarios at a minimum computational cost. While the proposed methodology is general, in this paper, we applied it to develop a DRL AI that can provide optimized FDPs for greenfield primary depletion problems with vertical wells. This AI is trained on more than 3x10(6) scenarios with different geological structures, rock and fluid properties, operational constraints, and economic conditions, and thus has a wide range of applicability. After it is trained, the DRL AI yields optimized FDPs for new scenarios within seconds. The solutions from the DRL AI suggest that starting with no reservoir engineering knowledge, the DRL AI has developed the intelligence to place wells at sweet spots, maintain proper well spacing and well count, and drill early. In a blind test, it is demonstrated that the solution from the DRL AI outperforms that from the reference agent, which is an optimized pattern drilling strategy almost 100% of the time. The DRL AI is being applied to a real field and preliminary results are promising. Because the DRL AI optimizes a policy rather than a plan for one particular scenario, it can be applied to obtain optimized development plans for different scenarios at a very low computational cost. This is fundamentally different from traditional optimization methods, which not only require thousands of runs for one scenario but also lack the ability to generalize to new scenarios.","[He, Jincong; Tang, Meng; Hu, Chaoshun; Tanaka, Shusei; Wang, Kainan; Wen, Xian-Huan; Nasir, Yusuf] Chevron Etc, Richmond, CA 94801 USA",Chevron,"He, JC (corresponding author), Chevron Etc, Richmond, CA 94801 USA.",,"Tanaka, Shusei/AAX-2086-2020; Nasir, Yusuf/GRS-7523-2022",,,,,,54,24,26,1,30,SOC PETROLEUM ENG,RICHARDSON,"222 PALISADES CREEK DR,, RICHARDSON, TX 75080 USA",1086-055X,1930-0220,,SPE J,SPE J.,FEB,2022,27,1,,,,,226,245,,10.2118/203951-PA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/203951-PA,,,20,"Engineering, Petroleum",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,ZB9IT,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000757147600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Especially for newcomers to software projects, for management or even for students and pupils, it can be helpful to get a nontechnical insight into the software. We use the concept of visualizing information as comics to present aspects of the software as strikingly as possible, as comics are an effective way to present complex systems and interrelationships for certain target groups. For this purpose, we present a method to generate comics from source code. Our semi-automated process is based on generating a prompt for an LLM from source code, which in turn generates a prompt for a comic image generation using the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. We show that generative AI methods can be used to rapidly generate human-compatible artistic representations from source code.

A promising technology in this context is artificial intelligence (AI). The application of AI can support health care providers in their daily work in various ways. The integrationofAI is particularly promising in clinical decisionsupportsystems(CDSSs). Whiletheopportunitiesofthis technology are numerous, the problems should not be overlooked. Objective: This study aimed to identify challenges and barriers in the context of AI-based CDSSs from the perspectives of experts across various disciplines. Methods: Semistructured expert interviews were conducted with different stakeholders. These included representatives of patients, physicians and caregivers, developers of AI-based CDSSs, researchers (studying AI in health care and social and health law), quality management and quality assurance representatives, a representative of an ethics committee, a representative of a health insurance fund, and medical product consultants. The interviews took place on the web and were recorded, transcribed, and subsequently subjected to a qualitative content analysis based on the method by Kuckartz. The analysis was conducted using MAXQDA software. Initially, the problems were separated into general, development, and clinical use. Finally, a workshop within the project consortium served to systematize the identified problems. Results: A total of 15 expert interviews were conducted, and 309 expert statements with reference to problems and barriers in the context of AI-based CDSSs were identified. These emerged in 7 problem categories: technology (46/309, 14.9%), data (59/309, 19.1%), user (102/309, 33%), studies (17/309, 5.5%), ethics (20/309, 6.5%), law (33/309, 10.7%), and general (32/309, 10.4%). The problem categories were further divided into problem areas, which in turn comprised the respective problems. Conclusions:A large number of problems and barriers were identified in the context of AI-based CDSSs. These can be systematized according to the point at which they occur (general, development, and clinical use) or according to the problem category (technology, data, user, studies, ethics, law, and general). The problems identified in this work should be further investigated. They can be used as a basis for deriving solutions to optimize development, acceptance, and use of AI-based CDSSs.

Moreover, technology trends from standards and research projects (such as Hexa-X) are moving with industry efforts on this evolution. This paper shows the importance of data-driven insights, by first exploring network evolution across the years from a data point of view, and then by using global traffic forecasts complemented by data traffic extractions from a live 5G operator network (statistical network counters and measures from terminals) to draw some considerations on the possible evolution toward 6G.

Moreover, complaint databases are often manually classified, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, previous studies have not provided guidance on how to improve customer complaint data collection and analysis. This research aims to devise an information management model for customer complaints in residential projects. Using Design Science Research, a study was undertaken at a Brazilian residential building company. Multiple sources of evidence were used, including interviews, participant observations, and analysis of an existing database. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to build a word menu for customers to lodge a complaint. Moreover, a recommendation system was proposed based on machine learning (ML) and hierarchical defect classification. The system was designed to indicate which defects should be investigated during inspections. The main outcome of this investigation is an information management model that provides an effective classification system for customer complaints, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) applications that improve data collection, and introduce some degree of automation to warranty services. The main theoretical contribution of the study is the use of advanced data management approaches for managing complaints in residential building projects, resulting in the combination of inputs from technical and customer perspectives to support decision-making.","[Bazzan, Jordana; Echeveste, Marcia Elisa; Formoso, Carlos Torres] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Postgrad Program Civil Engn Construct & Infrastruc, 99 Osvaldo Aranha St, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, Brazil; [Altenbernd, Bernardo; Barbian, Marcia Helena] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Postgrad Program Stat, 9500 Bento Goncalves St, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Bazzan, J (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Postgrad Program Civil Engn Construct & Infrastruc, 99 Osvaldo Aranha St, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, Brazil.",jordanabazzan@gmail.com,"Formoso, Carlos/B-6938-2014","bazzan, jordana/0000-0003-0743-8630",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development through the Academic Doctorate for Innovation Program [142267/2019-8],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development through the Academic Doctorate for Innovation Program,This research was funded by National Council for Scientific and Technological Development through the Academic Doctorate for Innovation Program (No. 142267/2019-8).,,63,5,5,7,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,MAR,2023,13,3,,,,,,,737,10.3390/buildings13030737,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13030737,,,22,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,A3LA6,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000954169100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The potential threats include new uncertainties about unexpected extreme events, widespread predictions of job losses and the dangers of inappropriate unsafe automation. The opportunities include new types of jobs and new understanding of what civil engineers do, how they do it together with large scale improvements in effectiveness. Meeting these challenges requires us first to understand better and re-evaluate the overview of the services we provide. Secondly, we need to get a better handle on how we structure our problems to encompass both the 'big picture' and the detail and to use that structuring to develop workflow modelling tools that handle new sources of uncertain evidence such as AI and the IoT. In this paper I argue that we need to change the conversation about AI to one about AAI or Assistive Artificial Intelligence whilst recognising that the term AI will probably remain in general use. To do that we have to understand and communicate what is special about professional engineering expertise. We need a principle of ingenuity that 'value, nurture and develop practical wisdom' because it contains the crucial necessary qualities of professional engineering that cannot be computerised in the foreseeable future.","[Blockley, David] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Blockley, D (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England.",D.Blockley@bris.ac.uk,,"Blockley, David/0000-0001-7605-8530",,,,,29,11,11,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6608,1029-0249,,CIV ENG ENVIRON SYST,Civ.

This research aimed to evaluate preemergence (PRE) and postemergence (POST) herbicides for providing feasible and economically viable weed management options to farmers for predominant scented rice varieties. Treatments with pendimethalin PRE fb bispyribac-sodium + azimsulfuron POST had lower weed biomass at 45 days after sowing (DAS). At Madhuban, highest grain yield of scented basmati rice (3.43 t ha(-1)) was recorded with the sequential application of pendimethalin PRE fb bispyribac-sodium + azimsulfuron POST. However, at Taraori, yields were similar with pendimethalin or oxadiargyl PRE fb bispyribac-sodium and/or azimsulfuron POST. Applying oxadiargyl by mixing with sand onto flooded field was less effective than spray applications in non-flooded field. The benefit-cost ratio of rice crop was higher with herbicide treatments at both sites as compared with the non-treated weed-free check except single PRE and POST applications and sequential application of oxadiargyl PRE fb oxadiargyl PRE. In a separate experiment conducted at Nagla and Taraori sites, scented rice cultivars' ('CSR 30' and 'Pusa 1121') tolerance to three rates of azimsulfuron (15, 25, and 35 g ai ha(-1)) was evaluated over two years (2010 and 2011). CSR 30 (superfine, scented) was more sensitive to higher rates (35 g ai ha(-1)) of azimsulfuron as compared to Pusa 1121 (fine, scented). Crop injuries were 8 and 28% in case of CSR 30; 5 and 15% in Pusa 1121 when applied with azimsulfuron 25 and 35 g ai ha(-1), respectively. Azimsulfuron applied at 35 g ai ha(-1) reduced yield in both cultivars but in CSR 30 yield reduction was twofold (11.5%) as that of Pusa 1121 (5.2%).

An unstructured interview was used to gather empirical evidence during a focus group meeting. Analyzing the selected primary performance metrics, it was projected that the farm's profitability would increase by 19 percent, productivity would increase by 21 percent, and the farm's environmental impact would decrease by 22 percent. Automation and remote work would help minimize the farm's worker burden while also making control panels, decision-making files, and data analysis more available. In order for the domain to be as prosperous as possible, farmers must be made aware of the benefits of using these emerging technologies for closing the gap between farmers and Information Technology (IT) solution providers, and this can be accomplished through continuous training for both farmers and their technology vendors.","[Micle, Diana Elena; Deiac, Florina; Olar, Alexandru; Arion, Felix Hpratiu] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Cluj Napoca, Dept Econ Sci, 3-5 Manastur St, Cluj Napoca 400372, Romania; [Drenta, Raul Florentin] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, North Univ Ctr Baia Mare, Fac Engn, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania; [Florean, Cristian] Centr IT, Sannicoara 407042, Romania; [Coman, Ionut Grigore] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Machine Bldg, Dept Ind Engn, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania; [Arion, Felix Hpratiu] Asociatia Clusterul Agrofood Ind Napoca AgroTrans, Dezmir 407039, Romania",University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca; Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Deiac, F (corresponding author), Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Cluj Napoca, Dept Econ Sci, 3-5 Manastur St, Cluj Napoca 400372, Romania.",micle@usamvcluj.ro; florina.deiac@usamvcluj.ro; alexandru.olar@usamvcluj.ro; drenta.raul@gmail.com; cristian.florean@centricit.ro; ionutcoman.proiecte@gmail.com; felixarion@usamvcluj.ro,"Drenta, Raul/AAN-7201-2020; Arion, Felix/AAB-4183-2022; Olar, Alexandru/B-3413-2019","Arion, Felix/0000-0003-1546-5903; Raul, Drenta/0000-0002-8410-7918; Olar, Alexandru/0000-0001-5313-6604","AgroTransilvania Cluster, through the project TRACK Project [COS-CLUSTPARTN-2017-3-02]; European Union's COSME Programme; European Regional Development Fund [POC-A1-A1.1.1-B-2015, P_35_476]","AgroTransilvania Cluster, through the project TRACK Project; European Union's COSME Programme; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU))","A.F.H. acknowledge the support by AgroTransilvania Cluster, through the project TRACK Project (COS-CLUSTPARTN-2017-3-02: Tracking opportunities to develop and strengthen data collection and big data in agri-chain to increase competitivity of SMEs-TRACK.

Funded under the European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of 'emotional AI' and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations.

Due to climate change and human activities, there were dramatic changes in the alpine domain of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a vital project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The CPEC is subjected to rapid infrastructure expansion, which may lead to potential land surface susceptibility. Hence, focusing on sustainable development goals, mainly SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) and SDG 13 (climate action), to evaluate the conservation and management practices for the sustainable and regenerative development of the mountainous region, this study aims to assess change detection and find climatic conditions using multispectral indices along the mountainous area of Gilgit and Hunza-Nagar, Pakistan. It has yielded practical and highly relevant implications. For sustainable and regenerative ecologies, this study utilized 30 x 30 m Landsat 5 (TM), Landsat 7 (ETM+), and Landsat-8/9 (OLI and TIRS), and meteorological data were employed to calculate the aridity index (AI). The results of the AI showed a non-significant decreasing trend (-0.0021/year, p > 0.05) in Gilgit and a significant decreasing trend (-0.0262/year, p < 0.05) in Hunza-Nagar.

Similarly, NDBI demonstrated an increasing trend, with rates of 79.89%, 87.69%, and 83.85% from 2008 to 2023. The decreasing values of AI mean a drying trend and increasing drought risk, as the study area already has an arid and semi-arid climate. The combination of multispectral indices and the AI provides a comprehensive insight into how various factors affect the mountainous landscape and climatic conditions in the study area. This study has practical and highly relevant implications for policymakers and researchers interested in research related to land use and land cover change, environmental and infrastructure development in alpine regions.","[Khan, Amjad Ali; Xue, Xian] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecol Safety & Sustainable Dev Arid Lands, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Khan, Amjad Ali; Xue, Xian] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Dry Lands Salinizat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Khan, Amjad Ali; Xue, Xian; Muhammad, Ali; Mukhtar, Muhammad Ahsan; Butt, Asim Qayyum] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Hassam] Karakorum Int Univ Gilgit, Dept Environm Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Hussain, Kiramat] Forest Wildlife & Environm Dept Govt Gilgit Baltis, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Ali; Mukhtar, Muhammad Ahsan; Butt, Asim Qayyum] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Cryospher Sci & Frozen Soil Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Xue, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecol Safety & Sustainable Dev Arid Lands, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Xue, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Dry Lands Salinizat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Xue, X (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",amjadalikhan@nieer.ac.cn; xianxue@lzb.ac.cn; hassamhussain844@gmail.com; kiramatpu@yahoo.com; alimuhammad@nieer.ac.cn; amscewre@gmail.com; asimbutt7891@mails.ucas.ac.cn,,"khan, Amjad Ali/0000-0001-6405-9907; BUTT, ASIM QAYYUM/0009-0000-0552-2703; Xue, Xian/0000-0003-1795-8656",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF0801902],National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFF0801902) financially supported this research.,,110,1,1,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2024,16,23,,,,,,,10311,10.3390/su162310311,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162310311,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,P6E2R,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001378810900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coping up with surging energy demands requires several reforms in both renewable and non-renewable sectors. Factors such as rising population, reduction in the cost of renewable energy technology and their effect on the nation's GDP, can make policy making a herculean task and the justification for such policies, quite opaque to the public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can help decision makers to quickly draw conclusions from voluminous datasets under different heads. However, AI results need to be post-processed so that they are easily understood by the layperson. This paper focuses on using Sankey diagrams as a post-processing tool for AI systems. Policy formulation often requires an overall assessment of energy sources, production pathways, end used destinations and wastage encountered-these can be easily visualized with a Sankey diagram. For this work, a Sankey protocol was written out in a form where a prompt asks the user to supply information through a spreadsheet interfaced with a customized mobile app-a first anywhere in the subcontinent. India's mobile sector is vibrant, and the paper presents a enabling the user to have a handle on the dynamics of energy distribution locally. The app gives an instant feel of the apportioned energy across grids, the projected changes for the next decade, the efficiency and feasibility of each sector and lastly a telling visual representation showing the main strengths and weaknesses in the energy sector.","[Chandra, Anant; Ghosh, Satyajit] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ghosh, Satyajit] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT); VIT Vellore; University of Leeds,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.;Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",satyajitg@vit.ac.in,,"Chandra, Anant/0000-0002-3633-7364",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0951-5666,1435-5655,,AI SOC,AI Soc.,JUN,2020,35,2,,,,,401,407,,10.1007/s00146-019-00900-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-019-00900-3,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,LW6GO,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000539242900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim was to help students generate computer code to solve, automate, and streamline practical challenges in advanced construction engineering and management (CEM). To this end, a host of problem-based learning (PBL) individual assignments and collaborative team projects were developed, alongside a combination of flipped classroom models and blended learning lessons, in order to teach effective interactions with LLMs and mitigate concerns, such as bias and hallucination. The effective interaction with LLMs not only facilitated code generation, which would otherwise be complex without additional formal training, but also provided a platform for strengthening basic project management skills, such as departmentalization, work breakdown structuring, modularization, activity delegation, and defining key performance indicators. The effectiveness of this approach was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated within two new modules, Digital Engineering and Construction and Digital Technologies in Field Information Modeling. These modules were offered over three semesters each as part of a new M.Sc. program in Technology and Management in Construction at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. It was observed that 86.4% of students fully completed the PBL projects, while the remaining 13.6% achieved over 50% completion across all six semesters. Furthermore, anonymous student surveys indicated a teaching quality index of 100% in five semesters and 96.4% in one semester. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed strategy can be used to effectively integrate LLMs to support students in code generation for open-ended projects in CEM. Further research was, however, found to be necessary to ensure the sustainable revision and redesign of the problems as LLM capabilities evolve.","[Maalek, Reza] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol & Management Construct TMB, Dept Digital Engn & Construct DEC, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Maalek, R (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol & Management Construct TMB, Dept Digital Engn & Construct DEC, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",reza.maalek@kit.edu,"Maalek, Reza/AAF-8299-2021","Maalek, Reza/0000-0001-6825-2691",KIT Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,KIT Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,The author wishes to acknowledge the support provided by the KIT Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in supplying the APC.

However, the effectiveness and fairness of AI are critically dependent on the data it learns from. Biased datasets can lead to AI outputs that perpetuate disparities, particularly affecting social minorities and marginalized groups.ObjectiveThis paper introduces the Data Artifacts Glossary, a dynamic, open-source framework designed to systematically document and update potential biases in healthcare datasets. The aim is to provide a comprehensive tool that enhances the transparency and accuracy of AI applications in healthcare and contributes to understanding and addressing health inequities.MethodsUtilizing a methodology inspired by the Delphi method, a diverse team of experts conducted iterative rounds of discussions and literature reviews. The team synthesized insights to develop a comprehensive list of bias categories and designed the glossary's structure. The Data Artifacts Glossary was piloted using the MIMIC-IV dataset to validate its utility and structure.ResultsThe Data Artifacts Glossary adopts a collaborative approach modeled on successful open-source projects like Linux and Python. Hosted on GitHub, it utilizes robust version control and collaborative features, allowing stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to contribute. Through a rigorous peer review process managed by community members, the glossary ensures the continual refinement and accuracy of its contents. The implementation of the Data Artifacts Glossary with the MIMIC-IV dataset illustrates its utility. It categorizes biases, and facilitates their identification and understanding.ConclusionThe Data Artifacts Glossary serves as a vital resource for enhancing the integrity of AI applications in healthcare by providing a mechanism to recognize and mitigate dataset biases before they impact AI outputs. It not only aids in avoiding bias in model development but also contributes to understanding and addressing the root causes of health disparities.","[Gameiro, Rodrigo R.; Woite, Naira Link; Sauer, Christopher M.; Fernandes, Chrystinne Oliveira; Celi, Leo Anthony] MIT, Lab Computat Physiol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gameiro, Rodrigo R.; Woite, Naira Link; Fernandes, Chrystinne Oliveira; Celi, Leo Anthony] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sauer, Christopher M.] Univ Hosp Essen, Inst Artificial Intelligence Med, Lab Clin Res & Real World Evidence, Essen, Germany; [Sauer, Christopher M.] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Hematol & Stem Cell Transplantat, Essen, Germany; [Hao, Sicheng; Wong, An-Kwok Ian] Duke Univ, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, Durham, NC USA; [Premo, Anna E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Learning Res & Dev Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Premo, Anna E.] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA USA; [Teixeira, Alice Rangel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Philosophy, Barcelona, Spain; [Resli, Isabelle] Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR USA; [Celi, Leo Anthony] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

What is the implication of the main finding? Policymakers can utilize these AI-driven tools to make more informed, data-supported decisions, improving urban mobility and sustainability The methodology can be adapted to other cities, demonstrating the scalability and flexibility of the Urbanite platform in various urban settings.Abstract To address the growing need for advanced tools that enable urban policymakers to conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of traffic management changes, the Urbanite H2020 project has developed innovative artificial intelligence methods. Among them is a robust decision support system that assists policymakers in evaluating and selecting optimal urban mobility planning modifications by combining objective and subjective criteria. Utilising open-source microscopic traffic simulation tools, accurate digital models (or digital twins) of four pilot cities-Bilbao, Amsterdam, Helsinki, and Messina-were created, each addressing unique mobility challenges. These challenges include reducing private vehicle access in Bilbao's city center, analysing the impact of increased bicycle traffic and population growth in Amsterdam, constructing a mobility-enhancing tunnel in Helsinki, and improving public transport connectivity in Messina. The research introduces five key innovations: the application of a consistent open-source simulation platform across diverse urban environments, addressing integration and consistency challenges; the pioneering use of Dexi for advanced decision support in smart cities; the implementation of advanced visualisations; and the integration of the machine learning tool, Orange, with a user-friendly GUI interface. These innovations collectively make complex data analysis accessible to non-technical users. By applying multi-label machine learning techniques, the decision-making process is accelerated by three orders of magnitude, significantly enhancing urban planning efficiency. The Urbanite project's findings offer valuable insights into both anticipated and unexpected outcomes of mobility interventions, presenting a scalable, open-source AI-based framework for urban decision-makers worldwide.","[Shulajkovska, Miljana; Smerkol, Maj; Noveski, Gjorgji; Gams, Matjaz] Jozef Stefan Inst, Dept Intelligent Syst, Jamova cesta 39, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Jozef Stefan Institute,"Shulajkovska, M (corresponding author), Jozef Stefan Inst, Dept Intelligent Syst, Jamova cesta 39, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",miljana.sulajkovska@ijs.si; maj.smerkol@ijs.si; g.noveski@yahoo.com; matjaz.gams@ijs.si,"Noveski, Gjorgji/LCD-3229-2024","Gams, Matjaz/0000-0002-5747-0711; Shulajkovska, Miljana/0009-0009-8833-9802",The European Union's Horizon 2020 [870338]; European Union [P2-0209]; Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency,The European Union's Horizon 2020; European Union(European Union (EU)); Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency,This work is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 870338.

Current examples are PV systems floating on water, and also dual-use land where agriculture is interwoven with PV panels. There are clearly challenges with these types of implementations in that either the geography makes the installation more difficult, or the activity requires a need to share both the land and the light harvesting of photons. Because of these challenges, it is necessary to optimize the implementation of the PV and other land-use to extract meaningful value beyond just a demonstration project. But the diversity and complexity of the configurations do not lend themselves to simple analysis. Given this complexity, it is necessary to develop flexible algorithms which can take multiple variables into account where the data may be from multiple complex sources. This is the very configuration where Advanced Neural Net applications can assist and guide the installation and management of the combined land-use activities. This paper will describe the following: (1) the key advantages of AI/ML, along with the current issues, (2) the need for transferrable algorithms development, and (3) the overall methodology for implementation and extension to the broader PV dual-land use segment. Specific data will be presented on the novel AI/ML proposed. A key attribute with this novel AI/ML is one can scale and transfer the template developed without recustomization. The key point of the paper is that - as with any niche application of PV and especially in a dual-use mode, there are substantial challenges which must be overcome, and the use of AI/ML will be a useful tool to exploit the advantages and elevate the application to a more broadly used mode of PV.","[Skumanich, Andy] Innov8ai Inc, San Jose, CA 95126 USA; Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Skumanich, A (corresponding author), Innov8ai Inc, San Jose, CA 95126 USA.",,,"Skumanich, Andy/0009-0006-0821-2149",,,,,10,2,2,0,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0160-8371,,978-1-6654-1922-2,IEEE PHOT SPEC CONF,,,2021,,,,,,,459,463,,10.1109/PVSC43889.2021.9518677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PVSC43889.2021.9518677,,,5,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Physics,BS2IE,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000701690400106,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kureljusic, M; Karger, E",,,,"Kureljusic, Marko; Karger, Erik",,,Forecasting in financial accounting with artificial intelligence - A systematic literature review and future research agenda,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH,,,English,Review,,,,,,Accounting; Forecasting; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Deep learning,DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH; NEURAL-NETWORK; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; MODEL; INTEGRATION; TECHNOLOGY; PROFESSION; CHALLENGES; EARNINGS; FAILURE,"Purpose - Accounting information systems are mainly rule-based, and data are usually available and well-structured. However, many accounting systems are yet to catch up with current technological developments. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) in financial accounting is often applied only in pilot projects. Using AI-based forecasts in accounting enables proactive management and detailed analysis. However, thus far, there is little knowledge about which prediction models have already been evaluated for accounting problems. Given this lack of research, our study aims to summarize existing findings on how AI is used for forecasting purposes in financial accounting. Therefore, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview and agenda for future researchers to gain more generalizable knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - The authors identify existing research on AI-based forecasting in financial accounting by conducting a systematic literature review. For this purpose, the authors used Scopus and Web of Science as scientific databases. The data collection resulted in a final sample size of 47 studies. These studies were analyzed regarding their forecasting purpose, sample size, period and applied machine learning algorithms. Findings - The authors identified three application areas and presented details regarding the accuracy and AI methods used. Our findings show that sociotechnical and generalizable knowledge is still missing. Therefore, the authors also develop an open research agenda that future researchers can address to enable the more frequent and efficient use of AI-based forecasts in financial accounting. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the rapid development of AI algorithms, our results can only provide an overview of the current state of research. Therefore, it is likely that new AI algorithms will be applied, which have not yet been covered in existing research. However, interested researchers can use our findings and future research agenda to develop this field further. Practical implications - Given the high relevance of AI in financial accounting, our results have several implications and potential benefits for practitioners. First, the authors provide an overview of AI algorithms used in different accounting use cases. Based on this overview, companies can evaluate the AI algorithms that are most suitable for their practical needs. Second, practitioners can use our results as a benchmark of what prediction accuracy is achievable and should strive for. Finally, our study identified several blind spots in the research, such as ensuring employee acceptance of machine learning algorithms in companies. However, companies should consider this to implement AI in financial accounting successfully. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted that provided a comprehensive overview of AI-based forecasting in financial accounting. Given the high potential of AI in accounting, the authors aimed to bridge this research gap. Moreover, our cross-application view provides general insights into the superiority of specific algorithms.","[Kureljusic, Marko] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Int Accounting, Campus Essen, Essen, Germany; [Karger, Erik] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Informat Syst & Strateg IT Management, Campus Essen, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen,"Kureljusic, M (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Int Accounting, Campus Essen, Essen, Germany.",marko.kureljusic@uni-due.de; erik.karger@uni-due.de,,"Kureljusic, Marko/0000-0003-4382-0669",Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen,Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen,The authors acknowledge the support by the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen.,,136,8,8,29,90,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-5426,1758-8855,,J APPL ACCOUNT RES,J.

In 2019, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List and developed into a tourist park for public visitation. It provides new evidence for understanding water management in the Neolithic Taihu Lake Basin of China. Water management was the primary consideration during the planning of Liangzhu Ancient City, a stark contrast to urban construction practices post the Xia Dynasty. Resolving the conflict between land and water formed the foundation for the sustainable development of Liangzhu civilization, evident in the management of rivers and marshes during the construction of city walls, settlements, moats, and farmland.

Results: Since the beginning of the 2000's, several telemedicine projects and trials focused on chronic heart failure have been developed. The first telemedicine projects (e.g., TEN-HMS, BEAT-HF, Tele-HF, and TIM-HF) primarily investigated telemonitoring or for the older ones, telephone follow-up. Numerous second-generation telemedicine projects have emerged in Europe over the last ten years or are still under development for computer science heart failure, especially in Europe, such as SCAD, OSICAT, E-care, PRADO-INCADO, and TIM-HF2. The E-care telemonitoring project fits within the telemedicine 2.0 framework, based on connected objects, new information and communication technologies (ICT) and Web 2.0 technologies. E-care is the first telemedicine project including artificial intelligence (AI). TIM-HF2 is the first positive prospective randomized study with regards to EBM with positive significant clinical benefit, in terms of unplanned cardiovascular hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. The potential contribution of second-generation telemedicine projects in terms of mortality, morbidity, and number of hospitalizations avoided is currently under study. Their impact in terms of health economics is likewise being investigated, taking into account that the economic and social benefits brought up by telemedicine solutions were previously validated by the original telemedicine projects.","[Andres, Emmanuel] Hop Univ Strasbourg, Serv Med Interne Diabet & Malad Metab Clin Med B, 1 Porte Hop, F-67091 Strasbourg, France; [Andres, Emmanuel; Talha, Samy; Geny, Bernard] Univ Strasbourg Unistra, Fac Med Strasbourg, Equipe Rech EA Mitochondrie Stress Oxydant & Prot, 4 Rue Kirschleger, F-67091 Strasbourg, France; [Talha, Samy; Geny, Bernard] Hop Univ Strasbourg, Serv Physiol & Explorat Fonct, 1 Porte Hop, F-67091 Strasbourg, France; [Zulfiqar, Abrar-Ahmad] CHU Rouen, Serv Med Interne Geriatrie & Therapeut, F-76000 Rouen, France; [Hajjam, Mohamed] Predimed Technol, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Erve, Sylvie; Hajjam, Jawad] Ctr Expertise Technol Informat & Commun Auton CEN, F-49000 Angers, France; [Erve, Sylvie; Hajjam, Jawad] MFAM, F-49000 Angers, France; [El Hassani, Amir Hajjam] UTBM, Equipe Rech Nanomed Imagerie Therapeut 4662, F-25200 Belfort Montbeliard, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; CHU Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; CHU Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Rouen Normandie; CHU de Rouen; Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM),"Andrès, E (corresponding author), Hop Univ Strasbourg, Serv Med Interne Diabet & Malad Metab Clin Med B, 1 Porte Hop, F-67091 Strasbourg, France.;Andrès, E (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg Unistra, Fac Med Strasbourg, Equipe Rech EA Mitochondrie Stress Oxydant & Prot, 4 Rue Kirschleger, F-67091 Strasbourg, France.",emmanuel.andres@chru-strasbourg.fr; samy.talha@chru-strasbourg.fr; abzulfiqar@gmail.com; mha@newel.net; sylvie.erve@centich.fr; jawad.hajjam@centich.fr; bernard.geny@chru-strasbourg.fr; amir.hajjam-el-hassani@utbm.fr,"Andres, E/AAY-3767-2020; Hajjam, Amir/ABF-0303-2022","Andres, Emmanuel/0000-0002-7914-7616; HAJJAM EL HASSANI, Amir/0000-0002-8470-806X",Fondation de l'Avenir; Agence Regionale de Sante du Grand-Est (ARS); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Fondation de l'Avenir; Agence Regionale de Sante du Grand-Est (ARS); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Grants from the Fondation de l'Avenir, the Agence Regionale de Sante du Grand-Est (ARS) and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR).",,34,47,49,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

BIM technology has enabled a wide range of functional applications, one of which, '4D BIM', involves linking the tasks in a project's construction schedule to its object-orientated 3D model to improve the logistical decision making and delivery of the project. Ideally, this can be automatically generated but in reality, this is not currently possible, and the process requires considerable manual effort. The level of maturity and expertise in the use of BIM amongst the project participants still varies considerably; adding further obstacles to the ability to derive full benefits from BIM. Reflecting these challenges, two case studies are presented in this paper. The first describes a predominantly manual approach that was used to ameliorate the implementation of 4D BIM on a project in Paris. In fact, there is scope for automating the process: a combination of BIM and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could exploit newly-available data that are increasingly obtainable from smart devices or IoT sensors. A prerequisite for doing so is the development of dedicated ontologies that enable the formalisation of the domain knowledge that is relevant to a particular project typology. Perhaps the most challenging example of this is the case of renovation projects. In the second case study, part of a large European research project, the authors propose such an ontology and demonstrate its application by developing a digital tool for application within the context of deep renovation projects.","[Doukari, Omar; Greenwood, David] Northumbria Univ, Digital Built Environm Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7YT, Tyne & Wear, England; [Seck, Boubacar] CESI Ecole Ingenieurs, Ctr Paris Nanterre, F-92000 Nanterre, France",Northumbria University,"Doukari, O (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Digital Built Environm Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7YT, Tyne & Wear, England.",omar.doukari@northumbria.ac.uk; bseck@cesi.fr; david.greenwood@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Doukari, Omar/0000-0003-4535-2264; SECK, El Hadji Boubacar/0000-0003-3604-6767",European Union [892071],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the RINNO project (https://RINNO-h2020.eu/accessed on 1 August 2022 [103,104]) under Grant Agreement Number 892071.",,117,24,25,13,82,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,AUG,2022,12,8,,,,,,,1145,10.3390/buildings12081145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12081145,,,33,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,4A4XI,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000845105800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist fracture detection in adult patients exist, although their efficacy in children is less well known. This study aims to evaluate whether a commercially available AI tool (certified for paediatric use) improves healthcare professionals (HCPs) detection of fractures, and how this may impact patient care in a retrospective simulated study design. Methods and analysis Using a multicentric dataset of 500 paediatric radiographs across four body parts, the diagnostic performance of HCPs will be evaluated across two stages-first without, followed by with the assistance of an AI tool (BoneView, Gleamer) after an interval 4-week washout period. The dataset will contain a mixture of normal and abnormal cases. HCPs will be recruited across radiology, orthopaedics and emergency medicine. We will aim for 40 readers, with similar to 14 in each subspecialty, half being experienced consultants. For each radiograph HCPs will evaluate presence of a fracture, their confidence level and a suitable simulated management plan. Diagnostic accuracy will be judged against a consensus interpretation by an expert panel of two paediatric radiologists (ground truth). Multilevel logistic modelling techniques will analyse and report diagnostic accuracy outcome measures for fracture detection. Descriptive statistics will evaluate changes in simulated patient management.

One of these crucial elements is the implementation of organizational changes. There has been a wide-spread adoption of AI techniques in the private sector, whereas in the public sector their use has been recently extended. One of the greatest challenges that European governments have to face is the implementation of a wide variety of European Union (EU) funding programs which have evolved in the context of the EU long-term budget. In the current study, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are intertwined with forecasting the outcomes of a co-financed EU program by means of its impact on the non-financial measures of the government body that materialized it. The predictive accuracy of the present model advanced in this research study takes into account all the complexities of the business environment, within which the provided dataset is produced. The outcomes of the study showed that the measures taken to enhance customer satisfaction allows for further improvement.

SURGE-Ahead is a collaborative project that aims to develop a clinical decision support system that uses predictive models to support geriatric co-management in surgical wards. Delirium is a common complication in older adults after surgery, leading to poor outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Early and accurate prediction of POD is crucial for timely intervention and prevention strategies.MethodsThe SURGE-Ahead algorithm utilizes a linear support vector machine model with a comprehensive set of 15 clinical and demographic features. In our validation, we analyzed 173 study participants, of which 50 developed POD.ResultsThe study found that the SURGE-Ahead POD prediction algorithm yielded state-of-the-art performance, using only preoperative data, with a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.86. In addition, the SURGE-Ahead algorithm exhibited good calibration as shown by a Brier Score of 0.14. The algorithm is openly available on GitHub, facilitating its implementation and adaptation to different surgical settings.ConclusionOur findings contribute to the development of reliable POD prediction tools, ultimately supporting the improvement of patient care in hospitalized older adults.","[Kocar, Thomas Derya; Leinert, Christoph; Brefka, Simone; Denkinger, Michael] Ulm Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Geriatr Res, AGAPLES Bethesda Ulm, Zollernring 26, D-89073 Ulm, Germany; [Kocar, Thomas Derya; Leinert, Christoph; Brefka, Simone; Dallmeier, Dhayana; Denkinger, Michael] Geriatr Ctr Ulm, Ulm, Germany; [Wolf, Philip; Kestler, Hans] Ulm Univ, Inst Med Syst Biol, Ulm, Germany; [Fotteler, Marina L.] Neu Ulm Univ Appl Sci, DigiHealth Inst, Neu Ulm, Germany; [Uihlein, Adriane; Gebhard, Florian] Ulm Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped Trauma Hand Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Ulm, Germany; [Wezel, Felix] Univ Hosp Ulm, Dept Urol & Pediat Urol, Ulm, Germany; [Wehling, Martin] Heidelberg Univ, Clin Pharmacol, Mannheim, Germany; [Rahbari, Nuh] Ulm Univ Hosp, Dept Surg, Ulm, Germany; [Dallmeier, Dhayana] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA",Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ulm University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ulm University; Boston University,"Kocar, TD (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Geriatr Res, AGAPLES Bethesda Ulm, Zollernring 26, D-89073 Ulm, Germany.;Kocar, TD (corresponding author), Geriatr Ctr Ulm, Ulm, Germany.",thomas.kocar@uni-ulm.de,,,Projekt DEAL; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GY2101],Projekt DEAL; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The PRIMAGE project is a European multi-center research initiative that focuses on developing medical imaging-derived artificial intelligence (AI) solutions designed to enhance overall management and decision-making for two types of pediatric cancer: neuroblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. To allow this, the PRIMAGE project has created an open-cloud platform that combines imaging, clinical, and molecular data together with AI models developed from this data, creating a comprehensive decision support environment for clinicians managing patients with these two cancers. In order to achieve this, a standardized data processing and analysis workflow was implemented to generate robust and reliable predictions for different clinical endpoints. Magnetic resonance (MR) image harmonization and registration was performed as part of the workflow. Subsequently, an automated tool for the detection and segmentation of tumors was trained and internally validated. The Dice similarity coefficient obtained for the independent validation dataset was 0.997, indicating compatibility with the manual segmentation variability. Following this, radiomics and deep features were extracted and correlated with clinical endpoints. Finally, reproducible and relevant imaging quantitative features were integrated with clinical and molecular data to enrich both the predictive models and a set of visual analytics tools, making the PRIMAGE platform a complete clinical decision aid system. In order to ensure the advancement of research in this field and to foster engagement with the wider research community, the PRIMAGE data repository and platform are currently being integrated into the European Federation for Cancer Images (EUCAIM), which is the largest European cancer imaging research infrastructure created to date.","[Veiga-Canuto, Diana; Cerda Alberich, Leonor; Fernandez-Paton, Matias; Miguel Blanco, Ana; Marti-Bonmati, Luis] Inst Invest Sanitaria La Fe, Gp Invest Biomed Imagen, Ave Fernando Abril Martorell,106 Torre A Planta 7, Valencia 46026, Spain; [Veiga-Canuto, Diana; Sanguesa Nebot, Cinta; Marti-Bonmati, Luis] Hosp Univ & Politecn La Fe, Area Clin Imagen Med, Ave Fernando Abril Martorell,106 Torre E Planta 0, Valencia 46026, Spain; [Jimenez Pastor, Ana; Lozano-Montoya, Jose] QUIBIM SL, Quantitat Imaging Biomarkers Med, Valencia, Spain; [Martinez de las Heras, Blanca] Hosp Univ & Politecn La Fe, Dept Pediat Oncol, Ave Fernando Abril Martorell,106 Torre G Planta 2, Valencia 46026, Spain",Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe; Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe,"Veiga-Canuto, D (corresponding author), Inst Invest Sanitaria La Fe, Gp Invest Biomed Imagen, Ave Fernando Abril Martorell,106 Torre A Planta 7, Valencia 46026, Spain.;Veiga-Canuto, D (corresponding author), Hosp Univ & Politecn La Fe, Area Clin Imagen Med, Ave Fernando Abril Martorell,106 Torre E Planta 0, Valencia 46026, Spain.",dianaveigac@gmail.com,"; Marti-Bonmati, Luis/A-1147-2015","Veiga-Canuto, Diana/0000-0002-6048-2940; Fernandez Paton, Matias/0000-0001-9374-1411; Cerda Alberich, Leonor/0000-0002-5567-4278; Marti-Bonmati, Luis/0000-0002-8234-010X",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(Horizon 2020),"PRIMAGE project consortium collaborators: Ulrike Potschger, PhD, Sabine Taschner-Mandl, PhD, Emanuele Neri, MD, Adela Canete, MD, PhD, Ruth Ladenstein, MD, PhD, Barbara Hero, MD, & Aacute;ngel Alberich Bayarri, PhD.",,36,3,3,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0301-0449,1432-1998,,PEDIATR RADIOL,Pediatr.

Method: We joint a project, developed to explore and develop collaborative working between nurses and doctors in paediatric oncology under the auspices of The European Cancer Organization (ECCO), The International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and The European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS). The Appreciative Inquiry (AI) approach to change management was chosen as it looks at what works in an organization and builds on that to make improvements. Results: Using AI we chose to develop a programme of education for nursing staff, as a project of local interest, to enhance their skills and knowledge of the specialty with the main aim of providing high quality care and ensuring best practice. We found that collaboration profoundly influenced the working environment and resulted in staff being receptive to new challenges. With improved knowledge, nurses are actually more involved in best practice which, in turn, motivates the doctors and improves professional relationships and the patient's treatment and care. Conclusions: We have stressed the importance of collaborative working throughout and used this model of nurse/doctor collaboration to improve the quality of care in our center. We are very hopeful that this model of collaboration and education will last longer than the project itself and be followed by future generations of doctors and nurses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The programme EIP-Agri Sweden (European Innovation Project, Agri in Sweden) has approved a project to develop such an innovation based on new technology. The innovation is a first stage of a decision support solution ( or system) to be able to achieve a sustainable and competitive production of fruit and wine. The innovation will be based on tools like sensors, information and communication technology (ICT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to, for example, increase and optimize harvest yield, reduce environmental and climate impact, and decrease labour costs. The results will be included in a platform that can be adaptive in the future to other crops like for example raspberries and strawberries. A digital assistant for field production is planned in the first stage to be developed. A fine meshed network of connected sensors collects climate and other data and sends them over an IoT network to a cloud system. A machine learning system (ML) uses these data together with manual observations of the crop phenological stages during the season, as well as measurements taken by the producers. Examples of manual observations are plant diseases, nutrient deficiency. The machine learning system will work as a Digital Assistant for the producer. Gives, for example, diseases prognosis, nutrient demands, irrigation and optimal dates for harvest, as well as yield quality at harvest. The work in the project is carried out by a cross functional team consisting of producers, experts in food, agriculture and horticulture, measurement-, digitalisation of Food systems, software/system-, marketing-, and AI/ML-experts.

This is largely attributed to the public perception that waste segregation is a foreign idea, coupled with a lack of public knowledge. Around 72.19% of the residents are unsure about waste categorization and proper waste disposal. This confusion leads to apathy toward recycling efforts exacerbated by deficient environmental awareness. Existing waste classification systems mainly rely on manual entry of waste item names, leading to inaccuracies and lack of user engagement, prompting a shift towards advanced deep learning models. Moreover, current systems often fail to provide comprehensive disposal guidelines, leaving users uninformed. This project addresses the gap by specifically developing an AI- Powered Waste Classification System incorporated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), classifying waste technologically and providing environmentally friendly disposal guidelines. By leveraging primary and secondary waste image data, the project achieves a training accuracy of 80.66% and a validation accuracy of 77.62% in waste classification. The uniqueness of this project lies in its utilization of CNN within a user-friendly web interface that allows the user to capture or upload waste image, offering immediate waste classification results and sustainable waste disposal guidelines. It also enables users to locate recycling centers and access the dashboard. This system represents an ongoing effort to educate people and contribute to the field of waste management. It promotes Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), contributes zero waste, raises environmental awareness, and aligns with Malaysia's goals to increase recycling rates to 40% and reduce waste sent to landfills by 2025.","[Yi, Chan Jia; Kim, Chong Fong] INTI Int Univ, Fac Data Sci & Informat Technol, Nilai, Malaysia",INTI International University,"Yi, CJ (corresponding author), INTI Int Univ, Fac Data Sci & Informat Technol, Nilai, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,3,3,SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD,WEST YORKSHIRE,"19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",2158-107X,2156-5570,,INT J ADV COMPUT SC,Int.

To orchestrate and optimize mobile access networks with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, the O-RAN community standardized the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Owing to RICs, the mobile network operator can obtain more optimization solutions for classical use cases (e.g., ondemand traffic steering, anomaly detection, Quality-of-Service (QoS) management, and base station on-off policy). To intelligently control the network, RICs need to collect the data to make and verify the intelligent application. Thus, the O-RAN simulator is necessary for obtaining RAN data collection and testing intelligent applications in RICs. In this work, we develop a network simulation-3 (ns-3)-based novel O-RAN simulator by benchmarking the ns-O-RAN project. A real-world nearreal-time RIC and ns3-simulated 5G NR gNBs are integrated through the E2 interface by exchanging E2 messages, RAN key performance measurements (KPMs), and RIC Control Messages.

This review aims at how emerging technologies like IoT, AI, cloud technology, and BIM are making changes to fire safety in structural structures. With IoT-enabled sensors, data, and analytics coupled with predictive algorithms for real-time scenarios, fire safety systems have become dynamic systems where early detection, quick response, and risk management can be achieved. In addition, cloud web-based solutions improve the storage of information while providing the predictive aspect for certainty of safety measures. This paper also largely focuses on such activities through the likes of ISO/IEC 30141 and IEEE 802.15.4, thus making a critical role in maintaining effective connectivity between IoT devices, which is necessary for the effective performance of fire safety systems. Furthermore, the implementation issues, including the high costs, the difficulty in scaling up the projects, and the cybersecurity concerns, are considered and compared to the possible solutions, which include upgrading in stages and the possibility of subsidies from the government. The review also points out areas for further study, such as the creation of small cell networks with lower latency, the use of AI to carry out the maintenance of IoTs, and the enhancement of protection mechanisms of systems that are based on the IoTs. In general, this paper highlights the vast possibilities offered by Industry 4.0 technologies to support organizational fire safety management or decrease fire fatalities and improve built environment fire safety.","[Negi, Prafful; Pathani, Ashish] Uttaranchal Univ, Uttaranchal Inst Technol, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Bhatt, Bhuvan Chandra] Uttarakhand Tech Univ, Shivalik Coll Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Swami, Siddharth] Doon Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Singh, Rajesh; Gehlot, Anita] Uttaranchal Univ, Div Res & Innovat, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Thakur, Amit Kumar; Gupta, Lovi Raj] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Phagwara 144401, India; [Priyadarshi, Neeraj] JIS Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Kolkata 741235, India; [Twala, Bhekisipho] Tshwane Univ Technol, Off DVC Digital Transformat, Staatsartillerie Rd, ZA-0183 Pretoria, South Africa; [Sikarwar, Vineet Singh] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Plasma Phys, Slovankou 1782-3, Prague 18200, Czech Republic; [Sikarwar, Vineet Singh] Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Power Engn, Tech 5, Prague 16628, Czech Republic","Uttaranchal University; Shivalik College of Engineering; Uttarakhand Technical University; Doon University; Uttaranchal University; Lovely Professional University; Tshwane University of Technology; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Plasma Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Sikarwar, VS (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Plasma Phys, Slovankou 1782-3, Prague 18200, Czech Republic.;Sikarwar, VS (corresponding author), Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Power Engn, Tech 5, Prague 16628, Czech Republic.",amit.25010@lpu.co.in; sikarwar@ipp.cas.cz,"Gehlot, Anita/HGD-3508-2022; Priyadarshi, Neeraj/AAZ-5821-2020; Twala, Bhekisipho/L-9505-2016; GUPTA, LOVI RAJ/HHS-4477-2022; Thakur, Amit/AAT-3872-2020; SIKARWAR, VINEET/L-5703-2014","swami, siddharth/0000-0001-5448-1637; SIKARWAR, VINEET/0000-0002-9999-5559; Gehlot, Anita/0000-0001-6463-9581","Digital Transformation Portfolio, Tshwane University of Technology","Digital Transformation Portfolio, Tshwane University of Technology","This research has received no external funding.

Indeed, besides the traditional clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, TNM stage), new omics data have recently been introduced in clinical practice, thereby making more complex the decision-making process. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, various omics datasets may be used to create more accurate predictive models paving the way for a better care in lung cancer patients.MethodsThe LANTERN study is a multi-center observational clinical trial involving a multidisciplinary consortium of five institutions from different European countries. The aim of this trial is to develop accurate several predictive models for lung cancer patients, through the creation of Digital Human Avatars (DHA), defined as digital representations of patients using various omics-based variables and integrating well-established clinical factors with genomic data, quantitative imaging data etc. A total of 600 lung cancer patients will be prospectively enrolled by the recruiting centers and multi-omics data will be collected. Data will then be modelled and parameterized in an experimental context of cutting-edge big data analysis. All data variables will be recorded according to a shared common ontology based on variable-specific domains in order to enhance their direct actionability. An exploratory analysis will then initiate the biomarker identification process. The second phase of the project will focus on creating multiple multivariate models trained though advanced machine learning (ML) and AI techniques for the specific areas of interest. Finally, the developed models will be validated in order to test their robustness, transferability and generalizability, leading to the development of the DHA. All the potential clinical and scientific stakeholders will be involved in the DHA development process. The main goals aim of LANTERN project are: i) To develop predictive models for lung cancer diagnosis and histological characterization; (ii) to set up personalized predictive models for individual-specific treatments; iii) to enable feedback data loops for preventive healthcare strategies and quality of life management.DiscussionThe LANTERN project will develop a predictive platform based on integration of multi-omics data. This will enhance the generation of important and valuable information assets, in order to identify new biomarkers that can be used for early detection, improved tumor diagnosis and personalization of treatment protocols.Ethics Committee approval number5420 - 0002485/23 from Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Ethics Committee.","[Lococo, Filippo; Boldrini, Luca; Evangelista, Jessica; Nero, Camilla; Minucci, Angelo; Vita, Emanuele; Cesario, Alfredo; Annunziata, Salvatore; Calcagni, Maria Lucia; Chiappetta, Marco; Cancellieri, Alessandra; Larici, Anna Rita; Cicchetti, Giuseppe; Leoncini, Fausto; Urbani, Andrea; Trisolini, Rocco; Bria, Emilio; Giordano, Alessandro; Rindi, Guido; Sala, Evis; Tortora, Giampaolo; Valentini, Vincenzo; Boccia, Stefania; Margaritora, Stefano; Scambia, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy; [Lococo, Filippo; Evangelista, Jessica; Flamini, Sara; Chiappetta, Marco; Margaritora, Stefano] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Thorac Surg Unit, Rome, Italy; [Boldrini, Luca; Diepriye, Charles-Davies; Valentini, Vincenzo] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Radiotherapy Unit, Rome, Italy; [Nero, Camilla; Scambia, Giovanni] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Dept Woman & Child Hlth & Publ Hlth, Div Oncol Gynecol, Rome, Italy; [Minucci, Angelo; De Paolis, Elisa] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Dept Unit Mol & Genom Diagnost, Genom Core Facil, Gemelli Sci & Technol Pk G STeP, Rome, Italy; [De Paolis, Elisa; Urbani, Andrea] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Clin Chem Biochem & Mol Biol Operat UOC, Rome, Italy; [Vita, Emanuele; Bria, Emilio; Tortora, Giampaolo] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Med Oncol, Largo A Gemelli 8, Rome, Italy; [Cesario, Alfredo] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Open Innovat, Sci Directorate, Rome, Italy; [Cesario, Alfredo] Gemelli Digital Med & Hlth Srl, Rome, Italy; [Annunziata, Salvatore; Calcagni, Maria Lucia; Giordano, Alessandro] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Nucl Med Unit, GsteP Radiopharm TracerGLab, Rome, Italy; [Cancellieri, Alessandra; Rindi, Guido] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Inst Pathol, Rome, Italy; [Larici, Anna Rita; Cicchetti, Giuseppe; Sala, Evis] A Gemelli Univ Hosp Fdn IRCCS, Adv Radiodiagnost Ctr, Dept Diagnost Imaging Oncol Radiotherapy & Hemato, Rome, Italy; [Troost, Esther G.

This approach is inspired by design-oriented research methodology. Designing an activity aimed at digital education has four stages: appropriating of the subject matter, stepping back oneself from the expert knowledge, defining the sequence of the activity, and creating educational materials. It is carried out collaboratively between researchers (activity designers), practitioners (teachers and children), and experts in media and computer science. This approach takes shape through two research projects aimed at 10 to 15-year-old children: a first project targeting artificial intelligence literacy and a second one, Internet security literacy. The AI literacy project is tested with 75 teachers-in-training, five teachers, and 85 children aged 10 to 15. The critical analysis of the approach is at interdisciplinarity and collaboration levels. The alliance of computer science education and digital media education makes it possible to give meaning to educational activities. Turnkey educational materials corresponding to the expectations of teachers, and the reality of a classroom, are created. However, the balance between the two axes is difficult to find. Moreover, this approach takes time and makes project management difficult.","[Julie, Henry; Alyson, Hernalesteen; Anne-Sophie, Collard] Univ Namur, Namur Digital Inst, Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Julie, H (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Namur Digital Inst, Namur, Belgium.",julie.henry@unamur.be; alyson.hernalesteen@unamur.be; anne-sophie.collard@unamur.be,,,,,,,9,5,5,1,10,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0190-5848,,978-1-7281-8961-1,PROC FRONT EDUC CONF,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BR3IP,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000646660800285,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the proposed regulation suffers from two important limitations: it is designed to benefit the whole population with limited consideration for individuals, and the generation of secondary datasets from heterogeneous, unlinked patient data will remain burdensome. AIDAVA, a Horizon Europe project that started in September 2022, proposes to address both shortcomings by providing patients with an AI-based virtual assistant that maximises automation in the integration and transformation of their health data into an interoperable, longitudinal health record. This personal record can then be used to inform patient-related decisions at the point of care, whether this is the usual point of care or a possible cross-border point of care. The personal record can also be used to generate population datasets for research and policymaking. The proposed solution will enable a much-needed paradigm shift in health data management, implementing a 'curate once at patient level, use many times' approach, primarily for the benefit of patients and their care providers, but also for more efficient generation of high-quality secondary datasets. After 15 months, the project shows promising preliminary results in achieving automation in the integration and transformation of heterogeneous data of each individual patient, once the content of the data sources managed by the data holders has been formally described. Additionally, the conceptualization phase of the project identified a set of recommendations for the development of a patient-centric EHDS, significantly facilitating the generation of data for secondary use.","[de Zegher, Isabelle] Bloba, Tervuren, Belgium; [Norak, Kerli; Lotmam, Eno-Martin] North Estonia Med Ctr, Tallinn, Estonia; [Norak, Kerli] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Steiger, Dominik] MIDATA Genossenschaft, Zurich, Switzerland; [Mueller, Heimo] Med Univ Graz, Diagnost & Res Inst Pathol, Graz, Austria; [Kalra, Dipak] European Inst Innovat Hlth Data, Ghent, Belgium; [Scheenstra, Bart] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Cina, Isabella] European Heart Network, Brussels, Belgium; [Shulz, Stefan] Averbis GmbH, Freiburg, Germany; [Shulz, Stefan] Med Univ Graz, Inst Med Informat Stat & Documentat, Graz, Austria; [Uma, Kanimozhi] HCI, Fac Engn Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Kalendralis, Petros] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, GROW Sch Oncol & Reprod, Dept Radiat Oncol Maastro, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Benedikt, Martin] Med Univ Graz, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Graz, Austria; [Dumontier, Michel; Celebi, Remzi] Maastricht Univ, Inst Data Sci, Dept Adv Comp Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands",Tallinn University of Technology; Medical University of Graz; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Medical University of Graz; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Medical University of Graz; Maastricht University,"de Zegher, I (corresponding author), Bloba, Tervuren, Belgium.",isabelle@dezegher.com,"Benedikt, Martin/LGZ-4506-2024; Uma, Kanimozhi/JEP-6389-2023","Uma, Kanimozhi/0000-0003-3584-9912; de zegher, isabelle/0000-0003-4514-7578; Celebi, Remzi/0000-0001-7769-4272; Lotman, Eno-Martin/0000-0002-7054-9571",European Union10.13039/501100000780,European Union10.13039/501100000780,"The authors are grateful to all the members of the AIDAVA consortium who diligently support the project with their expertise.

While the importance of applying such technologies has been widely recognized, they might not have been effectively discussed in the early design phase. As a widely applied planning and architecting tool, traditional Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) are not always able to meet requirements of urban development in an expected way. This might be alleviated by applying a smart city-oriented EAF which supports discussion of modern techniques in the early design phase. In the EU smart city project +CityxChange, an EAF was proposed to address such issues. In this article, we focus on an initial evaluation of the EAF proposed in the +Cityx-xChange project according to the Design Science Research (DSR) method. We discuss how the EAF has enhanced the widely used EAF (i.e., The Open Group Architecture Framework, TOGAF for short) by extending its layer-based Enterprise Architecture (EA). We also present a sample scenario demonstrating how the EAF can be used.","[Guo, Hong; Petersen, Sobah Abbas; Li, Jingyue; Bokolo, Anthony Junior] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Guo, Hong] Anhui Univ, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Gao, Shang] Orebro Univ, Orebro, Sweden",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Anhui University; Orebro University,"Guo, H (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway.;Guo, H (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Hefei, Peoples R China.",hong.guo@ntnu.no; sobah.a.petersen@ntnu.no; shang.gao@oru.se; jingyue.li@ntnu.no; Anthony.j.bokolo@ntnu.no,"Gao, Shang/AAZ-6489-2020; Anthony Jnr, Bokolo/K-9280-2016","Gao, Shang/0000-0002-3722-6797; Anthony Jnr, Bokolo/0000-0002-7276-0258; Li, Jingyue/0000-0002-7958-391X",European Union [824260]; European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics,European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics,"+CityxChange is a smart city project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 824260.

The operation of these reservoirs is not only affected by external effects such as natural flow conditions but is also related to the state of the reservoir project, the operating rules of the reservoirs and the operating mode of the discharge facilities. The realization of refined simulations that can consider various natural and engineering factors is of great significance to improve the reservoir management level. As a method to study the dynamic behavior of complex systems, system dynamics (SD) simulation models have the potential to realize the refined simulation of cascade reservoirs. However, when the SD model is controlled by deterministic rules, the various functional objectives of reservoirs cannot be weighed and emergent scenarios cannot be addressed. In this paper, a mechanical-artificial intelligence (AI) coupling modeling paradigm is proposed, in which the AI algorithm is used to extract adaptive operating rules, and the SD method is used to refined simulate the operations of cascade reservoirs, and the mechanism model and the AI algorithm are coupled to build the cascade reservoir adaptive refined (CRAR) simulation model. The example application shows that the proposed model can be used to effectively reflect the dynamic change in system operations and realize the refined simulation of system operations and adaptive scheduling decisions under various conditions. From this study, a new idea and a reference for the simulation of cascade reservoir operations are provided.","[Zhu, Boran; Liu, Jun; He, Huaijie; Feng, Qiong] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Boran; Lin, Junqiang; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Di; Peng, Qidong] China Inst Water Resource & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Boran; Lin, Junqiang; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Di; Peng, Qidong] Minist Water Resources, Key Lab River Basin Digital Twinning, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yufeng] Hubei Key Lab Intelligent Yangtze & Hydroelect Sci, Yichang 443002, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yufeng] China Yangtze Power Co Ltd, Yichang 443002, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jing] Huaneng Tibet Hydropower Safety Engn Technol Res C, Tibet 860000, Peoples R China",Hohai University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research,"Lin, JQ (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resource & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",junqiang-lin@hotmail.com,"Ren, yu/KYY-9101-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52192672]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFE0128500]; State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin [SKL2020ZY10]; Science and Technology Project of Huaneng Group Headquarters [HNKJ20-H26],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin; Science and Technology Project of Huaneng Group Headquarters,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 52192672) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (NO. 2018YFE0128500) , the State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (SKL2020ZY10) , the Science and Technology Project of Huaneng Group Headquarters (HNKJ20-H26) .",,71,7,7,10,71,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Effective extraction of drug indication information from free-text based resources could facilitate drug repositioning projects and help collect real-world evidence in support of secondary use of approved medicines. To enable AI-powered language models for the extraction of drug indication information, we used manual reading and curation to develop a Drug Indication Classification and Encyclopedia (DICE) based on FDA approved human prescription drug labeling. A DICE scheme with 7,231 sentences categorized into five classes (indications, contradictions, side effects, usage instructions, and clinical observations) was developed. To further elucidate the utility of the DICE, we developed nine different AI-based classifiers for the prediction of indications based on the developed DICE to comprehensively assess their performance. We found that the transformer-based language models yielded an average MCC of 0.887, outperforming the word embedding-based Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models (0.862) with a 2.82% improvement on the test set. The best classifiers were also used to extract drug indication information in DrugBank and achieved a high enrichment rate (>0.930) for this task. We found that domain-specific training could provide more explainable models without performance sacrifices and better generalization for external validation datasets. Altogether, the proposed DICE could be a standard resource for the development and evaluation of task-specific AI-powered, natural language processing (NLP) models.","[Bhatt, Arjun; Chen, Xi; Li, Ting; Connor, Skylar; Tong, Weida; Liu, Zhichao] US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA; [Bhatt, Arjun] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Bhatt, Arjun] East Carolina Univ, Sch Med, Brody Sch Med, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Roberts, Ruth] ApconiX Ltd, Alderley Edge, England; [Roberts, Ruth] Univ Birmingham, Dept Biosci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Hatim, Qais] US FDA, Off Translat Sci, Ctr Drug Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Mikailov, Mike] US FDA, Off Sci & Engn Labs, Ctr Devices & Radiol Hlth, Silver Spring, MD USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); Dartmouth College; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Birmingham; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Tong, WD; Liu, ZC (corresponding author), US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA.",weida.tong@fda.hhs.gov; Zhichao.liu@fda.hhs.gov,"Liu, Zhichao/C-4035-2011","Connor, Skylar/0000-0002-3347-9180; Li, Ting/0000-0003-2280-8433; , Xi/0000-0003-3459-4217",Summer Student Research Program (SSRP) at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR); U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/NCTR through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE),Summer Student Research Program (SSRP) at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR); U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/NCTR through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE),"AB is grateful to the support received from the Summer Student Research Program (SSRP) at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR).

One of the main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective data integration and management are a key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current complicated operating conditions, as well as taking into account the time, computing power, and constraints in the context of environmental injustice.","[Krupnova, Tatyana G.; Rakova, Olga, V; Bondarenko, Kirill A.; Tretyakova, Valeria D.] South Ural State Univ, Inst Nat Sci & Math, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia",South Ural State University,"Krupnova, TG (corresponding author), South Ural State Univ, Inst Nat Sci & Math, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.",krupnovatg@susu.ru; et2142bka04@susu.ru; et1932tvd22@susu.ru,"Rakova, Olga/ABC-5896-2020; Bondarenko, Kirill/KZU-1752-2024; Krupnova, Tatyana/N-4304-2014","Rakova, Olga/0000-0002-5788-5933; Krupnova, Tatyana/0000-0003-0862-710X",Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [FENU-2020-0022]; Russian Science Foundation (RSF) [22-17-20006],Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; Russian Science Foundation (RSF)(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (government order FENU-2020-0022); the study of metal-containing PM2.5 and PM10 air pollution monitoring was found by the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), project number 22-17-20006 (https://rscf.ru/en/project/22-17-20006/(accessed on 20 May 2022)) and Chelyabinsk region.",,57,10,10,9,51,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-2289,,BIG DATA COGN COMPUT,Big Data Cogn.

Global projects, such as the proposed global surveillance system for plant disease, will be strengthened by the integration of the wide range of new data, including data from tools like remote sensors, that are used to evaluate the risk of plant disease. There is exciting potential for the use of AI to strengthen global capacity building as well, from image analysis for disease diagnostics and associated management recommendations on farmers' phones to future training methodologies for plant pathologists that are customized in real-time for management needs in response to the current risks.

The authors collected information on sampled projects as case studies that were completed in the last 15 years where the authors had direct or indirect involvement. Project participants were then interviewed and asked to provide information that was then used to build a comprehensive data set with parameters for project size, location, type, contract conditions, duration, delivery method, delay analysis method, and awarded time. A total of ten (10) causes of delay were identified in a thorough review of twenty-one (21) projects. Climate conditions, lack of coordination, conflicts between stakeholders, poor communication, inadequate planning, material shortages, payment delays, workforce and equipment shortages, stakeholder interference, and poor site management were identified as the most common causes of delay globally. Some projects had a combination of causes, leading to a more severe overall impact. The findings of the study is that the use of advanced delay analysis methods such as time impact analysis (TIA) and window analysis have a higher chance of enabling contractors to prove time entitlement particularly when used under FIDIC contracts, with less entitlement likely to be awarded under Anglo-Saxon contracts. This study identifies a common set of parameters to govern the selection of an appropriate delay analysis method and provides construction project managers with a practical tool to determine how much time and resources to invest in any particular method. It discusses how delay analysis affects the rights of the parties, delay damages, prolongation costs, bonuses, acceleration costs, reimbursement for fluctuation of prices or exceptional circumstances. The study also identifies the consequences of the method's selection, the contractual and legal concerns that can be raised against it, and how such concerns can have an impact on decisions/awards.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance, including user surveys and data analysis. The results revealed that, on average, users experienced a 20% increase in satisfaction when using a chatbot to solve problems. For expert users, the increase in satisfaction was 12% in terms of efficiency. Additionally, a cost savings of 42.26% is projected, compared to hiring additional personnel. These findings highlight the importance of AI-based solutions in improving IT services.

It goes without saying that the network operators will experience the dynamic demands like never before owing to an extremely dynamic device layer i.e., IoT. An obvious consequence of this is the uncertainty in the demand estimation and capacity planning of the communication infrastructure. This paper studies the concept of dynamic demand estimation using AI approaches. We start with learning over the mobility and activity patterns of a single user and evaluate the performance of different machine learning (ML) approaches, for example, classification, regression, and clustering. We then move on to more realistic settings, where the learning is carried out for population and autonomous driving.

For this purpose, process quality is evaluated during a biennial audit of FBF-member studs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Additionally, two monitoring programs referring to sperm quality are implemented once-a-year.

Furthermore, a route management technique is combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to transmit the data to appropriate central servers. Therefore, the combined objective case studies are examined as minimization and maximization criteria, thus increasing the efficiency of the proposed method.

More akin to a call centre than a centralized control room, Nissan's 'Seamless Autonomous Mobility' (SAM) project imagines that remote 'mobility managers' will intervene in the decision-making of autonomous vehicles, with the assistance of live video streams and other sensor data. Different from other kinds of AI microwork in which human workers prepare, imitate, or verify AI, mobility managers are envisioned instead as 'interveners', meant to directly and actively intervene in the movements of 'autonomous' vehicles when unable to negotiate an obstacle. Firstly, through a comparison between SAM and a traffic management system in Los Angeles, I argue that the former 'normalizes' intervention, in which decision-making delays become ordinary, if not altogether desirable. Secondly, through an analysis of a video in which such normalized interventions are imagined, I consider how SAM offers a kind of speculative mundanity in which remote workers, enabled by a technological infrastructure, embody a novel logic that modifies the social settings of driving.","[Hind, Sam] Univ Siegen, SFB Media Of Cooperat 1187, Siegen, Germany",Universitat Siegen,"Hind, S (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, SFB Media Of Cooperat 1187, Siegen, Germany.",sam.hind@uni-siegen.de,,"Hind, Sam/0000-0001-8347-3695","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [262513311 -SFB 1187]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Project-ID 262513311 -SFB 1187.",,78,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,JUL 4,2022,17,4,,,,,467,483,,10.1080/17450101.2021.1988682,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2021.1988682,,OCT 2021,17,Geography; Transportation,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Transportation,3P4CR,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000711252600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prompt decision-making in relation to litigation is crucial, but the manual review of extensive document sets is time-consuming. In this paper, the natural language processing (NLP) technique was applied to litigation data to develop a model for case summarization and winner prediction. By automatically summarizing the data and predicting litigation outcomes, the proposed model aids practitioners in making timely decisions and enhances document management during disputes. This paper contributes to existing knowledge in two ways. Firstly, the model aids practitioners in making timely decisions about proceeding with litigation. Secondly, unlike previous studies that manually processed raw data such as contracts and specifications, this study utilized NLP to process raw litigation case data automatically. As big data becomes increasingly common, the methodology employed in this study holds academic significance.","[Seo, Wonkyoung] Univ Seoul, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Kang, Youngcheol] Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea",University of Seoul; Yonsei University,"Kang, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",wkseo@uos.ac.kr; yckang@yonsei.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea grant -Korean government Ministry of Education [NRF - 2021R1F1A1050519],"National Research Foundation of Korea grant -Korean government Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the (Korean government Ministry of Education) (NRF - 2021R1F1A1050519) .,,95,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

This study had been originally carried out as a project of a research proposed on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, from 1999 to 2004. This nationwide multicenter study on Ms included 3,672 cases with clinically diagnosed AIs, involving 1,874 males and 1,738 females, with mean age 58.1 +/- 13.0 years (mean +/- SD). In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the real prevalence of various adrenal disorders with Al. The mean nodule size of AI based on computed tomography was 3.0 +/- 2.0 cm. Compared to non-functioning adenomas (NFAs), tumor diameters were significantly larger in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), pheochromocytomas, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), myelolipomas, metastatic tumors, cysts, and ganglioneuromas (p < 0.01). Endocrinological evaluations demonstrated that 50.8% of total AIs were non-functioning adenomas, while 10.5%, including 3.6% with subclinical Cushing's syndrome, were reported as CPAs, 8.5% as pheochromocytomas, and 5.1% as aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACCs were accounted for 1.4% (50 cases) among our series of AIs. In conclusion, while almost 50 % of AIs are non-functional adenomas, we must be particularly careful as AIs include pheochromocytomas or adrenal carcinomas, because they may be asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest investigation of AI, thus providing basic information for the establishment of clinical guidelines for the management of AI.","[Ichijo, Takamasa] Saiseikai Yokohamashi Tobu Hosp, Dept Diabet & Endocrinol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300012, Japan; [Ueshiba, Hajime] Toho Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Diabet Metab & Endocrinol, Sch Med, Tokyo 1438541, Japan; [Nawata, Hajime] Muta Hosp, Fukuoka 8140163, Japan; [Yanase, Toshihiko] Fukuoka Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet Mellitus, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan",Toho University; Fukuoka University,"Ichijo, T (corresponding author), Saiseikai Yokohamashi Tobu Hosp, Dept Diabet & Endocrinol, Tsurumi Ku, 3-6-1 Shimosueyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300012, Japan.",t_ichijo@tobu.saiseikai.or.jp,,,"Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants, Research on Intractable Diseases, Research Committee on Disorders of Adrenal Hormones from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan [16769897, H29-Nanji-Ippan-046]","Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants, Research on Intractable Diseases, Research Committee on Disorders of Adrenal Hormones from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan","This study was partly supported by Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants, Research on Intractable Diseases, Research Committee on Disorders of Adrenal Hormones from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan (No. 16769897, No. H29-Nanji-Ippan-046).",,40,54,57,2,7,JAPAN ENDOCRINE SOC,KYOTO,"75 YANAGINOBANBA NISHIIRU-MASUYA-CHO, SANJOU-DORI, NAKAGYOU-KU, KYOTO, 604-8111, JAPAN",0918-8959,1348-4540,,ENDOCR J,Endocr.

Although the benefit of PFO closure in selected patients has been demonstrated, our system workflow still resulted in a low rate of PFO evaluation for closure. The aim of the PFO-ACCESS (Augmenting Communications for Medical Care or Closure in the Evaluation of Stroke Patients With Cardiac Shunts) program (which included implementation of the Viz.ai PFO-specific communications module) was to determine if there was any change in PFO management due to improved communication between stroke and interventional cardiology teams. Methods: In this quality improvement project, we compared pre-PFO ACCESS (December 2022-November 2023) to post-PFO ACCESS periods (November 2023-June 2024) regarding PFO evaluations. The Viz.ai PFO module was implemented for the stroke and interventional cardiology teams without other workflow changes. Key performance indicators included referral frequency, PFO closure rates, and referral time intervals. Statistical comparisons utilized Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, Fisher's exact, and exact Poisson test where appropriate. Results: The postimplementation period noted a 492% PFO referral increase (11 versus 38,65 [annualized]; P<0.0001). PFO closure number totals showed a 186% nonsignificant increase pre versus post (6 versus 10,17 [annualized]; P = 0.99), with PFO closure of percentage of total referred cases showing a large but nonsignificant decrease (54.55%, 26.32%; P = 0.14). Time comparisons showed a marked but nonsignificant decrease in median referral sent to referral viewed (10:37 hours, 1:08 hours; P = 0.73), referral sent to referral accepted (10:37 hours, 1:03 hours; P = 0.67) time interval, and referral sent to closure time interval (102 days, 97 days; P = 0.55). Conclusion: The PFO-ACCESS program with Viz.ai PFO module use resulted in a 492% increase in PFO referrals due to enhanced communication and efficiency in managing PFO-related stroke cases. Though the increased number of referrals and closures were observed, the PFO closure percentage of total referred cases showed a marked but nonsignificant decrease indicating selective case management. The higher number of PFO closures shows that more patients are indeed appropriate for PFO closure consideration. Future efforts should focus on expanding outpatient use and increasing provider education to optimize PFO management.","[Pirahanchi, Yasaman; Shifflett, Benjamin; Meyer, Dawn M.; Mortin, Melissa; Hailey, Lovella; Bowers, Jeffrey; Ravi, Vikas; Carrion, Julian; Bavarsad, Reza; Agrawal, Kunal; Modir, Royya; Hemmen, Thomas; Meyer, Brett C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurosci, MON 3rd fl,Suite 3,200 W Arbor Dr, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Mahmud, Ehtisham; Brennan, Stefanie] Univ Calif San Diego, Cardiovasc Med, San Diego, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Meyer, BC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Neurosci, MON 3rd fl,Suite 3,200 W Arbor Dr, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",bcmeyer@health.ucsd.edu,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2694-5746,,,STROKE-VASC INTERV N,Stroke-Vasc.

Machine learning techniques, including random forest and hierarchical clustering, were employed to transfer calibrated parameters from gauged to ungauged watersheds. Validation of parameter transfer over gauged SWAT model projects showed that 88% of the projects achieved calibrated status (KGE >= 0.5; PBIAS <= 25%). Additional validation using MODIS satellite evapotranspiration measurements confirmed the robustness of the approach. Results indicated that the proposed approach successfully captures physical similarities, and effectively captures flow patterns.

This study examines the written material of popular tourist sites along B&R and the tourism assets from the viewpoint of B&R, based on the wireless network and AI technology, and using a big data platform and the Internet of Things (IoT) User Generated Content (UGC) network structure. To manage tourist pictures from customers' views, online travel notes are first utilized as examples. Next, tourism texts' keywords are extracted using Python big data and AI technology to understand consumers' perceptions of scenic spot preferences, tourism facilities and services, and social and cultural customs. The findings demonstrate that, when compared to the conventional tourism brand development strategy, the integrated development strategy based on the AI big data platform can not only increase the effectiveness of managing tourists' perceptions of scenic locations but can also encourage the common development of national sports event components and intelligent tourism image management. Several sports tourist boutique picturesque locations have also been built along B&R following years of development of intelligent tourism and sports projects, which will strengthen the effect of multicultural exchanges.","[Cao, Peng] Guilin Tourism Univ, Sch Leisure & Hlth, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Jing] Guilin Tourism Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Guilin Tourism University; Guilin Tourism University,"Xiao, J (corresponding author), Guilin Tourism Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",jingxiao9423@gmail.com,"Xiao, Jing/AAB-1015-2020",,,,,,10,0,0,19,28,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1064-1246,1875-8967,,J INTELL FUZZY SYST,J.

Public health officials will learn about emerging threats detected by the center and get recommendations on how to respond. The virtual center is structured with three parallel teams: detection, evidence, and response. The detection team will employ a mixture of advanced search que-ries, machine learning, and other AI techniques to sift through more than 800 million new public social media posts per day to identify emerging infodemic threats in both English and Spanish. The evidence team will use the EasySearch federated search engine backed by AI, PAHO's knowledge management team, and the Librar-ian Reserve Corps to identify the most relevant authoritative sources.

DAVE integrates directly with Autodesk Revit through Python scripts, the Revit API, and the OpenAI API and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study presents (1) the development of a practical AI chatbot application that leverages conversational AI and BIM for dynamic actions within BIM models (e.g., updates and queries) at any stage of a construction project and (2) the demonstration of real-time, multimodal BIM model management through voice or text, which aims to reduce the complexity and technical barriers typically associated with BIM processes. The details of DAVE's development and system architecture are outlined in this paper.

Not surprisingly, it comes at a time when higher traffic demand and more stringent and diverse network requirements result in diminishing benefits for operators using complex AI-driven network optimization solutions. In this paper, we propose the idea of tower companies that facilitate radio access network (RAN) infrastructure sharing between operators and evaluate the additional energy savings obtained in this process. In particular, we focus on the RAN-as-a-Service (RANaaS) implementation, wherein each operator leases and controls an independent logical RAN instance running on the shared infrastructure. We show how an AI system can assist operators in optimizing their share of resources under multiple constraints. This paper aims to provide a vision, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the RANaaS paradigm, and its benefits in terms of energy efficiency. Through simulations, we show the possibility to achieve up to 75 percent energy savings per operator over 24 h compared to the scenario where none of the energy-saving features are activated. This is an additional 55 percent energy savings from sharing the RAN infrastructure compared to the baseline scenario where the operators use independent hardware.","[Peesapati, Saivenkata Krishna Gowtam; Olsson, Magnus; Andersson, Soren; Qvarfordt, Christer; Dahlen, Anders] Huawei Technol Sweden AB, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden",Huawei Technologies,"Peesapati, SKG (corresponding author), Huawei Technol Sweden AB, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden.",svkgpe@kth.se,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-4001,,TELECOM,Telecom,JUN,2023,4,2,,,,,334,368,,10.3390/telecom4020020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/telecom4020020,,,35,Telecommunications,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Telecommunications,CC4N1,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001123039000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Energy engineering is a relatively new technical discipline. It is increasingly considered as a significant step in meeting carbon reduction targets, which can produce a variety of appealing outcomes that are useful to humanity's evolution. Many countries have adopted national policies to decrease pollution by reducing fossil fuel use and increasing renewable energy usage by alleviating climate change (wind and solar, etc.). The ever-growing need for renewable sources has led to economic and technological problems, such as wind energy, essential for effective grid control, and the design of a wind project. Precise estimates offer network operators and power system designers vital information for the generation of an appropriate wind turbine and controlling demand and supply power. This work provides an in-depth study of the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the prediction of wind energy generation. The devices employed to calculate wind speed are examined and discussed, with a focus on studies recently published. This review's findings show that AI is being employed in power wind energy measurement and forecasts. When compared to individual systems, the hybrid AI system gives more accurate findings. The discussion also found that correct handling and calibration of the anemometer can increase predicting accuracy. This conclusion suggests that increasing the accuracy of wind forecasting can be accomplished by lowering equipment errors that measure the meteorological parameter and mitigate carbon emission.","[Zhao, Lijun] Hebei Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Nazir, Muhammad Shahzad] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Fac Automat Engn, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China; [Nazir, Hafiz M.

Accurate diagnosis of these lesions is crucial for effective patient management, especially in dermatology, where visual assessment plays a central role. Incorrect diagnoses can result in mismanagement, delays in appropriate interventions, and potential harm. AI, however, holds the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide reliable support to clinicians. This work aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of machine learning (logistic regression of lesion features and patient metadata) and deep learning (CNN analysis of images) models in dermoscopy diagnosis and the management of aPFLs. This study involved the analysis of 1197 dermoscopic images of facial lesions excised due to suspicious and histologically confirmed malignancy, classified into seven classes (lentigo maligna-LM; lentigo maligna melanoma-LMM; atypical nevi-AN; pigmented actinic keratosis-PAK; solar lentigo-SL; seborrheic keratosis-SK; and seborrheic lichenoid keratosis-SLK). Image samples were collected through the Integrated Dermoscopy Score (iDScore) project. The statistical analysis of the dataset shows that the patients mean age was 65.5 +/- 14.2, and the gender was equally distributed (580 males-48.5%; 617 females-51.5%). A total of 41.7% of the sample constituted malignant lesions (LM and LMM). Meanwhile, the benign lesions were mainly PAK (19.3%), followed by SL (22.2%), AN (10.4%), SK (4.0%), and SLK (2.3%). The lesions were mainly localised in the cheek and nose areas. A stratified analysis of the assessment provided by the enrolled dermatologists was also performed, resulting in 2445 evaluations of the 1197 images (2.1 evaluations per image on average). The physicians demonstrated higher accuracy in differentiating between malignant and benign lesions (71.2%) than in distinguishing between the seven specific diagnoses across all the images (42.9%). The logistic regression model obtained a precision of 39.1%, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 33.9%, and an accuracy of 53.6% on the test set, while the CNN model showed lower sensitivity (58.2%) and higher precision (47.0%), specificity (90.8%), and accuracy (59.5%) for melanoma diagnosis. This research demonstrates how AI can enhance the diagnostic accuracy in complex dermatological cases like aPFLs by integrating AI models with clinical data and evaluating different diagnostic approaches, paving the way for more precise and scalable AI applications in dermatology, showing their critical role in improving patient management and the outcomes in dermatology.","[Cartocci, Alessandra; Tognetti, Linda; Cinotti, Elisa; Rubegni, Pietro] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurosci, Dermatol Unit, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Luschi, Alessio; Cevenini, Gabriele; Iadanza, Ernesto] Univ Siena, Dept Med Biotechnol, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Farnetani, Francesca; Longo, Caterina] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Dermatol, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Lallas, Aimilios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Dermatol 1, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Paoli, John] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Univ Hosp, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Dermatol & Venereol,Inst Clin Sci, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Paoli, John] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, S-41345 Gothenburg, Region Vastra G, Sweden; [Longo, Caterina] IRCCS Reggio Emilia, Ctr Oncol ad Alta Tecnol Diagnost, Azienda Unita Sanit Locale, I-42123 Reggio Emilia, Italy; [Moscarella, Elvira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dermatol Unit, Naples, Italy; [Tiodorovic, Danica] Univ Nis, Med Fac, Dermatol Clin, Nish 18000, Serbia; [Stanganelli, Ignazio] Ist Romagnolo Studio Tumori, Sci Inst Romagna Study Canc, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Skin Canc Unit, Meldola, Italy; [Stanganelli, Ignazio] Univ Parma, Dept Dermatol, I-43121 Parma, Italy; [Suppa, Mariano] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Hop Erasme, Dept Dermatol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Suppa, Mariano] Soc Francaise Dermatol, Grp Imagerie Cutanee Noninvas, F-75009 Paris, France; [Suppa, Mariano] Inst Jules Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Dika, Emi] Azienda Osped Univ Bologna, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Oncol Dermatol Unit, I-40138 Bologna, Italy; [Dika, Emi] Univ Bologna, Dept Med & Surg Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Zalaudek, Iris] Osped Trieste, Dermatol Clin, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Pizzichetta, Maria Antonietta] Ctr Riferimento Oncol Aviano, Dept Med Oncol, I-33081 Aviano, Italy; [Perrot, Jean Luc] Univ Hosp St Etienne, Dermatol Unit, F-42270 St Etienne, France; [Rubegni, Giovanni] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurosci, Ophthalmol Unit, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Kittler, Harald; Tschandl, Philipp] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Dermatol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Siena; University of Siena; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Nis; University of Parma; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Institut Jules Bordet; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Bologna; IRCCS Aviano (CRO); CHU de St Etienne; University of Siena; Medical University of Vienna,"Luschi, A (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Med Biotechnol, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",alessio.luschi@unisi.it; emi.dika3@unibo.it,"Tognetti, Linda/AEU-3564-2022; Suppa, Mariano/ACS-7792-2022; Luschi, Alessio/AAD-3501-2021; Cinotti, Elisa/AAC-2512-2022; Lallas, Aimilios/O-4986-2019; Kittler, Harald/AAK-1502-2020; Dika, Emi/J-2638-2012; Iadanza, Ernesto/C-4211-2008; Paoli, John/P-7629-2018; Cartocci, Alessandra/AAB-5831-2020; CEVENINI, Gabriele/S-1973-2018","Cinotti, Elisa/0000-0002-4009-0659; Dika, Emi/0000-0003-3186-2861; Iadanza, Ernesto/0000-0002-7291-4990; Paoli, John/0000-0003-1326-8535; LUSCHI, ALESSIO/0000-0002-7615-9187; KITTLER, HARALD/0000-0002-0051-8016; Lallas, Aimilios/0000-0002-7193-0964; Tognetti, Linda/0000-0002-6691-4310; Perrot, Jean -Luc/0000-0003-4479-9961; Cartocci, Alessandra/0000-0002-1818-6275; CEVENINI, Gabriele/0000-0002-7212-573X",,,,,28,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5354,,BIOENGINEERING-BASEL,Bioengineering-Basel,OCT,2024,11,10,,,,,,,1036,10.3390/bioengineering11101036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering11101036,,,15,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering,K3O4K,39451411,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001343001300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper examines the challenges in applying FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to a collection containing first-hand testimonies and digitised objects of significant sentimental value, addressing both practical and ethical considerations, including the management of copyright, handling of sensitive material, use of AI tools and adherence to good research data management practices, with limited resources. Reflecting on the importance of a caring approach to data stewardship, the paper examines how the ethos of the Their Finest Hour project, and its commitment to honouring contributors and their families, led organically to an alignment with CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles, originally developed for Indigenous data governance. It also explores the potential for the wider application of CARE principles for crowdsourced collections such as the Their Finest Hour Online Archive, while acknowledging and respecting the origins of this framework. Lastly, it offers some practical 'lessons learned' to help GLAM and Higher Education professionals working with crowdsourced collections and personal histories to navigate some of the research data management challenges that they may encounter, while also highlighting the importance of understanding FAIR and CARE principles and how they can be applied to these types of data collections.","[Conisbee, Catherine] Univ Oxford, Bodleian Lib, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Conisbee, C (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Bodleian Lib, Oxford, England.",catherine.conisbee@bodleian.ox.ac.uk,,"Conisbee, Catherine/0009-0005-1881-5392",,,,,23,1,1,0,0,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,LONDON,"Unit 3N, 6 Osborn Street, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND",,2059-481X,,J OPEN HUMANIT DATA,J.

These technologies use sensor and IoT data to provide individualized, responsive, and effective assistance for elderly people. Many obstacles prevent these systems from reaching their full potential. Training data quality and representativeness are major issues. Collecting broad and reliable datasets that represent older people's real-world experiences is vital yet challenging. The ethical and technological challenges of protecting senior users' sensitive data are very high. To offer accurate and contextually relevant replies, multimodal data from aural, visual, and tactile sources must be seamlessly integrated. Maintaining robots' physical and cognitive ergonomics for natural and intuitive interactions is another design challenge. This study offers an AI-driven HRI system to improve senior care to solve these issues. Creating powerful AI models that can learn from high-quality, diversified datasets and combining multimodal data processing approaches to increase robotic caregiver accuracy and responsiveness are the goals. To employ the robots safely and ethically in geriatric care, the project will improve their physical design and apply strong data privacy and security safeguards.

In this project, EC is viewed as a society of software agents, such as customer, search, catalog, manufacturer, dealer, delivery and banker agents, interacting and negotiating with each other. Each agent has a knowledge-base and a reasoning engine, a communication engine and a documentation engine. The knowledge-base is organized in three layers: skill layer, rule layer and knowledge layer (S-R-K layers). In this project, for each EC agent, we identify the class of problems to be solved and build the knowledge base gradually for each layer. We believe that using this multi-layer knowledge base system will speed up the reasoning and ultimately reduce the operation costs.","Saitama Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan",Saitama University,"Far, BH (corresponding author), Saitama Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan.",,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,3,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG MINATO-KU SHIBAKOEN 3 CHOME, TOKYO, 105, JAPAN",0916-8532,,,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

With the expansion of policies to increase the share of railway transportation as an environmentally sustainable means of transportation that meets the needs of the carbon-neutral era, 3D digital information is required throughout the entire chain of railway construction, route selection, status analysis, design, construction, and maintenance. The need for scientific and rational decision making is increasing. In this study, based on point cloud data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a handheld mobile device, the landscape infrastructure around a railway was digitally converted, and a railway Landscape Information Model (LIM) process that modeled various types of landscape information was derived. Additionally, through the voxelization of 3D data, information regarding a railway's surrounding environment, analyzed as a 3D volume concept and a convergence plan with deep-learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) technology, was presented through object recognition using a clustering algorithm. A railway LIM dataset could be created from a total of seven major categories, and massive data processing through AI convergence will be a future possibility through optimization of the point cloud data clustering algorithm. The future of the railway industry requires the establishment of a railway LIM for the integrated management of a railway's surrounding environment and building information modeling (BIM) of structures such as tunnels. The railway LIM process has potential for use in various fields, such as environmental management and safety improvement for disaster prevention.","[Kim, Min-kyeong; Chung, Jeong-Duk] Korea Railrd Res Inst KRRI, Railrd Test & Certificat Div, Cheoldo Bangmulgwan Ro, Uiwang Si 16105, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Duckshin] Korea Railrd Res Inst KRRI, Transportat Environm Res Div, Cheoldo Bangmulgwan Ro, Uiwang Si 16105, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Yun, Suhwan; Park, Won-Hee; Lee, Duckhee] Korea Railrd Res Inst KRRI, Railrd Accid Res Dept, Cheoldo Bangmulgwan Ro, Uiwang Si 16105, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Chung, Kyung-Jin] Huron Network Co Ltd, 505,5 Gunpocheomdansaneop2-Ro 22Beon Gil, Gunpo Si 10285, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",,"Chung, KJ (corresponding author), Huron Network Co Ltd, 505,5 Gunpocheomdansaneop2-Ro 22Beon Gil, Gunpo Si 10285, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ckj007@hanmail.net,,"Park, Duckshin/0000-0002-5871-2049; Kim, Min kyeong/0000-0003-3156-6114",National Research Council of Science and Technology (Drone-LiDAR-based Railway Project Environmental Impact Assessment Digitization Convergence Cluster) [RP22138B]; AI-Based Development of Technology [RS-2019-KA152306]; Internationalization of the Conformity Assessment System and Establishment of the Safety Monitoring system for the Smart Railway system on the Test Line [PK2304C1],National Research Council of Science and Technology (Drone-LiDAR-based Railway Project Environmental Impact Assessment Digitization Convergence Cluster); AI-Based Development of Technology; Internationalization of the Conformity Assessment System and Establishment of the Safety Monitoring system for the Smart Railway system on the Test Line,"This study was conducted with funding from the National Research Council of Science and Technology (Drone-LiDAR-based Railway Project Environmental Impact Assessment Digitization Convergence Cluster, RP22138B) and conducted with funding the AI-Based Development of Technology to Reduce Exposure of Subway Users to Particulate Matter program(RS-2019-KA152306) and Internationalization of the Conformity Assessment System and Establishment of the Safety Monitoring system for the Smart Railway system on the Test Line (PK2304C1).",,19,2,2,11,50,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-446X,,DRONES-BASEL,Drones-Basel,MAR,2023,7,3,,,,,,,167,10.3390/drones7030167,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/drones7030167,,,17,Remote Sensing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Remote Sensing,D4JW5,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000968420000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These systems are considered as the intersection point between the smart grid and the smart home. Indeed, they can communicate with the user, home appliances, on-site generation sources, storage devices, and the grid operator to make dynamic decisions enabling intelligent and efficient energy management. This work aims to design and implement a smart HEMS that ensures renewable energy integration and energy efficiency improvement in residential buildings. The system designed in this work has been implemented as part of a pilot project in a testbed house of the Smart Campus - Green & Smart Building Park, Benguerir, Morocco. The proposed HEMS framework is based on two control strategies that work jointly: the first concerns the scheduling and control of power dispatch among generation, consumption, and storage agents (Supply-Side Management), while the second concerns the scheduling and control of flexible appliances for optimal load profile modulation (Demand-Side Management). The management of energy flows is based on grid electricity price, forecasting data (PV generation and weather conditions) and user preferences. The two designed control strategies are combined into an AI-based multi-objective optimization algorithm that minimizes costs and maximizes comfort level simultaneously. The obtained results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and indicate that it would significantly increase the penetration of PV energy for self-consumption and reduce electricity costs, while ensuring a proper compromise between monetary spending and comfort level. The large-scale implementation of such systems would help decarbonize residential energy sector through higher renewable energy integration and energy efficiency improvement in buildings.

Conventionally, for these applications, manufacturer's power curves are used in estimating the velocity-power characteristics of the turbines. However, performance of the turbines under actual field environments may significantly differ from the manufacturer's power curves, which are derived under 'standard' conditions. In case of existing wind projects with sufficient performance data, the velocity-power variations can better be defined using artificially intelligent models. In this paper, we compare the performance of four such models by applying them to a 2-MW onshore wind turbine. Models based on ANN, KNN, SVM and MARS were developed and tested using the SCADA data collected from the turbine. All the AI models performed significantly better than the manufacturer's power curve. Among the AI methods, SVM-based predictions showed the highest accuracy. A site-specific performance curve for the turbine, based on the SVM model, is presented. Wider adaptability of this approach has been demonstrated by successfully implementing the model for a 3.6-MW wind turbine, working under offshore environment. Being site-specific data driven, the proposed models are more accurate and hence better choice for applications like short-term wind power forecasting and pro-diagnostics of wind turbines.","[Veena, R.; Petra, M.

Design: Using linear regression, we assessed the relationships between serious psychological distress and HbA1c and BMI at baseline and one year later. Setting, Participants, and Intervention: AI/AN participants were aged >= 18 years, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and enrolled in the Special Diabetes Project for Indians Healthy Heart Project. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were percentage of HbA1c and BMI, measured at enrollment and first annual exam. Both outcomes were continuous measures in all analyses. Results: Serious psychological distress was associated at baseline with increased HbA1c in the unadjusted and adjusted models (adjusted b=.17%, P<0.01). Serious psychological distress also was associated at baseline with increased BMI (.635 kg/m(2), P=.01) and at one year with increased BMI (0.174 kg/m(2), P=.01) in the unadjusted model. After adjustment for demographic and health characteristics, these relationships were no longer significant. Conclusions: Cross-sectional baseline findings are consistent with existing literature. One-year findings suggest need for further inquiry into mediators of psychological distress and examination of additional diabetes-specific health outcomes.

In this paper three artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are integrated to model the resource allocation decision process, and the solution for a three-level decentralized organization is illustrated. The techniques are (1) the filtered beam search, which selects a list of potential projects at the subordinate level, (2) the world model, which describes the ordinate and superordinate's worlds and their decision-making processes, and (3) the blackboard model, which allows for global, but selective, storage of information. Benefits of the new approach include: several different mechanisms of managerial control may be modelled, the true information flow in an organization is more closely mirrored, and problems of a more realistic size are now viable. There are three primary ways in which the new model could be useful to management: The desirability and effects of different organizational structures can be modeled, the efficacy of various coordination mechanisms along the organizational structure can be examined, and a subset of projects from a wider list of possibilities can be selected. Also, an example is given showing how the model may be extended to scenarios with asymetric information and divergence of preferences, whereby subordinates have different objectives than their managers and where there is no way for managers to verify the truthfulness of their subordinates' responses.","VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV,R B PAMPLIN COLL BUSINESS ADM,DEPT MANAGEMENT SCI,BLACKSBURG,VA 24061; CENT CONNECTICUT STATE UNIV,DEPT MIS,NEW BRITAIN,CT 06053",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University,"LEU, YY (corresponding author), CALIF STATE UNIV SAN MARCOS,COLL BUSINESS ADM,SAN MARCOS,CA 92096, USA.",,,,,,,,19,1,2,0,11,"DECISION SCIENCES INST, GEORGIA STATE UNIV",ATLANTA,"COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMN, UNIVERSITY PLAZA, ATLANTA, GA 30303",0011-7315,,,DECISION SCI,Decis.

The majority of NIL algorithms is industry-neutral and business process agnostic. ML innovation is propelled by publicly available research, which gets harvested into Open Source for wide distribution through software and Cloud vendors. Ongoing Al technology work creates an immense source of assets for data-driven modeling, delivered as software libraries. However, the application of these assets for data monetization in finance does not happen with nearly comparable success or speed. The latter challenge is commonly known as the scalability problem of AI. As new techniques continue to grow vigorously, the investment from large finance institutions to cost-effectively produce applications for a variety of lines-of-business (LoBs) and business processes will increase. The availability of ML capabilities on Public (loud is a way for enterprises to increase productivity by benefiting from the best AI assets available from providers and startups. But data is constrained in terms of location, access and use in most finance competences by either laws or internal Governance, Risk and Compliance (CRC) rules. Legal limitations include, and go beyond, Privacy Acts, impacting non-retail processes where AI techniques must be explained in layperson language to decision-makers and regulators before field deployment. The latter is not yet achieved satisfactorily. Lastly, a large percentage of AI projects fail, in part due to unsuitable ML modeling for analytics and forecasting problems in finance. The variety and complexity of human behavior present in most finance processes calls for understanding AI at a level of cognitive depth that has no precedent in other industries. It is imperative that AI be approached so that finance competence and functional specificity are embedded a-priori into ML techniques and not as use-case afterthoughts. For acceleration of AI assessments, it is critical that ML techniques available in software implement models readily aligned to finance problems. This paper presents an approach to building an Architecture for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Finance by focusing on analytics and forecasting for business-to-business operations. This AI Architecture hinges on three axes and their interplay: Design Dimensions, Modeling Building-Blocks and Work-Practice. The goal is to support finance practitioners navigate the plethora of AI . options more effectively and accelerate data monetization. While ML techniques in data analytics and forecasting apply to many scenarios, this paper focuses on selected competences in Banking, Financial Markets and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) operations. The architecture and method introduced in this paper is a first step toward a service practice. We harvest from our work carried out in banks, asset management firms and CEO lines-of-business as well as R&D experiences in new finance technologies for over one decade.

J,"Serrano, W",,,,"Serrano, Will",,,Verification and Validation for data marketplaces via a blockchain and smart contracts,BLOCKCHAIN-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Data marketplace; Project information model; Smart cities; Smart buildings; Real estate; Distributed ledger technology; Blockchain; Smart contracts; Artificial intelligence,MODELS,"Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient re-cord of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intel-ligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)-Real Estate-PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).","[Serrano, Will] Bartlett Univ Coll London, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Serrano, W (corresponding author), Bartlett Univ Coll London, London WC1E 6BT, England.",w.serrano@ucl.ac.uk,,"Serrrano, Will/0000-0002-4000-1572",,,,,69,11,11,4,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2096-7209,,,BLOCKCHAIN-RES APPL,Blockchain-Res.

In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, end-to-end performance analysis and optimization will be key features to effectively manage the diverse requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries over the same shared infrastructure. To enable such a vision, the MARSAL project targets the development and evaluation of a complete framework for the management and orchestration of network resources in 5G and beyond, by utilizing a converged optical-wireless network infrastructure in the access and fronthaul/midhaul segments. At the network design domain, MARSAL targets the development of novel cell-free based solutions by exploiting the application of the distributed cell-free concept and of the serial fronthaul approach, while contributing innovative functionalities to the O-RAN project. In parallel, in the fronthaul/midhaul segments MARSAL aims to radically increase the flexibility of optical access architectures via different levels of fixed-mobile convergence. At the network and service management domain, the design philosophy of MARSAL is to exploit novel ML-based algorithms of both edge and midhaul DCs, by incorporating the Virtual Elastic DataCenters/Infrastructures paradigm. Finally, at the network security domain, MARSAL aims to introduce mechanisms that provide privacy and security to application workload and data, targeting to allow applications and users to maintain control over their data, while AI and and Blockchain technologies will be developed in order to guarantee a secured multi-tenant slicing environment.","[Vardakas, John S.; Ramantas, Kostas; Datsika, Eftychia] Iquadrat Informat S L, Barcelona, Spain; [Payaro, Miquel; Verikoukis, Christos] Telecommunicat Technol Ctr Catalonia CTTC, CERCA, Castelldefels, Spain; [Pollin, Sofie; Vinogradov, Evgenii] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Leuven, Belgium; [Varvarigos, Manos; Kokkinos, Panagiotis] NTUA, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens, Greece; [Gonzalez-Sanchez, Roberto] NEC Labs Europe, Madrid, Spain; [Olmos, Juan Jose Vegas] NVidia Mellanox, Roskilde, Denmark; [Chochliouros, Ioannis] OTE Res, Omilos OTE, Athens, Greece; [Chanclou, Philippe] Orange Labs, Fixed Access Networks Grp, Lannion, France; [Samarati, Pierangela] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Flizikowski, Adam; Rahman, Md Arifur] IS Wireless, Piaseczno, Poland",KU Leuven; National Technical University of Athens; NEC Corporation; Orange SA; University of Milan,"Vardakas, JS (corresponding author), Iquadrat Informat S L, Barcelona, Spain.",jvardakas@iquadrat.com; kramantas@iquadrat.com; edatsika@iquadrat.com; miquel.payaro@cttc.es; sofie.pollin@esat.kuleuven.be; evgenii.vinogradov@esat.kuleuven.be; vmanos@mail.ntua.gr; kokkinop@central.ntua.gr; roberto.gonzalez@neclab.eu; juanj@mellanox.com; ichochliouros@oteresearch.gr; philippe.chanclou@orange.com; pierangela.samarati@unimi.it; a.flizikowski@is-wireless.com; a.rahman@is-wireless.com; cveri@cttc.es,"Flizikowski, Adam/JVM-9827-2024; Chanclou, Philippe/X-2562-2019; Rahman, Arifur/I-8296-2019; Pollin, Sofie/JDH-5305-2023; Vinogradov, Evgenii/P-3107-2019; Vardakas, John/E-3776-2014","Chanclou, Philippe/0000-0002-9655-0351; Vinogradov, Evgenii/0000-0002-4156-0317; Varvarigos, Emmanouel/0000-0002-4942-1362; Flizikowski, Adam/0000-0002-7173-6360",EU research project MARSAL [101017171],EU research project MARSAL,This work is supported by the EU research project MARSAL (101017171).,,15,8,8,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-4505-4,,,,2021,,,,,,,488,493,,10.1109/MeditCom49071.2021.9647671,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MeditCom49071.2021.9647671,,,6,Telecommunications,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Telecommunications,BT8DG,,Green Submitted,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000852833400093,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we present the smart, trustworthy and liable 5G security platform being designed and developed in the INSPIRE-5Gplus(1) project. This platform takes advantage of new techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), network softwarization and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for closed-loop and end-to-end security management following a zero-touch model in 5G and Beyond 5G networks.

When people retire, companies can lose a lot of valuable know-how and experience. Experienced professionals enjoy a special status in companies because of their extensive and in-depth knowledge of work processes. Salaries and positions in companies are often linked to knowledge. The fear of losing status or even financial loss by sharing knowledge can be a reason for employees to keep their knowledge to themselves. The use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence in companies can also trigger several fears among employees like fears regarding job loss, new skill requirements or surveillance. An innovative work culture, where knowledge sharing is actively encouraged, required and rewarded, is not successfully implemented everywhere. A particular challenge in the KI_eeper project is to convince experienced employees in the participating organizations of the importance of sharing and preserving knowledge to ensure the company's long-term competitiveness. The aim is to encourage them to provide their knowledge to other employees with the help of an AI assistance system. In addition to the development of an assistance system, an important task of the project is the development of methods promoting knowledge transfer and contributing to the acceptance of the use of the new technology. Information and awareness-raising workshops with managers and employees have been designed and tested in the companies. Employees are involved in the development of the system in a participatory approach. This ensures that the system can be developed in a user- and needs-orientedmanner and thus the acceptance of the system's use in future everyday work can be promoted, which is crucial for long-term successful application.","[Rusch, Tobias; Ottersboeck, Nicole; Stowasser, Sascha] Inst Appl Ind Engn & Ergon, Uerdinger Str 56, D-40474 Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Rusch, T (corresponding author), Inst Appl Ind Engn & Ergon, Uerdinger Str 56, D-40474 Dusseldorf, Germany.",t.rusch@ifaa-mail.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [02L20C500- 02L20C505],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research and development project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the program Zukunft der Arbeit (funding codes 02L20C500- 02L20C505) and is supervised by the Project Management Agency Karlsruhe (PTKA).

Although all Schools had engaged with e-Learning in the past, detailed consideration of effective e-Learning and the e-experience of students had not been generally in evidence. We sought to address this gap in the strategic work of schools by implementing a change management program, the major elements of which were the development of a local evidence-base of effectiveness of e-Learning practices and conversations for change. Our program was based on the Appreciative Inquiry (AI) method, which we adapted for this educational context. The aim was to identify the pedagogic value of the diverse range of e-Learning activities already being undertaken and to encourage more widespread use. There was also a longer-term objective of assisting schools to establish or review their own e-Learning strategies and action plans. In terms of the effectiveness of the process, it is evident that the AI methodology was very beneficial. There is greater awareness among academic staff of the range of e-Learning activities that are currently being used in teaching designs of teaching staff at the University and about student use and attitudes to those activities. The evidence provides inputs to the development/review of e-Learning action plans and strategies for each school, usually within the context of the overall school plan.","[Murray, Linda A.; Alberts, Philip P.] Brunel Univ, LTDU, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Murray, LA (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, LTDU, LC016, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",linda.murray@brunel.ac.uk; phil.alberts@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-03581-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,205,214,,10.1007/978-3-642-03582-1_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03582-1_16,10.1007/978-3-642-03582-1,,10,Education & Educational Research,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BOZ08,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000278089600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

To enable AI research using an open -source, cloud -based, globally distributed, screening CT imaging data set and computational environment that are compliant with the most stringent international privacy regulations that also protect the intellectual properties of researchers, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer sponsored development of the Early Lung Imaging Confederation (ELIC) resource in 2018. The objective of this report is to describe the updated capabilities of ELIC and illustrate how this resource can be used for clinically relevant AI research. Methods: In this second phase of the initiative, metadata and screening CT scans from two time points were collected from 100 screening participants in seven countries. An automated deep learning AI lung segmentation algorithm, automated quantitative emphysema metrics, and a quantitative lung nodule volume measurement algorithm were run on these scans. Results: A total of 1394 CTs were collected from 697 participants. The LAV950 quantitative emphysema metric was found to be potentially useful in distinguishing lung cancer from benign cases using a combined slice thickness more than or equal to 2.5 mm. Lung nodule volume change measurements had better sensitivity and specificity for classifying malignant from benign lung nodules when applied to solid lung nodules from high -quality CT scans. Conclusions: These initial experiments revealed that ELIC can support deep learning AI and quantitative imaging analyses on diverse and globally distributed cloud -based data sets.

Over this period (in projects funded mostly by the UK Ministry of Defense and also US DOD) we have developed a technology which has delivered significant (and in fact in some cases remarkable) improvements over the group performance achieved by more traditional methods of integrating information applying it successfully to progressively more and more real-world applications. Our efforts have particularly focused on the area of decision making. Decisions (for example made by government, military or hospital management) are often made with limited amounts of information, or indeed too much information for any single person to take in, hence involving a high degree of uncertainty. Yet, such decisions can be highly critical in nature, with mistakes possibly resulting in extremely adverse outcomes, including loss of lives. So, any improvements in accuracy or speed of decisions in such conditions is vitally important. In the last 5 years we have also started to study hybrid human-AI decision-making groups by the inclusion of one or more AI-based teammates which act as peers to the humans. We found that when the conditions are right (more on this in the talk), human-AI groups produce super-human and super-AI performance. In this presentation, I will review BCIs and our approach, and will discuss some of the applications we explored including the identification of visual targets in cluttered environments, the comprehension of military radio communication, face recognition, military recognisance missions, military outposts and strategic resource allocation in a pandemic. I will finally look at potential future developments.","[Poli, Riccardo] Univ Essex, Brain Comp Interfaces & Neural Engn Lab, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Poli, R (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Brain Comp Interfaces & Neural Engn Lab, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester, Essex, England.",rpoli@essex.ac.uk,"Poli, Rinaldo/C-7483-2017","Poli, Riccardo/0000-0003-4612-0780",,,,,0,0,0,2,12,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0119-1,,,,2023,,,,,,,3,3,,10.1145/3583131.3603554,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3583131.3603554,,,1,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV4HS,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001031455100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Numerous site remediation technologies, generally classified as ex situ and in situ remediation techniques, have been developed and implemented to clean up the contaminated sites in the last two decades. One of the problems associated with ex situ remediation is the cost of operation. In recent years, in situ techniques have acquired popularity. However, the selection process of the desired techniques needs a large amount of knowledge. Insufficient expertise in the process may result in unnecessary inflation of expenses. In this study, petroleum waste management experts and Artificial Intelligence ( AI) researchers worked together to develop an expert system ( ES) for the management of petroleum contaminated sites. Various AI techniques were used to construct a useful tool for site remediation decision-making. This paper presents the knowledge engineering processes of knowledge acquisition, conceptual design, and system implementation in the project. The expert system was applied to a real-world case study and the results show that the expert system can generate desired remediation alternatives to assist decision-makers.

Donation-based crowdfunding (DBC) tasks are often listed on crowdfunding platforms to attract donors to donate for a specific reason in a stipulated time. As the frequency and intensity of disasters has increased over time, these platforms have gained in popularity, and they need a constant and consistent flow of funds to achieve their targets. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are often adopted by these channels to enhance their operational performance. We understand the process of adoption through uses and gratification theory, which is dominated by motivational factors, such as the utilitarian and symbolic benefits which DBC intends to achieve. The inflow of cash from multiple donors across the world, guided by AI tools, also gives rise to risks; therefore, we have used a moderating variable to better understand the operational performance of DBC. We collected empirical data through 293 responses from owners of DBC tasks in the context of disaster relief operations. We tested our hypotheses using partial least square structured equation modelling and controlled for intensity of disaster and crowdfunding task duration. Our results offer a significant extension to uses and gratification theory by understanding a positive relation between uses and gratification benefits and the adoption of AI tools for boosting operational performance. We project that, whereas the duration of a crowdfunding task plays an essential role in collecting the required funds for disaster relief operations, the intensity of the disaster does not impact the process of adopting AI tools or on their operational performance. Our study offers critical insights for understanding aspects of designing and implementing AI in DBC scenarios, which has been a grey area in understanding donors' behavior.","[Behl, Abhishek] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Global Business Sch, Sonipat, Haryana, India; [Dutta, Pankaj] Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Luo, Zongwei] BNU Zhuhai, BNU UIC Inst AI & Future Networks, BNU HKBU UIC, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Sheorey, Pratima] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ, Symbiosis Ctr Management & Human Resource Dev, Pune, Maharashtra, India",O.P.

This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword-based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword-based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development. Managerial Summary: Text-based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre-defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI-based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research.","[Miric, Milan] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Dept Data Sci & Operat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Jia, Nan] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Management & Org, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Huang, Kenneth G.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Innovat Entrepreneurship & Technol Managemen, Coll Design & Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Huang, Kenneth G.] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Jia, N (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Management & Org, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",nan.jia@marshall.usc.edu,"Jia, Nan/KHX-0851-2024; Miric, Milan/MAH-0817-2025; HUANG, Kenneth Guang-Lih/D-2205-2010","Miric, Milan/0000-0002-8318-9288; HUANG, Kenneth Guang-Lih/0000-0002-4811-5638",Institute for Outlier Research (iORB),Institute for Outlier Research (iORB),Institute for Outlier Research (iORB),,66,58,63,207,719,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-2095,1097-0266,,STRATEGIC MANAGE J,Strateg.

Simultaneously, project management has received more attention from academics and practitioners worldwide. Many studies have suggested that perceiving collaboration and risk are critical for successful construction project management. This study investigates the current status and future trends in building information modeling (BIM) literature from the Web of Science database. This review systematically uses bibliometric and systematic literature review (SLR) methods through co-occurrence and co-citation analysis. First, 650 academic documents were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Then, co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were performed along with network visualization to examine research interconnections' patterns. As a result, relevant keywords, productive authors, and important journals have been highlighted. The prominent research topics within the literature on building information modelling focus on the following topics: collaborative in BIM, integration of BIM, GIS and Internet of Things (IoT), barriers to the integration of BIM, sustainability and BIM, and risk assessment and uncertainty. Finally, the potential research directions are developing towards digital twin technology, integration of BIM and AI, and Augmented Reality (AR) and BIM. The presented findings of only 88 articles discuss the collaboration and risk issue in BIM for the construction industry and thus confirms the need for more studies on this topic to enhance the chances of successfully building information modelling projects. The review focuses only on the academic documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, thus restricting the coverage of the reviewed literature relating to building information modelling collaboration and risk.","[Ali, Kherun Nita; Kassem, Mukhtar A.] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Dept Quant Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Alhajlah, Hamed H.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; University of Birmingham,"Kassem, MA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Dept Quant Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",b-kherun@utm.my; hxa580@alumni.bham.ac.uk; mukhtarkas@gmail.com,"A.

However, the mechanism by which increased aridity drives ecosystems toward desertification and the impacts of aridity on desertification vulnerability both in space and over time remain unclear. Here, we collected eight key ecosystem structure/functioning data (including soil, vegetation, and animal) for threshold identification using piecewise linear models, and then linked them to biome shifts to explore the process of aridity-driven desertification. The results show that ecosystems along aridity index (AI, 1 - precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) gradients experience three vulnerable stages featuring different threshold and biome responses: a low vulnerability stage (AI: 0.5-0.65; mainly featuring a soil fertility loss and a forest decline), a moderate vulnerability stage (AI: 0.65-0.75; mainly featuring accelerated non-forest vegetation degradation) and a high vulnerability stage (AI: 0.75-1; mainly featuring rapid overall land degradation). According to further simulations, areas with low to high vulnerability account for 31% of the global terrestrial area, which is projected to increase by 18.8% (21.2%) by the end of the 21st century under the greenhouse gas emission scenario SSP2-4.5 (SSP3-7.0). Given increased vulnerability and population growth, Africa and East Asia are exposed to great desertification risk and ensuing contradiction between humans and land. These findings can provide a theoretical and practical reference for ecosystem management and policy development, which are critical for dryland ecological security and human welfare in areas threatened by desertification.","[Sun, Chuanlian; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie; Ma, Shijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanlian; Fu, Bojie; Ma, Shijun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Feng, XM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fengxm@rcees.ac.cn,"Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009; Feng, Xiaoming/C-6509-2018",,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; [41991233]; [2019QZKK0405],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; ;,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41991233) and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (2019QZKK0405).,,58,11,11,20,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Analysis of these publications was used to identify and make estimates for how resources allocated to ophthalmology in public health systems in Trinidad and Tobago can be more efficiently utilized by employing AI in diagnosing treatable DR. DR screening was found to be an effective method of detecting the disease. Screening was found to be a universally cost-effective method of disease prevention and for altering the natural history of the disease in the spectrum of lowmiddle to high -income economies, such as Rwanda, Thailand, China, South Korea, and Singapore. AI and deep learning systems were found to be clinically superior to, or as effective as, human graders in areas where they were deployed, indicating that the systems are clinically safe. They have been shown to improve access to diabetic retinal screening, improve compliance with screening appointments, and prove to be costeffective, especially in rural areas. Trinidad and Tobago, which is estimated to be disproportionately more affected by the burden of DR when projected out to the mid -21st century, stands to save as much as US$60 million annually from the implementation of an AI -based system to screen for DR versus conventional manual grading.","[Ramoutar, Ryan R.] Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Ophthalmol, Leicester, England",University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust; University of Leicester,"Ramoutar, RR (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Ophthalmol, Leicester, England.",ryan_ramoutar@hotmail.com,,"Ramoutar, Ryan Richard/0000-0001-7050-5379",,,,,42,0,0,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,MAR 7,2024,16,3,,,,,,,e55745,10.7759/cureus.55745,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.55745,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,NQ9S0,38586698,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:001202042700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods Collaborative Care was implemented in three AI/AN serving clinics. Clinic staff participated in training and coaching designed to facilitate practice change. We followed clinics for 2 years to observe improvements in depression treatment and to examine treatment outcomes for enrolled patients. Collaborative Care elements included universal screening for depression, evidence-based treatment to target, use of behavioral health care managers to deliver the intervention, use of psychiatric consultants to provide caseload consultation, and quality improvement tracking to improve and maintain outcomes. We used t-tests to evaluate the main effects of Collaborative Care and used multiple linear regression to better understand the predictors of success. We also collected qualitative data from members of the Collaborative Care clinical team about their experience. Results The clinics participated in training and practice coaching to implement Collaborative Care for depressed patients. Depression response (50% or greater reduction in depression symptoms as measured by the PHQ-9) and remission (PHQ-9 score less than 5) rates were equivalent in AI/AN patients as compared with White patients in the same clinics. Significant predictors of positive treatment outcome include only one depression treatment episodes during the study and more follow-up visits per patient. Clinicians were overall positive about their experience and the effect on patient care in their clinic. Conclusions This project showed that it is possible to deliver Collaborative Care to AI/AN patients via primary care settings in rural areas.","[Bowen, Deborah J.; Powers, Diane M.; Russo, Joan; Arao, Robert; LePoire, Erin; Ratzliff, Anna D.

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of 'explainable deep learning' as a subset of the 'explainable AI' problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts' knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.","[Thakker, Dhavalkumar; Mishra, Bhupesh Kumar; Abdullatif, Amr] Univ Bradford, Dept Comp Sci, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Mazumdar, Suvodeep] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Simpson, Sydney] City Bradford Metropolitan Dist Council, Bradford BD1 1HX, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford; University of Sheffield,"Thakker, D (corresponding author), Univ Bradford, Dept Comp Sci, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",d.thakker@bradford.ac.uk; b.mishra@bradford.ac.uk; a.r.a.abdullatif@bradford.ac.uk; s.mazumdar@sheffield.ac.uk; sydney.simpson@bradford.gov.uk,"Mishra, Bhupesh/ABD-5322-2020; ABDULLATIF, AMR/AAE-6521-2019; Thakker, Dhavalkumar/A-5743-2011","Mazumdar, Suvodeep/0000-0002-0748-7638; Thakker, Dhavalkumar/0000-0003-4479-3500; Mishra, Bhupesh/0000-0003-3430-8989; ABDULLATIF, AMR RASHAD AHMED/0000-0003-1801-4673",Interreg EC grant as part of Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE) project,Interreg EC grant as part of Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE) project,This research was funded by Interreg EC grant as part of Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE) project.,,129,30,31,3,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-6511,,SMART CITIES-BASEL,Smart Cities,DEC,2020,3,4,,,,,1353,1382,,10.3390/smartcities3040065,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/smartcities3040065,,,30,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Urban Studies",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Urban Studies,TX0OQ,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000682790900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

According to LC50 values, no significant differences were observed between spinosad (0.50 mg [AI]/kg diet) and methoxyfenozide (0.54 mg [AI]/kg diet) after 48 h of ingestion treatment on neonate larvae, based on the overlap of 95% CL. Similarly, on fourth instars, no significant differences were observed between LC50 (2.98 and 5.17 mg [AI] kg diet for spinosad and methoxyfenozide, respectively, at 96 h after ingestion of artificial diet) and LD50 (4.74 and 2.68 tig [AI]/g larva for spinosad and methoxyfenozide, respectively, at 144 h after topical application). In addition, spinosad and methoxyfenozide significantly suppressed weight gain of neonates and fourth instars continuously fed with artificial diet containing the insecticides. The second part of this project was focused on the effects of methoxyfenozide on the reproduction of S. littoralis by determining the effect on oviposition in three different crosses and the pharmacokinetics pattern of (C-14)-methoxyfenozide in the body tissues of female and male adults after topical application in their excrement and in the deposited eggs to test transport through the female and the male adult. Methoxyfenozide negatively affected the reproduction of adults regardless the treated sex, presumably because of its presence in the adult body, accumulation in the laid eggs, and slow excretion of the product.

Building on the success of England's National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, the national digital policy body (NHSX) sought to create a generalized national medical imaging platform for the development, validation, and deployment of algorithms. Objective: This study aims to understand international use cases of medical imaging platforms for the development and implementation of algorithms to inform the creation of England's national imaging platform. Methods: The National Health Service (NHS) AI Lab Policy and Strategy Team adopted a multiphased approach: (1) identification and prioritization of national AI imaging platforms; (2) Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental workshop on emerging themes and insights with the internal NHSX team; and (5) formulation of policy recommendations. Results: International use cases of national AI imaging platforms (n=7) were prioritized for PESTLE factor analysis. Stakeholders (n=13) from the international use cases were interviewed. Themes (n=8) from the semistructured interviews, including interview quotes, were analyzed with workshop participants (n=5). The outputs of the deep dives, interviews, and workshop were synthesized thematically into 8 categories with 17 subcategories. On the basis of the insights from the international use cases, policy recommendations (n=12) were developed to support the NHS AI Lab in the design and development of the English national medical imaging platform. Conclusions: The creation of AI algorithms supporting technology and infrastructure such as platforms often occurs in isolation within countries, let alone between countries. This novel policy research project sought to bridge the gap by learning from the challenges, successes, and experience of England's international counterparts. Policy recommendations based on international learnings focused on the demonstrable benefits of the platform to secure sustainable funding, validation of algorithms and infrastructure to support in situ deployment, and creating wraparound tools for nontechnical participants such as clinicians to engage with algorithm creation. As health care organizations increasingly adopt technological solutions, policy makers have a responsibility to ensure that initiatives are informed by learnings from both national and international initiatives as well as disseminating the outcomes of their work.","[Karpathakis, Kassandra] Decimal Hlth, 50 Milk St, Boston, MA 02109 USA; [Pencheon, Emma] UK Govt, Foreign Commonwealth & Dev Off, London, England; [Cushnan, Dominic] NHS England, London, England",,"Karpathakis, K (corresponding author), Decimal Hlth, 50 Milk St, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",kass.karpathakis@gmail.com,,"Karpathakis, Kassandra/0000-0003-3079-6268",Wellcome Trust doctoral scholarship,Wellcome Trust doctoral scholarship(Wellcome Trust),"First, the authors would like to thank the stakeholders from each initiative for participating in this research.

Modern techniques are essential to create new tools that outperform current cost estimation. This study introduced the Least Square Moment Balanced Machine (LSMBM), AI-based inference engine, to improve construction cost prediction accuracy. LSMBM considers moments to determine the optimal hyperplane and uses the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to assign weights to each data point. The effectiveness of LSMBM was tested by predicting the construction costs of residential and reinforced concrete buildings. Correlation analysis, PCA, and LASSO were used for feature selection to identify the most relevant variables, with the combination of LSMBM-PCA giving the best performance. When compared to other machine learning models, the LSMBM model achieved the lowest error values, with an RMSE of 0.016, MAE of 0.010, and MAPE of 4.569%. The overall performance measurement reference index (RI) further confirmed the superiority of LSMBM. Furthermore, LSMBM performed better than the Earned Value Management (EVM) method. LSMBM model has proven to enhanced the precision in predicting cost estimates, facilitating project managers to anticipate potential cost overruns and optimize resource allocation, provide information for strategic and operational decision-making processes in construction projects.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Khasani, Riqi Radian] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Cheng, MY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",myc@mail.ntust.edu.tw; riqi@live.undip.ac.id,"Cheng, Min-Yuan/G-3510-2013; KHASANI, RIQI RADIAN/HPC-6718-2023","KHASANI, RIQI RADIAN/0000-0002-7248-8602; Cheng, Min-Yuan/0000-0003-1312-4822",,,,,48,0,0,6,10,INT COUNCIL RESEARCH & INNOVATION BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION,ROTTERDAM,"KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS",1874-4753,,,J INF TECHNOL CONSTR,J.

We have produced substantial numbers of systems that function as products for commercial applications, and as advanced research tools specifically designed for experimental use. This paper reviews various aspects of the design and control of a number of robot-like machines ranging from our first projects, the Utah Arm and the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand, to present work on humanoid robots and the Wearable Energetically Autonomous Robot (WEAR). Our systems have been used in: entertainment, operator remotization from hazardous environments, R&D, and medicine. In addition to the robots and their subsystems, extensive work has been devoted to command systems that drive the robots. Command systems have been: play-back supervisors, teleoperation masters, and various higher level approaches based on work from the AI community. Playback interfaces have included motion-capture mechanisms that provide movement-stream information to storage systems configured for later, repeated and coordinated, operation of many robots and associated mechanisms. Play-back command systems use human commands, from an earlier time, to command motions that are played out, over and over, mindlessly. Teleoperation masters, that operate in real-time with the robot, have ranged from simple motion capture devices, to more complex force reflective exoskeletal masters. Teleoperation interfaces have been composed of complex kinematic structures designed to perform motions compatible with operator movements and are attached via appropriate soft tissue interfaces. The masters emit lower level commands (joint angles) in real-time using the natural intelligence and sensory systems of the operator. AI-based command sources, blend higher level (simple) commands, with system and existing environmental states, to make decisions for the management of the robot. As with the playback systems, AI-based systems are programmed earlier to perform later operations. In the AI case, however, adaptive intelligence and sensory capabilities reside in the robot. Our general design approach has been to begin with the definition of desired objective behaviors, rather than the use of available components with their predefined technical specifications. With the technical specifications of the components necessary to achieve the desired behaviors defined, the components are either acquired, or in most cases, developed and built. The control system, which includes the operation of feedback approaches, acting in collaboration with physical machinery, is then defined and implemented. Control is considered a function of both feedback, and the designed-in performance of the robot's physical machinery. It has not been true that bad performance from physical machine elements can be simply compensated out via innovative control methods and faster computers. After the completion of many projects we believe that the final frontier(s) of robotics reside at both ends of the brain and brawn spectrum. Both frontiers (barriers) are related to autonomy - intelligence/computation and energy/power. Recently, energetic autonomy has become a major interest at Sarcos and projects are underway to develop appropriate fuel-based servo-actuators to satisfy that need. Our objective is to develop power systems that are capable producing high performance servo-quality actuation for extended operating times without re-energizing the system. At the other end of the spectrum, we are working in collaboration with various groups to supply physical robots capable of operation under the control of advanced AI-based systems.","Sarcos Res Corp, SLC, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA",,"Jacobsen, SC (corresponding author), Sarcos Res Corp, SLC, 360 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA.",,,,,,,,5,5,6,1,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-7438,,3-540-00305-3,SPR TRA ADV ROBOT,,,2003,5,,,,,,2,20,,,,,,19,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics,BW37Z,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000181801300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

IPEs excel in providing immediate feedback for iterative development, testing, and debugging, making them ideal for fields like data science and AI. However, their typically linear and isolated interface struggles with managing the complexity of larger software projects. Conversely, traditional IDEs support extensive project management and debugging tools suited for complex applications but lack the interactive and incremental nature of IPEs. This paper reports on an ongoing investigation and design of a hybrid environment that combines benefits of IPEs and IDEs and the programming styles they naturally support. Central to our design is a graph structure representing code fragments as nodes and code structure as edges. By considering various types of nodes and relationships (e.g. for representing class membership, execution order, documentation, and dependencies) we can facilitate aspects of both incremental programming (in IPEs) and complexity management (in IDEs). We demonstrate our approach with a prototype, called Incremental Graph Code (IGC), by presenting its architecture and a showcase. We demonstrate IGC's functionality and discuss its potential advantages over existing environments. Key features include advanced code visualization, modular and incremental development, and complexity management. IGC aims to provide a unified, extensible, and flexible development environment that bridges the gap between different styles of programming.","[Boksem, Max; van Binsbergen, L.

Despite this potential, these datasets continue to be underused around the world. In this article, we combine a recently established global water resources reanalysis that was developed within the EartH2Observe research project, and in-situ data in the Magdalena Cauca Macrobasin in Colombia. Through rigorous hydrological modelling we evaluate the contribution of this new information to the derivation of water availability indices used to support water policy and management. Results confirm the complementarity of the reanalysis, with water management indices derived from the reanalysis data showing good comparison to values obtained using in-situ data only. Indeed, the estimation of simple indices such as an Aridity Index and a Water Regulation Index show to be a suitable method for assessing and comparing the different reanalysis datasets. We also explore the value of the reanalysis and earth observations datasets in the study of climate and land use change scenarios in the basin. While considering the associated uncertainties, results show that on average rainfall is projected to increase in the basin and thus available water resources. Deforestation will increase the water balance due to lower evapotranspiration. However, reduced fog deposition in deforested cloud forest areas will lead to a decrease in the water balance. The promising results of the comparison have bolstered the confidence of the national hydro-meteorological agency to include the evaluated reanalysis datasets in the national water resources evaluation, complementing available in-situ datasets.","[Rodriguez, Erasmo; Sanchez, Ines; Duque, Nicolas; Arboleda, Pedro; Vega, Carolina; Zamora, David; Garcia, Camila] Univ Nacl Colombia, Grp Invest Ingn Recursos Hidr GIREH, Bogota, Colombia; [Lopez, Patricia; Werner, Micha] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Lopez, Patricia] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kaune, Alexander; Werner, Micha] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Burke, Sophia] AmbioTEK CIC, Colchester, Essex, England",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Deltares; Utrecht University; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Rodriguez, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Grp Invest Ingn Recursos Hidr GIREH, Bogota, Colombia.",earodriguezs@unal.edu.co,"Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009","Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638; Zamora, David/0000-0002-2256-7054; Duque-Gardeazabal, Nicolas/0000-0002-2631-8573",,,,,59,22,22,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

However, there is a lack of applied research in industrial plants that would allow for the widespread deployment of this framework. Thus, the purpose of this article was to apply AI in an industrial application in order to develop application insights and identify the necessary prerequisites for achieving ZDM. A case study was done at a Swedish manufacturing plant to evaluate the implementation of a defect-detection strategy on products prone to misclassification and on an imbalanced data set with very few defects. A semi-supervised learning approach was used to learn which vibration properties differentiate confirmed defects from approved products. This method enabled the calculation of a defect similarity ratio that was used to predict how similar newly manufactured products are to defective products. This study identified four prerequisites and four insights critical for the development of an AI solution supporting ZDM. The key finding demonstrates how well traditional and innovative quality methods complement one another. The results highlight the importance of starting data science projects quickly to ensure data quality and allow a ZDM detection strategy to build knowledge to allow for the development of more proactive strategies, such as the prediction and prevention of defects.","[Leberruyer, Nicolas; Bruch, Jessica; Ahlskog, Mats] Malardalen Univ, Sch Innovat Design & Engn, Div Prod Realizat, Eskilstuna, Sweden; [Leberruyer, Nicolas; Afshar, Sara] Volvo Construct Equipment, Eskilstuna, Sweden",Malardalen University; Volvo,"Leberruyer, N (corresponding author), Malardalen Univ, Sch Innovat Design & Engn, Div Prod Realizat, Eskilstuna, Sweden.",nicolas.leberruyer@mdu.se; jessica.bruch@mdu.se; mats.ahlskog@mdu.se; sara.afshar@volvo.com,,"Leberruyer, Nicolas/0000-0002-4251-366X","Industrial Technology (IndTech) Graduate School; Vinnova (Stockholm, Sweden)","Industrial Technology (IndTech) Graduate School; Vinnova (Stockholm, Sweden)(Vinnova)","This work was partially supported by the Industrial Technology (IndTech) Graduate School founded by the Knowledge Foundation (KKS, Stockholm, Sweden) and the XPRES project funded by Vinnova (Stockholm, Sweden) .",,46,25,25,10,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-3615,1872-6194,,COMPUT IND,Comput.

However, the growing popularity of workflows has raised concerns about reproducibility and reusability which can hinder collaboration between institutions and users. In order to address these concerns, it is important to standardize workflows or provide tools that offer a framework for describing workflows and enabling computational reusability. One such set of standards that has recently emerged is the Common Workflow Language (CWL), which offers a robust and flexible framework for data analysis tools and workflows. To promote portability, reproducibility, and interoperability of AI/ML workflows, we developed geoweaver_cwl, a Python package that automatically describes AI/ML workflows from a workflow management system (WfMS) named Geoweaver into CWL. In this paper, we test our Python package on multiple use cases from different domains. Our objective is to demonstrate and verify the utility of this package. We make all the code and dataset open online and briefly describe the experimental implementation of the package in this paper, confirming that geoweaver_cwl can lead to a well-versed AI process while disclosing opportunities for further extensions.

This massive collection of data and samples will be used as a basis for real-world evidence studies, in-silico clinical trials, new clinical trials, and further classification of data through AI and ML techniques. The project also foresees a dedicated digital infrastructure consisting of standardized protocols, procedures, global informed consent and ethics support to ensure respect for ethics, and privacy and regulatory requirements, which would potentially help the creation of high-quality data for valuable research studies.Public Interest Summary Clinical research is extremely important for discovering new treatments for diseases but can be rather complex, especially considering the existence of multiple rules to follow. The project HUB Regionale Integrato Biobanca Analisi Dati e Utilizzo Sperimentale (HIBAD) aims to simplify some of the challenges of modern clinical research and to help researchers conducting clinical trials.

Additionally, they do not cover the problem area of acquisition and verifying complex domain knowledge. In the field of medicine there is a strong movement towards clinical protocols - resembling plans in AI - but computer support during execution of these plans (e.g., controlling, selection of alternatives) is still basic. We need to build complex plans, but also to reason about them in different ways in order to modify plans, to consider the effects of different plans over time, and to monitor execution.

In a time when the demand for electricity is escalating due to factors like taxes and urban expansion, it is imperative to explore strategies to cut costs. One pivotal area is public lighting management. Presently, governments are transitioning from sodium vapor lighting to LED lamps, which already contributes to decreasing consumption. In this scenario, computer vision systems, particularly using YOLO, have the potential to further reduce consumption by adjusting the power of LED lamps based on pedestrian traffic. Additionally, this paper employs fuzzy logic to calculate lamp power based on detected pedestrians and ambient lighting, ensuring compliance with the NBR 5101:2018 standard. Tests with public surveillance camera images and simulations validated the proposal. Upon implementing this project in practice, a 45% reduction in public lighting consumption was observed compared to conventional LED lighting.","[Vanin, Anderson Silva; Belan, Peterson] Nove Julho Univ, Informat & Knowledge Management Post Grad Program, BR-01525000 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Nove de Julho,"Belan, P (corresponding author), Nove Julho Univ, Informat & Knowledge Management Post Grad Program, BR-01525000 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",profandersonvanin@gmail.com; pbelan@gmail.com,,"Silva Vanin, Anderson/0000-0003-0241-3186",The authors would like to thank Nove de Julho University for financial support and the scholarship provided to Anderson Silva Vanin.; Nove de Julho University,The authors would like to thank Nove de Julho University for financial support and the scholarship provided to Anderson Silva Vanin.; Nove de Julho University,The authors would like to thank Nove de Julho University for financial support and the scholarship provided to Anderson Silva Vanin.,,26,1,1,5,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,SEP,2023,7,3,,,,,,,94,10.3390/urbansci7030094,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci7030094,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,T1QU9,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001075809100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the emphasized complexity, along with nonlinear behavior, high dimensionality, and stochasticity, frequently leads to analytic intractability. Simulation modeling does not possess this disadvantage allowing one to describe an inventory management system with all its details and take into account nonlinearity, uncertainty, and complexity. However, simulation modeling has several disadvantages, including technical complexity and the need for the back-and-forth information exchange between the domain experts and simulation engineers, which may significantly increase the project's duration and budget. Our study explores how the latest advancements in Natural Language Processing can be applied to assist in the development of a simulation model of the inventory management system. Our study mainly focuses on the proof of concept that state-of-the-art NLP systems are capable of understanding both the core principles behind the simulations of inventory management systems and the domain-specific context.

However, our understanding of how ecosystem service trade-offs (EST) respond to aridification re-mains limited. Here, generalized additive models and structural equation modeling were used to explore EST dynamics within an aridity gradient on the Loess Plateau, China. Trade-offs between water yield and both carbon storage and habitat quality showed nonlinear relationships with aridity, first increasing and then decreasing. Interestingly, climatic and human factors mostly indirectly influenced EST via effects on landscape characteristics. In regions with an Aridity Index (AI) value of <0.5, climatic and human factors strongly drove EST; in regions with AI > 0.5, landscape charac-teristics were most important. Therefore, landscape characteristics acted as the key regulators of EST. Importantly, AI values of similar to 0.5 represented a transition point, after which dramatic shifts in EST-driver relationships were observed. As >22 % of the Earth's terrestrial surface is projected to reach this level of aridity by 2100, further research on this boundary (between sub-humid and semi-arid areas) is urgently needed to protect ecosystems from the effects of in-creasing aridity. This study may serve as a valuable reference for mitigating the potential negative effects of increased aridity on human well-being.","[Hu, Baoan; Wu, Huifeng; Han, Hairong; Cheng, Xiaoqin; Kang, Fengfeng] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hu, Baoan; Wu, Huifeng; Han, Hairong; Cheng, Xiaoqin; Kang, Fengfeng] Qilaotu Mt Natl Observat & Res Stn Chinese Forest, Chifeng 024400, Peoples R China; [Han, Hairong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University,"Han, HR (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",hanhr6015@bjfu.edu.cn,"kang, fengfeng/LHA-4462-2024; Cheng, Xiaoqin/HSG-5512-2023","Hu, Baoan/0000-0003-0368-0921",National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China; [2019YFA0607304],National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China);,Acknowledgments This project was supported by the National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China (No. 2019YFA0607304) .,,70,28,29,28,207,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

We increase the proposed system's reliability by using third-generation partnership project standards to automate the distribution of transactional load among various connected units. This intelligent system encloses the hierarchy of automation enabled by artificial intelligence.

Data regarding patients' preference and choices will be stored and analysed also using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to measure and predict impact indicators regarding clinical outcomes (survival and toxicity), psychological indicators. Moreover, the same digital platform will contribute to a better organization of the activities. Discussion: Through the systematic acquisition of patient preferences and through integration with other clinical parameters, it will be possible to measure the clinical, psychological, organisational, and social impact of the newly implemented Art4ART project.

To enhance the perceived value of council participation by frontline nurses, administrators must promote the impact of council projects on healthcare outcomes. Purpose: The purposes of this appeal to action are to describe the role of nursing councils in promoting IS and EBP, and to provide recommendations that enhance the value of IS and/or EBP councils to frontline nurses, thereby incentivizing participation on these councils. Methods: Nurse researchers from three metropolitan hospitals partnered with a medical librarian to recommend six strategies aimed at enhancing the perceived value of council participation. An argumentative review was conducted to support these strategies. Discussion: Recommendations are inclusion of methods experts on councils; support from nursing administrators in the development, implementation, and evaluation of projects; formation of partnerships with nursing academic departments; expansion of publication opportunities and availability; and connection of projects to measurable quality indicators.

As the automation designed to support us grows more sophisticated and complex, our understanding of it tends to suffer. Recent research has addressed this issue in two ways: either through increased automation transparency or increased personalization. This paper overviews recent work in these two areas of strategic conformance (i.e., personalization) and automation transparency (e.g., explainable artificial intelligence and machine learning interpretability). We discuss how to achieve and how to balance conformance and transparency in the context of a machine learning system for conflict detection and resolution in air traffic control. In the MAHALO project, we aim to build, and empirically evaluate, a personalized and transparent decision support system by combining supervised and reinforcement learning approaches. We believe that such a system could strive for optimal performance while accommodating individual differences. By knowing the individual's preferences, the system would be able to afford transparency by explaining both why it suggests another solution (that deviates from the individual's), and why this solution is considered to be better.","[Westin, Carl] Linkoping Univ, Sci & Technol, Linkoping, Sweden; [Hilburn, Brian] Ctr Human Performance Res, The Hague, Netherlands; [Borst, Clark; Van Kampen, Erik-Jan] Delft Univ Technol, Control & Simulat, Delft, Netherlands; [Bang, Magnus] Linkoping Univ, Comp & Informat Sci, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Delft University of Technology; Linkoping University,"Westin, C (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Sci & Technol, Linkoping, Sweden.",carl.westin@liu.se; brian@chpr.nl; c.borst@tudelft.nl; e.vanKampen@tudelft.nl; magnus.bang@liu.se,,"van Kampen, Erik-Jan/0000-0002-5593-4471",SESAR Joint Undertaking (JU) [892970]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; SESAR JU,SESAR Joint Undertaking (JU); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020); SESAR JU,This project has received funding from the SESAR Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 892970.

Despite the significant number of modeling and simulation studies, there is still limited knowledge about the real nature of the chip formation process. Until today, better agreement with practical results is still being sought-after. Analyzing this situation, some scientists founded the industry 4.0 project to create new opportunities and benefits for industry. In manufacturing, this initiative requires data integration from CAD to CAM with associated Quality Management (QM), and leveraging advanced analytics such as artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) to solve complicated problems. In metal cutting, one such complicated problem is modeling of chip formation. Prior to leveraging AI, or rather to create the premise for a physics-based approach, the phenomena occurring during chip formation need better and more realistic modeling. This paper is presenting advances in physics-based modeling of chip formation with particularization for AlMg5. Adequate process mechanics will be developed resulting in modeling of chip-formation and simulation of chip flow. Moreover, it could be shown that the theoretically developed cutting result is in good agreement with the existing experimental result. There is only one disadvantage during production in the machining cell - the generated chip is very long and it is blocking the production process. Further investigation was necessary. A chip breaker was developed as a function of the existing production spectrum with individual geometry and kinematics.

Integrating recent technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and artificial intelligence with BCT creates the potential for overcoming many limitations within the construction industry. Blockchain smart contracts, for example, can solve problems related to traditional contract forms. In construction projects, smart contracts based on BCT can enhance payment transparency, protect transaction histories, and provide secure access to information. Since BCT platforms are decentralized, reducing unnecessary bureaucracy will improve open communications, and BCT application can prevent disputes rooted in communication issues, inaccurate documentation, and payment problems. This study focuses on reviewing BCT characteristics to evaluate impacts on mitigating disputes. Based on a systematic review of the publications, a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications in managing construction disputes is presented.

In case preventive actions are absent, a lack of quality results in a chain of problems. As a solution, this study deals with non-conformities proactively by adopting an AI-based predictive model approach. The main objective of this study is to provide an automated solution structured on the data recording system for the adverse impacts of construction quality failures. For this purpose, we collected 2527 non-conformance reports from 59 diverse construction projects to develop a predictive model regarding the cost impact of the quality problems. The first of three stages forming the backbone of the study determines crucial attributes linked to quality problems through a literature survey and the Delphi method. Secondly, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) were used to determine the attribute weights. In the final stage, we developed models to predict the cost impacts of non-conformities, using Case-based Reasoning (CBR). We made a comparison between the developed models to select the most precise one. The results show that the performance of CBR-GA using an automated weighting model is slightly better than CBR-AHP based on a subjective weighting system, whereas the case is the opposite in standard deviation in forecasting the cost outcome of the quality failures. Using both automated and expert systems, the study forecasts the cost impact of failures and reveals the factors linked to poor record-keeping. Ultimately, we concluded that the outcome of non-conformities can be predicted and prevented using past events via the developed AI-based predictive model.","[Dogan, Neset Berkay; Saygili, Murathan] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-068000 Ankara, Turkey; [Ayhan, Bilal Umut] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34060 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kazar, Gokhan] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34310 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ayozen, Yunus Emre] Minist Transport & Infrastruct Republ Turkey, Strategy Dev, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey; [Tokdemir, Onur Behzat] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Istanbul Bilgi University; Istanbul Gelisim University; Istanbul Technical University,"Tokdemir, OB (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey.",otokdemir@itu.edu.tr,"KAZAR, GOKHAN/LOR-1007-2024; Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/O-4718-2016; Ayhan, Bilal Umut/F-5350-2019","Kazar, Gokhan/0000-0002-8616-799X; Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/0000-0002-4101-8560; Saygili, Murathan/0000-0002-3090-2879; AYOZEN, Yunus Emre/0000-0002-9394-1568; Ayhan, Bilal Umut/0000-0002-1000-1678",,,,,76,8,8,4,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,NOV,2022,12,11,,,,,,,1946,10.3390/buildings12111946,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12111946,,,24,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,6G1FC,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000884504200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Standard data mining processes, such as CRISP-DM, have gained broad adoption over the past two decades. However, numerous studies demonstrated that organisations often do not apply CRISP-DM and related processes as-is, but rather adapt them to address industry-specific requirements. Accordingly, a number of sector-specific adaptations of standard data mining processes have been proposed. So far, however, no such adaptation has been suggested for the financial services sector. This paper addresses the gap by designing and evaluating a Financial Industry Process for Data Mining (FIN-DM). FIN-DM adapts and extends CRISP-DM to address regulatory compliance, governance, and risk management requirements inherent in the financial sector, and to embed quality assurance as an integral part of the data mining project life-cycle. The framework has been iteratively designed and validated with data mining and IT experts in a financial services organisation.","[Plotnikova, Veronika; Dumas, Marlon; Nolte, Alexander; Milani, Fredrik] Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Nolte, Alexander] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Plotnikova, Veronika] Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Narva mnt 18, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Tartu,"Plotnikova, V (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Narva mnt 18, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",veronika.plotnikova@ut.ee,"; Dumas, Marlon/H-2757-2015","Nolte, Alexander/0000-0003-1255-824X; Milani, Fredrik/0000-0002-1322-915X; Dumas, Marlon/0000-0002-9247-7476",European Regional Development Fund [EXCITE],European Regional Development Fund [EXCITE],This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund [EXCITE].,,80,1,1,4,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2573-234X,2573-2358,,J BUS ANAL,J.

Consequently, we implemented patient education on opioids and pain management aiming at decreasing opioid use without compromising pain management for acutely injured patients on the trauma service. Methods: Trauma patients admitted from August 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, and discharged to home were included. Pain management education started on February 2022. Demographics, injury severity scores (ISSs), preadmission opioid and adjunct use, and type/dose of opioids and nonopioid adjuncts prescribed 24 hours predischarge and at discharge were collected. Opioids were converted to oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Phone calls for pain and opioid prescription refills were collected. The preand posteducation groups were compared using univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with phone calls for pain and opioid refills. Results: Three hundred sixty-eight patients were included, 200 preand 168 posteducation. MME prescribed at discharge was positively associated with 24-hour predischarge MME (B = 0.010 [0.007-0.012], P < .001) and negatively associated with preinjury opioid use (B =-0.405 [-0.80 to-0.0 08], P = .045). Patient education led to an increased number of adjuncts prescribed (P < .008), decreased phone calls for pain (OR = 0.356 [0.165-0.770], P = .009), and decreased opioid refills (OR = 0.297 [0.131-0.675], P = .004), but no change in opioid prescriptions. Conclusion: Patient education on opioids and pain management led to decreased phone calls for inadequate pain management and decreased number of opioid refills. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

However, its adoption rate is still reported as low in the construction industry due to a lack of expertise and the limited reliable applications for AI technology. Hence, this paper aims to present the detailed outcome of experimentations evaluating the applicability and the performance of AI object detection algorithms for construction modular object detection. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a thorough evaluation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection, including the faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster RCNN) and single shot multi-box detector (SSD). Two types of metrics are also presented; first, the average recall and mean average precision by image pixels; second, the recall and precision by counting. To conduct the experiments using the selected algorithms, four infrastructure and building construction sites are chosen to collect the required data, including a total of 990 images of three different but common modular objects, including modular panels, safety barricades and site fences. Findings The results of the comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms show that the performance of faster RCNN and SSD depends on the context that detection occurs. Indeed, surrounding objects and the backgrounds of the objects affect the level of accuracy obtained from the AI analysis and may particularly effect precision and recall. The analysis of loss lines shows that the loss lines for selected objects depend on both their geometry and the image background. The results on selected objects show that faster RCNN offers higher accuracy than SSD for detection of selected objects. Research limitations/implications The results show that modular object detection is crucial in construction for the achievement of the required information for project quality and safety objectives. The detection process can significantly improve monitoring object installation progress in an accurate and machine-based manner avoiding human errors. The results of this paper are limited to three construction sites, but future investigations can cover more tasks or objects from different construction sites in a fully automated manner. Originality/value This paper's originality lies in offering new AI applications in modular construction, using a large first-hand data set collected from three construction sites. Furthermore, the paper presents the scientific evaluation results of implementing recent object detection algorithms across a set of extended metrics using the original training and validation data sets to improve the generalisability of the experimentation. This paper also provides the practitioners and scholars with a workflow on AI applications in the modular context and the first-hand referencing data.","[Liu, Chang; Mohammadi, Gelareh] Univ New South Wales, Fac Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [M.E.

Blockchain technology, with its unique blend of anonymity and data transparency, has facilitated the development of decentralized identities (DIDs) on the internet. These DIDs serve as digital representatives for individuals online, enhancing user trust through self-sovereign identity, transparency, and user control, while strengthening privacy. Current DID solutions, such as Proof-of-Personhood and Proof-of-Reputation, have demonstrated technological maturity and paved the way for identity applications in Web3. Building on this foundation, the Twin3 project advances the concept further by introducing the innovative Proof-of-Authenticity (PoA) to represent pluralistic human characteristics in digital format. Specifically, Twin3 employs blockchain-based Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to transform human identities into a programmable hexadecimal matrix with 256 characteristic spaces, representing a comprehensive spectrum of human attributes, akin to a digital DNA (Decentralized Nexus of Authenticity). This study presents the Twin3 system architecture, user data management,demonstrating how this approach can enhance personal digital identity verification and management. The potential applications of Twin3 SBTs in creating personal AI agents and facilitating participation in the agentic economy are explored, demonstrating how Twin3 can digitize human attributes comprehensively and empower individuals within emerging agent-based workflows and digital ecosystems.","[Wen, Ming Hui] Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept Commercial Design & Management, Taipei 10051, Taiwan; [Chun-Wei Lin, Jerry] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Automat Control Elect & Comp Sci, Dept Distributed Syst & IT Devices, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",National Taipei University of Business; Silesian University of Technology,"Wen, MH (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept Commercial Design & Management, Taipei 10051, Taiwan.",donwen@ntub.edu.tw,,,,,,,38,0,0,5,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,178997,179009,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3486033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3486033,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,O8U0Y,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001373800700036,View Full Record in Web of Science

A pivot to these radio technologies is the effective management of large-scale antenna arrays, which aims to construct valid spatial streams to maximize system throughput. Traditional management methods predominantly rely on user feedback to adapt to dynamic wireless channels. However, a more promising approach lies in the prediction of spatial channel state information (spatial-CSI), which is a channel characterization that consists of all robust line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), with three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. Recent advances in hardware and neural networks make it possible to predict such spatial-CSI using precise environmental information, and further explores the possibility of holographic communication, which implies complete control over every aspect of the radio waves. This paper presents a preliminary exploration of using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately model the environment particularly for radio simulations and identify valid paths within it for real-time spatial-CSI prediction. Our validation project demonstrates promising results, highlighting the potential of this approach in driving forward the evolution of 6G wireless communication technologies.","[Zhang, Lihao; Sun, Haijian] Univ Georgia, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Zeng, Yong] Southeast Univ, Natl Mobile Commun Res Lab, Nanjing 210018, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yong] Purple Mt Labs, Nanjing 211111, Peoples R China; [Hu, Rose Qingyang] Utah State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Southeast University - China; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Sun, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",lihao.zhang@uga.edu; hsun@uga.edu; yongzeng@seu.edu; rose.hu@usu.edu,"ZHANG, Lihao/JQV-3380-2023; Hu, Rose/P-8926-2018","Hu, Rose/0000-0002-1571-3631; Sun, Haijian/0000-0002-0680-147X","NSF [2236449, 1941524, 2007995, 2139508, 2319487]; UGA E-Mobility Initiative Grant",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UGA E-Mobility Initiative Grant,"The work of Haijian Sun was supported in part by NSF under Grant 2236449 and in part by the UGA E-Mobility Initiative Grant.

However, existing solutions are neither efficient nor scalable when projecting enormous objects due to their reliance on expensive specialized equipment. To fill this gap, we propose PolyVerse, an edge computing-powered metaverse platform that supports practical Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) projection while preserving low costs. PolyVerse tackles two challenges in P2V. First, P2V inherently requires real-time projection of enormous physical objects, which is difficult to achieve without specialized equipment. To overcome this issue, we alternatively utilize edge computing-based methods to collect, process, and analyze large-scale physical-world data with costeffective edge devices and AI models. Workloads are adaptively scheduled among edge devices through a heuristic algorithm to reduce latency. Second, metaverse users may encounter inconsistent states among multiple metaverse service providers, which can be caused by potential networking issues or malicious state tampering when projecting vast objects. To this end, we develop a blockchain-based metaverse management scheme among service providers to ensure a consistent view for users. States are initially constructed as a Metaverse State Tree that supports efficient accumulation, retrieval, and membership proof generation. The tree digests are further secured by blockchain consensus to ensure consistency. Finally, we develop a metaverse campus prototype where real-world pedestrians are projected into the virtual world in real-time. Evaluation shows that PolyVerse can project objects within an average latency of 250ms.","[Cao, Yinfeng; Cao, Jiannong; Bai, Dongbin; Hu, Zhiyuan; Wang, Kaile; Zhang, Mingjin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zhang, MJ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Mingjin/ITT-3171-2023; CAO, Yinfeng/LMM-9998-2024; Hu, Zhiyuan/JPX-7229-2023","CAO, Yinfeng/0000-0003-1048-3299","Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of Things, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HK RGC Collaborative Research Fund (CRF) [C2004-21GF]; Innovation and Technology Fund - Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (ITF-MHKJFS) [MHP/013/21]","Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of Things, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HK RGC Collaborative Research Fund (CRF); Innovation and Technology Fund - Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (ITF-MHKJFS)","This work was supported by the Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of Things, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HK RGC Collaborative Research Fund (CRF) No. C2004-21GF, and Innovation and Technology Fund - Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (ITF-MHKJFS) No. MHP/013/21.",,25,8,8,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,979-8-3503-2845-5,,,,2023,,,,,,,78,85,,10.1109/iMETA59369.2023.10294558,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iMETA59369.2023.10294558,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematics,BW3UA,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001143688600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the implementation of a series of afforestation/reforestation projects in the western China, the optimization and management of forest landscape patterns will become more important for soil conservation. In this study, the Bailongjiang Watershed (BLJW), in the western China, was used as a case study to explore the relationship between the forest landscape pattern and soil conservation services using mathematical and spatial statistics methods. A spatially-explicit model called the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) model of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) was used to assess the soil conservation service in each sub-basin of BLJW in 1990, 2002, and 2014, and landscape indices were used to describe changes in forest landscape patterns in each sub-basin. Nine forest landscape indices, including the percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), landscape shape index (LSI), mean patch shape (SHAPE_MN), patch cohesion index (COHESION), landscape division index (DIVISION), splitting index (SPLIT) and aggregation index (AI), were significantly correlated to the soil conservation service. PLAND, AI, LSI and SPLIT of forestland were determined to be the more important landscape indicators. The results also indicated that soil conservation was substantially scale-dependent. The results demonstrated that landscape type diversity greatly affected watershed soil conservation and can be used for forest landscape restoration and management. Furthermore, spatial statistics analysis indicated that the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) was superior to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for soil conservation regressions in 1990 and 2014, while OLS was more appropriate for the regression in 2002. These findings will be useful for enhancing soil conservation and for optimizing mountainous forest landscape patterns for afforestation/reforestation and regional development. Future planning and implementation of ecological restoration should focus more on strategic spatial planning and integrated landscape management with full consideration of future climate, water availability/consumption, hydrological regime, topography, and watershed features, especially on afforestation and revegetation projects in western mountainous China, where the socio-ecological system is fragile and poor.","[Gong Jie; Zhang Jinxi; Zhang Yunxia; Zhu Yuehua; Jin Tiantian; Xu Caixian] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhang Jinxi] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Beijing Normal University,"Gong, J (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",jgong@lzu.edu.cn,"Gong, Jie/KMX-8624-2024",,,,,,98,15,17,11,96,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

Unfortunately, most of them are threatened or endangered because of over-hunting, poaching or habitat destruction. Protection of wild populations (in situ) and management of animal collections in zoos and breeding centres (ex situ) are complementary conservation efforts relying on multidisciplinary approaches. Reproductive biology of deer species is one of the critical areas that still needs to be thoroughly studied to ensure the success ofin situorex situprograms. Interestingly, there is a vast diversity in reproductive traits within the deer family (from anatomy to breeding-season patterns). On the basis of this fundamental knowledge, adapted reproductive biotechnologies have been developed to enhance reproduction and preserve fertility of individuals. Early works on artificial insemination (AI),in vitrofertilisation (IVF), and germplasm freezing in the more common red deer, sika deer and white-tailed deer have been highly inspiring to projects aiming at saving endangered deer species. A few fawn births following AI or IVF using frozen semen have been reported in wild species (e.g. Eld's deer,Rucervus eldii thamin); however, assisted reproductive techniques and cryo-banking are currently not integrated into the management of rare and endangered populations. Knowing that many deer populations are rapidly decliningin situandex situ, there is now an urgent need for better strategies and more fertility preservation options. The objectives of the present article are to review (1) existing reproductive biotechnologies to preserve fertility of different deer species and (2) how to integrate these approaches into the management of rare and endangered populations to address conservation issues.","[Comizzoli, P.] Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Washington, DC 20008 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute,"Comizzoli, P (corresponding author), Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",comizzolip@si.edu,,,,,,,30,3,3,1,20,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1836-0939,1836-5787,,ANIM PROD SCI,Anim.

The objective was to determine the minimum and maximum numbers of beds required in real-time, according to the 3P-U model. Results A total of 105,457 patients were included. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the 3P-U was 0.82 for all of the patients and 0.90 for the unambiguous cases. Specifically, 38,353 (36.4%) patients were flagged as likely to be discharged, 18,815 (17.8%) were flagged as likely to be admitted, and 48,297 (45.8%) patients could not be flagged. Based on the predicted minimum number of beds (for unambiguous cases only) and the maximum number of beds (all patients), the hospital management coordinated the conversion of wards into dedicated COVID-19 units. Discussion and conclusions: The 3P-U model's AUROC is in the middle of range reported in the literature for similar classifiers. By considering the range of required bed numbers, the waste of resources (e.g., time and beds) could be reduced. The study concludes that the application of AI could help considerably improve the management of hospital resources during global pandemics, such as COVID-19.","[Arnaud, Emilien; Ammirati, Christine] Amiens Picardy Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, F-80000 Amiens, France; [Arnaud, Emilien; Elbattah, Mahmoud; Dequen, Gilles; Ghazali, Daniel Aiham] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Lab Modelisat Informat Syst MIS, F-80080 Amiens, France; [Elbattah, Mahmoud] Univ West England, Fac Environm & Technol, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Ammirati, Christine] Amiens Picardy Univ Hosp, SimuSante, F-80000 Amiens, France; [Ghazali, Daniel Aiham] Univ Paris Diderot, INSERM UMR1137, Infect Antimicrobials Modelling Evolut, F-75018 Paris, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); University of West England; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite,"Ghazali, DA (corresponding author), Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Lab Modelisat Informat Syst MIS, F-80080 Amiens, France.;Ghazali, DA (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, INSERM UMR1137, Infect Antimicrobials Modelling Evolut, F-75018 Paris, France.",ghazali.danielaiham@chu-amiens.fr,"GHAZALI, Daniel/ABC-7430-2021; ARNAUD, Émilien/HJI-5325-2023","GHAZALI, Daniel Aiham/0000-0003-0129-4322; ARNAUD, Emilien/0000-0002-6971-009X; Dequen, Gilles/0000-0001-7497-1182",,,,,27,8,8,3,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The basic hypothesis of our research is that artificial intelligence (AI)-based IT applications have an increasingly important role in the field of smart cities in terms of issues related to waste management. In our present article, we set out to analyze the characteristics of chatbot applications dedicated to waste recycling in the case of smart cities and propose some innovative ideas to improve the efficiency of such applications. Based on the consultation and analysis of a whole series of chatbot-type applications used to facilitate the recycling activity, we systematically analyze and evaluate five illustrative examples of chatbots employed in the context of material recycling. We provide performance comparisons in a table based on specific relevant criteria. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of these chatbots has led to the idea of improving the performance of this type of application. In this sense, we propose a series of innovative concepts that can be successfully implemented in future chatbots dedicated to the field of the circular economy. Here, we detail the innovative ideas that can promote the circular economy and capitalize on the potential of chatbots in the waste recycling activity. We also identify some possible limitations of these new ideas that we propose to be implemented. As for future research directions, our goal is to develop a chatbot dedicated to improving waste recycling practices within the framework of a smart city. Such innovation holds promise in improving sustainability efforts and fostering environmental stewardship within urban environments.","[Zota, Razvan Daniel; Cimpeanu, Ionut Alexandru; Dragomir, Denis Alexandru; Lungu, Mihai Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Zota, RD (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",zota@ase.ro; ionut.cimpeanu@csie.ase.ro; dragomirdenis15@stud.ase.ro; adrian.lungu@csie.ase.ro,"Cimpeanu, Ionut/HKO-9083-2023; Dragomir, Denis-Alexandru/JFS-3824-2023; Zota, Razvan Daniel/AAH-2479-2019","Zota, Razvan Daniel/0000-0001-9324-7798; Lungu, Mihai Adrian/0009-0005-4808-640X; Cimpeanu, Ionut-Alexandru/0000-0001-6533-9695",,,,,54,3,3,6,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Grounded in the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework, the Resource-Based View (RBV) and the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), this study investigates the relationship between the adoption of digital technologies and the competitive edge (CE) of heavy-engineering firms. Specifically, this research seeks to assess how the adoption of DTs impacts four critical competitive-edge metrics: efficient resource management (CE1), real-time monitoring and control (CE2), data-driven decision-making (CE3) and improved collaboration and communication (CE4). A quantitative research approach was employed, using a structured questionnaire distributed to construction professionals in Lagos State, Nigeria. The principal results of the study revealed that firms adopting artificial intelligence (AI), cloud-based technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) exhibited significantly higher competitive-edge metrics compared to their counterparts. Notably, AI and cloud-based technology were found to have a particularly strong association with improved resource management, real-time monitoring, and decision-making processes. A major contribution of this research is the development of a DT-adoption model which can serve as a benchmarking tool for firms to assess their current adoption levels and identify areas for improvement. This model can also guide policymakers and regulators in developing strategies to encourage the integration of digital technologies within the heavy-construction industry. The originality of this study lies in its holistic approach, examining a broad spectrum of digital technologies and their collective impact on enhancing the competitive edge of construction firms.","[Aliu, John] Univ Georgia, Engn Educ Transformat Inst, Coll Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel; Jesudaju, Oluwatayo Timothy] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Quant Surveying, Res Grp Sustainable Infrastruct Management Plus RG, Akure 340252, Nigeria; [Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, CIDB Ctr Excellence, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Akanni, Prince O.] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Bldg, Akure 340252, Nigeria; [Ehbohimen, Tolulope] Ardova Plc, Dept Asset Management & Capital Project, Lagos 102361, Nigeria; [Dosumu, Oluwaseun Sunday] Univ Rwanda, Dept Construct Econ & Management, Kigali POB 3600, Kigali, Rwanda",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Johannesburg; University of Rwanda,"Aliu, J (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Engn Educ Transformat Inst, Coll Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",john.aliu@uga.edu; emayok@gmail.com; jesudajut@gmail.com; shettyma64@yahoo.co.uk; ehijeltolulope38@gmail.com; o.dosumu@ur.ac.rw,"; Oke, Ayodeji/C-1218-2013; Dosumu, Oluwaseun/ABN-2133-2022","Ogbeleakhu Aliu, John/0000-0001-5651-4009; Oke, Ayodeji/0000-0001-6551-8634; Dosumu, Oluwaseun/0000-0002-9730-3598",,,,,40,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,FEB,2025,15,3,,,,,,,380,10.3390/buildings15030380,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings15030380,,,25,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,W5U3S,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001419219000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, very limited studies have reviewed the trends of such technologies in the context of flash floods. This study reviews innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and robotics used for flash flood early warnings and susceptibility predictions. Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were manually collected from scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Based on the review, AI/ML has been applied to flash flood susceptibility and early warning prediction in 64% of the published papers, followed by the IoT (19%), cloud computing (6%), and robotics (2%). Among the most common AI/ML methods used in susceptibility and early warning predictions are random forests and support vector machines. However, further optimization and emerging technologies, such as computer vision, are required to improve these technologies. AI/ML algorithms have demonstrated very accurate prediction performance, with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.90. However, there is a need to improve on these current models with large test datasets. Through AI/ML, IoT, and cloud computing technologies, early warnings can be disseminated to targeted communities in real time via electronic media, such as SMS and social media platforms. In spite of this, these systems have issues with internet connectivity, as well as data loss. Additionally, Al/ML used a number of topographical variables (such as slope), geological variables (such as lithology), and hydrological variables (such as stream density) to predict susceptibility, but the selection of these variables lacks a clear theoretical basis and has inconsistencies. To generate more reliable flood risk assessment maps, future studies should also consider sociodemographic, health, and housing data. Considering future climate change impacts, susceptibility or early warning studies may be projected under different climate change scenarios to help design long-term adaptation strategies.","[Al-Rawas, Ghazi; Nikoo, Mohammad Reza; Etri, Talal] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Muscat 123, Oman; [Al-Wardy, Malik] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Ctr Environm Studies & Res, Muscat 123, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University; Sultan Qaboos University,"Al-Rawas, G (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Muscat 123, Oman.",ghazi@squ.edu.om; m.reza@squ.edu.om; mwardy@squ.edu.om; t.etri1@squ.edu.om,"Al-Rawas, Ghazi/HJG-7729-2022; Nikoo, Mohammad/AAL-4218-2020; Etri, Talal/JAO-5118-2023; Al-Wardy, Malik/AAG-8048-2019","Nikoo, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-3740-4389; Etri, Talal/0000-0002-0459-4948; Al-Wardy, Malik/0000-0002-9105-2804",Sultan Qaboos University (SQU); Diwan of Royal Court [SR/DVC/CESR/22/01],Sultan Qaboos University (SQU)(Sultan Qaboos University); Diwan of Royal Court,The authors thank Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and Diwan of Royal Court for the financial support under His Majesty (HM) grant number SR/DVC/CESR/22/01.,,94,2,2,22,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2024,16,14,,,,,,,2069,10.3390/w16142069,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16142069,,,28,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZS9M0,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001277398000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, systemic, soil-applied neonicotinoid insecticides are translocated to pollen and nectar of flowers, often for months, and may reduce survival of flower-feeding beneficial insects. Imidacloprid seed-treated crops (0.05 mg AI (active ingredient)/canola seed and 1.2 mg AI/corn seed) translocate less than 10 ppb to pollen and nectar. However, higher rates of soil-applied imidacloprid are used in nurseries and urban landscapes, such as 300 mg AI/10 L (3 gallon) pot and 69 g AI applied to the soil under a 61 (24 in) cm diam. tree. Translocation of imidacloprid from soil (300 mg AI) to flowers of Asclepias curassavica resulted in 6,030 ppb in 1X and 10,400 ppb in 2X treatments, which are similar to imidacloprid residues found in another plant species we studied. A second imidacloprid soil application 7 months later resulted in 21,000 ppb in 1X and 45,000 ppb in 2X treatments. Consequently, greenhouse/nursery use of imidacloprid applied to flowering plants can result in 793 to 1,368 times higher concentration compared to an imidacloprid seed treatment (7.6 ppb pollen in seed-treated canola), where most research has focused. These higher imidacloprid levels caused significant mortality in both 1X and 2X treatments in 3 lady beetle species, Coleomegilla maculata, Harmonia axyridis, and Hippodamia convergens, but not a fourth species, Coccinella septempunctata. Adult survival were not reduced for monarch, Danaus plexippus and painted lady, Vanessa cardui, butterflies, but larval survival was significantly reduced. The use of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at greenhouse/nursery rates reduced survival of beneficial insects feeding on pollen and nectar and is incompatible with the principles of IPM.","[Krischik, Vera; Varshney, Aruna] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55455 USA; [Rogers, Mary] Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, St Paul, MN USA; [Gupta, Garima] Panjab Univ, Dept Zool, Chandigarh 160014, India",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Panjab University,"Krischik, V (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55455 USA.",krisc001@umn.edu,"Gupta, Garima/AAC-5424-2021","Gupta, Garima/0000-0003-1088-4957; Rogers, Mary/0000-0001-6609-3113",USDA SARE [00015590]; grant Mitigating pollinator decline [2010 MN LCCMR 221G]; University of Minnesota Experiment Station (MAES) project [MN 17-027]; Minnesota Nursery and Landscape Association,USDA SARE(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); grant Mitigating pollinator decline; University of Minnesota Experiment Station (MAES) project; Minnesota Nursery and Landscape Association,"Research was supported by a USDA SARE (00015590) grant The role of imidacloprid systemic insecticide on colony collapse disorder of honey bees and decline of bumblebee pollinators, 2010 MN LCCMR 221G grant Mitigating pollinator decline, and University of Minnesota Experiment Station (MAES) project MN 17-027 and a small grant from the Minnesota Nursery and Landscape Association in 2007.

Its aim is to attract and engage target audiences through various strategies and methods, driving brand promotion and sales growth. The primary objective of this scholarly study is to seamlessly integrate advanced big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology into the realm of digital marketing, thereby fostering the progression and optimization of sustainable digital marketing practices. First, the characteristics and applications of big data involving vast, diverse, and complex datasets are analyzed. Understanding their attributes and scope of application is essential. Subsequently, a comprehensive investigation into AI-driven learning mechanisms is conducted, culminating in the development of an AI random forest model (RFM) tailored for sustainable digital marketing. Subsequent to this, leveraging a real-world case study involving enterprise X, fundamental customer data is collected and subjected to meticulous analysis. The RFM model, ingeniously crafted in this study, is then deployed to prognosticate the anticipated count of prospective customers for said enterprise. The empirical findings spotlight a pronounced prevalence of university-affiliated individuals across diverse age cohorts. In terms of occupational distribution within the customer base, the categories of workers and educators emerge as dominant, constituting 41% and 31% of the demographic, respectively. Furthermore, the price distribution of patrons exhibits a skewed pattern, whereby the price bracket of 0-150 encompasses 17% of the population, whereas the range of 150-300 captures a notable 52%. These delineated price bands collectively constitute a substantial proportion, whereas the range exceeding 450 embodies a minority, accounting for less than 20%. Notably, the RFM model devised in this scholarly endeavor demonstrates a remarkable proficiency in accurately projecting forthcoming passenger volumes over a seven-day horizon, significantly surpassing the predictive capability of logistic regression. Evidently, the AI-driven RFM model proffered herein excels in the precise anticipation of target customer counts, thereby furnishing a pragmatic foundation for the intelligent evolution of sustainable digital marketing strategies.","[Jin, Keyan] Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Ceuta 51001, Spain; [Zhong, Zoe Ziqi] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Zhao, Elena Yifei] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Granada; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Southern California,"Zhong, ZZ (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England.",kjin@correo.ugr.es; z.zhong6@lse.ac.uk; zhaoyife@usc.edu,"Jin, Keyan/KUF-3613-2024; Zhong, Ziqi/KGK-9958-2024","Zhong, Ziqi/0000-0002-3919-9999",China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),No Statement Available,,64,5,5,50,95,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Most of these activities are of a constantly changing nature and their specific hazards are not very well known until much later into the construction process. Though the fundamental processes involved in construction remain the same, every construction project is unique & has its own specific jobs & hazards associated with them depending on the design specifications, materials, equipment & processes used & the safety culture followed by the working agency. Construction workers are especially vulnerable to injuries due to fall from height, electrocution, being caught in or between objects, being struck by moving machinery, falling objects, vehicles, etc. which can also lead to fatal incidents. Apart from these, they are also susceptible to irreversible health issues arising out of exposure to dust & other harmful substances. Project execution & construction activities have been one of the most challenging activities in Tata Steel because of a large diversity in geographical locations, types of operations & various process requirements. The organization has undertaken many greenfield as well as brownfield projects which both have different kinds of risks involved. Since the last few years, Tata Steel has taken many initiatives to mitigate the hazards & reduce the incidents in construction activities. One of the major steps taken in this direction was the implementation of Prevention through Design (PtD) in projects. This included adoption of practices like virtual design & construction, use of bolted & prefabricated structures, laser scanning & 3D modeling, powered access system, e-work permit, site access control and AI-based CCTV surveillance for monitoring of site activities among many others. Prevention through design is a transdisciplinary process which aims at reducing the hazards in the design & planning phase itself, making the construction activities inherently safer and their safety management cheaper. Risk identification & prioritization is done for each job according to a risk heat map based on the potential consequences of each hazardous event & its likelihood of occurrence. The top risks are identified & design interventions are proposed to eliminate or substitute them. Prevention through design, powered by automation & digitized safety management systems, is widely gaining use in several operations as well as construction projects due to its advantages and ease of implementation. The adoption of these safety technologies & automation has helped in proactively mitigating risks & significantly increased the effectiveness of health & safety management systems at construction sites. The construction companies should adopt these safety practices & policies, that combined with the implementation of digital health & safety tools & techniques could assist site managers ensure efficiency of their construction projects.

Many organizations today are establishing financial inclusion goals to promote social impact and have been increasing their investments in this space. Financial inclusion is the opportunity for individuals and businesses to have access to affordable financial products including loans, credit, and insurance that they may otherwise not have access to with traditional financial institutions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending serves as a platform that can support and foster financial inclusion and influence social impact and is becoming more popular today as a resource to underserved communities. Loans issued through P2P lending can fund projects and initiatives focused on climate change, workforce diversity, women's rights, equity, labor practices, natural resource management, accounting standards, carbon emissions, and several other areas. With this in mind, AI can be a powerful governance tool to help manage risks and promote opportunities for an organization's financial inclusion goals. In this paper, we explore how AI, specifically machine learning, can help manage the P2P platform Kiva's investment risks and deliver impact, emphasizing the importance of prediction model retraining to account for regulatory and other changes across the P2P landscape to drive better decision-making. As part of this research, we also explore how changes in important model variables affect aggregate model predictions.","[Austin, Tasha] Capitol Technol Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Rawal, Bharat S.] Grambling State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Grambling, LA 71245 USA",Capitol Technology University; University of Louisiana System; Grambling State University,"Rawal, BS (corresponding author), Grambling State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Grambling, LA 71245 USA.",liaustin@captechu.edu; brawal@ieee.org,,,,,,,33,2,2,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4893,,ALGORITHMS,Algorithms,AUG,2023,16,8,,,,,,,363,10.3390/a16080363,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a16080363,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,Q2VF0,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001056135700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study presents the impact of climate forecasts on GR within a probabilistic framework in a site-specific study in the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), the largest stabilized sand dune region in the USA containing the greatest recharge rates within the High Plains Aquifer. A total of 19 downscaled climate projections were used to evaluate the impact of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration on GR rates simulated by using HYDRUS 1-D. The analysis of the decadal aridity index (AI) indicates that climate class will likely remain similar to the historic average in the RCP2.6, 4.5, and 6.0 emission scenarios but AI will likely decrease significantly under the worst-case emission scenario (RCP8.5). However, GR rates will likely decrease in all of the four emission scenarios. The results show that GR generally decreases by similar to 25% under the business-as-usual scenario and by nearly 50% in the worst-case scenario. Moreover, the most likely GR values are presented with respect to probabilities in AI and the relationship between annual-average precipitation and GR rate were developed in both historic and projected scenarios. Finally, to present results at sub-annual time resolution, three representative climate projections (dry, mean and wet scenarios) were selected from the statistical distribution of cumulative GR. In the dry scenario, the excessive evapotranspiration demand in the spring and precipitation deficit in the summer can cause the occurrence of wilting points and plant withering due to excessive root-water-stress. This may pose significant threats to the survival of the native grassland ecology in the NSH and potentially lead to desertification processes if climate change is not properly addressed.","[Adane, Zablon; Zlotnik, Vitaly A.; Rossman, Nathan R.; Nasta, Paolo] Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Adane, Zablon] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Rossman, Nathan R.] HDR, Omaha, NE 68106 USA; [Wang, Tiejun] Tianjin Univ, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Nasta, Paolo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Agr, Div Agr Forest & Biosyst Engn, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Tianjin University; University of Naples Federico II,"Nasta, P (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.;Nasta, P (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Agr, Div Agr Forest & Biosyst Engn, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy.",zablon@huskers.unl.edu; vzlotnik1@unl.edu; Nathan.Rossman@hdrinc.com; tiejun.wang@tju.edu.cn; paolo.nasta@unina.it,"Wang, Tiejun/N-3430-2016; Nasta, Paolo/F-7820-2012","nasta, paolo/0000-0001-9654-566X; Antzelevich Zlotnik, Vitaly/0000-0002-9601-9464",NSF IGERT program [DGE-0903469]; Nebraska Geological Society's Yatkola-Edwards scholarship; American Association of Petroleum Geologists,NSF IGERT program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Nebraska Geological Society's Yatkola-Edwards scholarship; American Association of Petroleum Geologists,"The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the NSF IGERT program (DGE-0903469), the Nebraska Geological Society's Yatkola-Edwards scholarship and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.",,65,18,19,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,11,5,,,,,,,950,10.3390/w11050950,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11050950,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IE9FN,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000472680400080,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, much of the information critical to decision making remains undocumented and is not stored in a structured way. This study explores the integration of AI, specifically ChatGPT, into Theory of Constraints (TOC) Thinking Process (TP) tools. Method In this study, we applied ChatGPT to a real-world IT project management case using a variety of research methods, including international literature analysis, observation, and personal experience. The use of the TOC TP allowed us to understand the decision-making process of ChatGPT and to systematically explore its advantages and limitations in creating logical trees of TOC TP. Results ChatGPT significantly enhanced efficiency and depth in TOC TP data collection and analysis, effectively addressing logical leaps for more coherent structures. It also promoted deeper analytical thinking and aided root cause identification. The integration of ChatGPT into the TOC TP process led to faster decision-making, reduced bias, and clearer analysis. Challenges of ChatGPT including the need for human oversight, specific TOC TP training, and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion This study provides an initial investigation into the use of ChatGPT in TOC TP tools. The results suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool for organizations seeking to improve their decision making and performance. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the full potential of AI in TOC TP.","[Aljaz, Tomaz] Fac Informat Studies, Novo Mesto, Slovenia",,"Aljaz, T (corresponding author), Fac Informat Studies, Novo Mesto, Slovenia.",tomaz.aljaz@fis.unm.si,,,,,,,13,1,1,12,20,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1318-5454,1581-1832,,ORGANIZACIJA,Organizacija,MAY 1,2024,57,2,,,,,202,214,,10.2478/orga-2024-0014,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/orga-2024-0014,,,13,Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,QD0M1,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001218822900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

More specifically, it explores how prioritizing the capturing of IP as a central researcher responsibility can cause disruptions to research relationships and project outcomes. We argue that boundary-making processes associated with IP create a particular context through which responsibility can, and must, be located and cultivated by researchers working within transdisciplinary collaborations. We draw from interview data and situated IP practices from a transdisciplinary co-design project in Aotearoa New Zealand to illustrate how IP is a fluid boundary-requiring-and-producing object that impels researchers into its management, and produces tensions that need to be noticed and skillfully navigated within research relations. We propose located response-ability as a conceptual tool and practice to reposition IP within the relations that make up a transdisciplinary co-design project, as opposed to prioritizing IP by default without recognizing its possible impacts on collaborative relations and other project aims and accountabilities. This can support researchers practicing responsible innovation in making everyday decisions on how to protect potential IP without disrupting the collaborative relations that make the creation of potential IP possible, and the existence of protected IP relevant and beneficial to project collaborators and wider societal actors. This may help to ensure that societal benefits can be generated, and positive science-society relationships prioritized and preserved, in the design of new AgTech.","[Burch, Karly Ann] Univ Otago, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Nafus, Dawn] Intel, Portland, OR USA; [Legun, Katharine; Klerkx, Laurens] Wageningen Univ, POB 9101, NL-6700 HB Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Otago; Intel Corporation; Intel USA; Wageningen University & Research,"Burch, KA (corresponding author), Univ Otago, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",karly.burch@otago.ac.nz; dawn.nafus@intel.com; katharine.legun@wur.nl; laurens.klerkx@wur.nl,"Klerkx, Laurens/ABD-4957-2021","Burch, Karly/0000-0001-7887-6115; Klerkx, Laurens/0000-0002-1664-886X","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [UOAX1810]; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [UOAX1810] Funding Source: New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE)(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

OHIO aims to enhance the productivity and quality of medical equipment maintenance activities within the pilot hospital, Le Scotte in Siena (Italy), by leveraging internal informational resources. OHIO will also be completely integrated with the ODIN platform, taking advantage of the available services and functionalities. OHIO exploits Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and antennas together with the resources provided by the ODIN platform to develop a complex ontology-based IoT framework, which acts as a central cockpit for the maintenance of medical equipment through a central management web application and an indoor real-time location system (RTLS) for mobile devices. The application programmable interfaces (APIs) are based on REST architecture for seamless data exchange and integration with the hospital's existing computer-aided facility management (CAFM) and computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software. The outcomes of the project are assessed both with quantitative and qualitative methods, by evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs) extracted from the literature and performing a preliminary usability test on both the whole system and the graphic user interfaces (GUIs) of the developed applications. The test implementation demonstrates improvements in maintenance timings, including a reduction in maintenance operation delays, duration of maintenance tasks, and equipment downtime. Usability post-test questionnaires show positive feedback regarding the usability and effectiveness of the applications. The OHIO framework enhanced the effectiveness of medical equipment maintenance by integrating existing software with newly designed, enhanced interfaces.

However, the derived methodologies and tools lack transparency, due to the black-box nature of the employed machine learning models, leading to decreased trust in their results. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we extend the state-of-the-art and -practice by building explainable AI models on top of machine learning ones, to interpret the factors (i.e. software metrics) that constitute a module as in risk of having high technical debt (HIGH TD), to obtain thresholds for metric scores that are alerting for poor maintainability, and finally, we dig further to achieve local interpretation that explains the specific problems of each module, pinpointing to specific opportunities for improvement during TD management. To achieve this goal, we have developed project-specific classifiers (characterizing modules as HIGH and NOT-HIGH TD) for 21 open-source projects, and we explain their rationale using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis. Based on our analysis, complexity, comments ratio, cohesion, nesting of control flow statements, coupling, refactoring activity, and code churn are the most important reasons for characterizing classes as in HIGH TD risk. The analysis is complemented with global and local means of interpretation, such as metric thresholds and case-by-case reasoning for characterizing a class as in-risk of having HIGH TD.

This study investigated the adoption of Lean Construction (LC) practices and AI/IoT technologies in Iran's public construction sector using a mixed-methods approach. This research examined the organizational, technical, and infrastructural factors across four key provinces-Tehran, Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi, and Fars-and employed fuzzy logic to address the uncertainties in adoption decisions. Data from 28 key stakeholder interviews were analyzed using Python 3.9, with libraries such as Pandas 1.3.3, NumPy 1.21.2, and skfuzzy 0.4.2 for the statistical analysis and NVivo 12 for the thematic coding. The analysis revealed that organizational readiness and leadership support were the critical drivers of adoption, particularly in Isfahan and Khorasan Razavi, which exhibited the highest adoption likelihood scores (0.5000). Tehran and Fars showed slightly lower scores due to regulatory barriers and financial limitations. The findings highlight the need for targeted leadership training, regulatory reforms, and infrastructure investments to accelerate the adoption of these technologies. This study aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure and SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities) by offering practical recommendations for advancing sustainable practices in Iran's construction sector.

Southeast Asia has experienced widespread deforestation and change in land use. Consequently, many reforestation projects have been initiated in this region. However, it is imperative to carefully choose the tree species for planting, especially in light of the increasing climate variability and the potential alteration of plantation on the watershed water balance. Thus, the information regarding water-use characteristics of various tree species and sizes is critical in the tree species selection for reforestation.Methods. We estimated tree water use (T) of dominant species including Syzygium antisepticum and Adinandra integerrima, hereafter Sa and Ai, respectively, in a secondary tropical forest in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, using sap flow data, and compared T between species and size classes. Additionally, we evaluated the responses of T of both species in each size class to environmental factors including soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Results. Results showed consistently higher T in Sa compared to Ai across ranges of VPD and soil moisture. Under low soil moisture, T of Sa responded to VPD, following a saturating exponential pattern while Ai maintained T across different VPD levels, irrespective of tree size. No responses of T to VPD were observed in either species when soil water was moderate. When soil moisture was high, T of both species significantly increased and saturated at high VPD, albeit the responses were less sensitive in large trees. Our results imply that Ai may be suitable for reforestation in water-limited areas where droughts frequently occur to minimize reforestation impact on water availability to downstream ecosystems. In contrast, Sa should be planted in regions with abundant considered to increase forest resilience to increasing climate variation.","[Ampornpitak, Ratchanon] Chulalongkorn Univ, Grad Sch, Int Program Hazardous Subst & Environm Management, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ampornpitak, Ratchanon] Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Hazardous Subst Management, Bangkok, Thailand; [Nathalang, Anuttara] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Natl Biobank Thailand, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Tor-ngern, Pantana] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tor-ngern, Pantana] Chulalongkorn Univ, Water Sci & Technol Sustainable Environm Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University; National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University,"Tor-ngern, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.;Tor-ngern, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Water Sci & Technol Sustainable Environm Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand.",pantana.t@chula.ac.th,"Nathalang, Anuttara/P-3925-2018; Tor-ngern, Pantana/IRZ-7715-2023",,"Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University [DIS66230005]; Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST); National Science and Technology Development Agency [SCA-CO-2564-14439-TH]; International Postgraduate Program in Hazardous Substance and Environmental Management, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University","Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University; Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST); National Science and Technology Development Agency; International Postgraduate Program in Hazardous Substance and Environmental Management, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University","This research was funded by the Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University (DIS66230005).

Many basic schools lack basic educational resources such as sitting places and writing places for learners. Inadequate teaching and learning resources negatively affect the educational policies in a country. It is common to see the media projecting the challenges of a school lacking these resources. The use of an Expert System (ES) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist in effective management is a necessity. In this paper, an agile neural expert system is proposed using differential equations with an initial value problem. The technique combines both rule-based and neural networks in handling the problem. The expertise of the Human Expert (HE) is used in a knowledge-based to assist in managing the resources in schools. This has been possible with the use of Data Mining (DM) techniques and modeling of projected population growth, affecting enrolment in schools and necessitating the provision of resources to cater to the growing population. For efficiency and effectiveness in planning, provision, and management of the resources, smart notification has been embedded in the system to monitor the availability and provision of the resources by prompting the various actors in the requisition, verification, validation, and approval of resources to be supplied to schools. The system proves a higher efficiency demonstrating speed in decision-making, accuracy in decisions and ease to use.","[Inusah, Fuseini] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Math & ICT Educ, Tamale, Ghana; [Missah, Yaw Marfo; Najim, Ussiph; Twum, Frimpong] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Kumasi, Ghana",University for Development Studies; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Inusah, F (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Math & ICT, Tamale, Ghana.",finusah@uds.edu.gh,"; TWUM, FRIMPONG/GMX-3413-2022","FUSEINI, INUSAH/0000-0001-9785-4464; TWUM, FRIMPONG/0000-0002-1869-7542",,,,,43,3,3,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2667-3053,,INTELL SYST APPL,Intell.

Recently, several studies have been conducted to predict WGR using artificial intelligence (AI) to the end of realizing smart waste management. Additionally, to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) predictive models, several strategies have also been tested of recent. This study aimed to develop a hybrid ML predictive model to enhance prediction performance for small datasets consisting mainly of categorical variables. Artificial neural network (multi-layer perceptron) (ANN (MLP)) and support vector machine regression (SVMR) algorithms were selected, and cate-gorical principal components analysis (CATPCA) was applied. Accordingly, four predictive models-ANN (MLP), SVMR, CATPCA-ANN (MLP), and CATPCA-SVMR-were developed. The CATPCA-ANN (MLP) model showed some improvements in statistical metrics as compared to the ANN (MLP) model, and the CATPCA-SVMR model showed a far better performance across all statistical metrics than the SVMR model. The best prediction per-formance was found in the CATPCA-SVMR model (R2 = 0.594, R = 0.770), which was thus considered the best model of the four developed. Here, the mean DWGR was 1165.04 kg/m2 for the observed values, and that for the predicted values was 1161.52 kg/m2. Thus, a novel method was proposed for developing a hybrid ML model to enhance prediction performance for small datasets consisting of categorical variables. The results of this study enable the use of ML algorithms, which are disadvantageous with respect to use of categorical variables, by using CATPCA, and we suggest a new AI approach to develop a predictive DWGR model with excellent predictive performance.","[Cha, Gi-Wook] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Sci & Technol Accelerat Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea; [Moon, Hyeun Jun] Dankook Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Yongin 16890, South Korea; [Kim, Young -Chan] Dongguk Univ, Div Smart Safety Engn, 123 Dongdae-ro,wise campus, Gyeongju 38066, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU); Dankook University; Dongguk University,"Moon, HJ (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Yongin 16890, South Korea.",cgwgnr@gmail.com; honjunmoon@gmail.com; yyoungchani@gmail.com,,"Cha, Gi-Wook/0000-0001-8590-6482","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2021R1A2B5B02002699, NRF-2019R1A2C1088446]; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20212020800050, 20212020800120]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP)(Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation & Planning (KETEP)); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (NRF-2019R1A2C1088446).

Despite technological advancements in oncology, challenges remain in many aspects related to cancer management. This study constitutes one part of the user requirement definition of INCISIVE EU H2020 project, which has been designed to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies in cancer imaging. The study aimed to explore cancer survivors' experiences of cancer care in five European countries. MethodsA qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews was conducted. A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit participants across the five validation countries of INCISIVE project: Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, and Serbia. Forty cancer survivors were interviewed between November 2020 and March 2021. Data was analysed thematically using the framework approach and coded using NVivo12 software. ResultsThe analysis yielded several gaps within the cancer care pathway which reflected on the participants experiences. Five key themes were revealed; (1) perceived challenges during the cancer journey, (2) the importance of accurate and prompt diagnosis, (3) perceived need for improving cancer diagnosis, (4) absence of well-established/designated support services within the pathway and (5) suggestions to improve cancer care pathway. ConclusionCancer survivors experienced significant burdens pertaining to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our findings underscored some main gaps within the cancer care pathway which contributed to the challenges articulated by the participants including lack of resources and delays in diagnostic and treatment intervals. Additionally, several suggestions were provided by the cancer survivors which could be considered towards the improvement of the current state of care, some of which can be optimised using new technologies involving AI such as the one proposed by INCISIVE.","[Hesso, Iman; Kayyali, Reem; Nabhani-Gebara, Shereen] Kingston Univ London, Sch Life Sci Pharm & Chem, Kingston Upon Thames, England; [Charalambous, Andreas] Cyprus Univ Technol, Nursing Dept, Limassol, Cyprus; [Lavdaniti, Maria; Stalika, Evangelia] Int Hellen Univ, Nursing Dept, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Stalika, Evangelia; Lelegianni, Maria] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Med, Thessaloniki, Greece",Kingston University; Cyprus University of Technology; International Hellenic University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Nabhani-Gebara, S (corresponding author), Kingston Univ London, Sch Life Sci Pharm & Chem, Kingston Upon Thames, England.",S.Nabhani@kingston.ac.uk,"Charalambous, Andreas/R-5753-2018; Nabhani-Gebara, Shereen/M-7050-2017",,European commission [952179],European commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This work was supported by the European commission under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No.952179.,,39,1,1,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2234-943X,,,FRONT ONCOL,Front.

In recent years, hydro-meteorological data have multiplied in some Typhoon Committee (TC) Members. Data-based advanced technology applications in TC, such as application of Artificial Intelligent (AI) and impact-based typhoon disaster forecasting and early warning, has emerged one after another. A consistent and integrated data quality management system is crucial for ensuring accurate hydrological and meteorological analysis and prediction. Considering the importance and urgent necessary, TC working group on hydrology (WGH) conducted a cooperation project on data quality management in the past years with the major objective of improving the capacity of TC Members on integrated data quality control and processing. Despite the significant improvements, the uncertainties and difficulties in processing the full-elements of hydrometeorological data still persist in hydro-meteorological data. To tackle these challenges and further enhance the data quality management system, the integration of AI technology shows great promise. By examining the data quality management system at World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as a starting point, this paper explored how related organizations in China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Republic of Korea, manage the quality of hydro-meteorological data; reviewed the current status of hydro-meteorological data quality control in TC Members, and discussed the potential areas to be enhanced in future.

Continuous development of new empirical models in recent decades reveals the importance of accurate prediction of this factor in diverse ground and machine conditions. The great number of different parameters influencing TBM performance and the high variability linked to specific field conditions cause the problem to be very complex. Gene expression programming (GEP) models, a robust variant of genetic programming, are developed in this study to correlate hard rock TBM performance with routine ground properties for project design applications. The developed models are compared with those from statistical and soft computing-based models in the literature. Overall, GEP models show good performance and are proven to be much better than the previous models.

This research aims to develop models for automating the review of construction contracts to extract information on risk and responsibility that will provide inputs for risk management plans. Models were trained on 2268 sentences from International Federation of Consulting Engineers templates and tested on an actual construction project contract containing 1217 sentences. A taxonomy classified sentences into Heading, Definition, Obligation, Risk, and Right categories with related parties of Contractor, Employer, and Shared. Twelve models employing diverse Natural Language Processing vectorization techniques and Machine Learning algorithms were implemented and benchmarked based on accuracy and F1 score. Binary classification of sentence types and an ensemble method integrating top models were further applied to improve performance. The best model achieved 89 % accuracy for sentence types and 83 % for related parties, demonstrating the capabilities of automated contract review for identification of risk and responsibilities. Adopting the proposed approach can significantly expedite contract reviews to support risk management activities, bid preparation processes and prevent disputes caused by overlooking risks and responsibilities.","[Dikmen, Irem; Erol, Huseyin] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Whiteknights Campus,Chancellors Bldg, Reading RG6 6AH, England; [Eken, Gorkem; Birgonul, M.

First, the integration framework of IIS is proposed, including data collection and storage, data analysis, and data expression modules. According to this framework, the remaining problems existing in each component are pointed out and the corresponding optimization measures are given. Especially for the processing technology of massive monitoring data, some trained machine learning algorithms are introduced for data analysis. As a case study, the devised system was adopted in an underwater shield tunnel for real-time monitoring, big data analysis, and information visualization.

As losses are caused by the inefficiency of the export method, selecting the appropriate export method is a possible solution. Several organizations employ only a single strategy, which is mainly based on a first-in-first-out approach. Such a policy is easy to manage but inefficient. Given that the batch of fruits may become overripe during transportation, frontline operators do not have the authority or immediate support to change the fruit dispatching strategy. Thus, this study aims to develop a dynamic strategy simulator to determine the sequence of delivery based on forecasting information projected from probabilistic data to reduce the amount of fruit loss.Methods The proposed method to accomplish asynchronous federated learning (FL) is based on blockchain technology and a serially interacting smart contract. In this method, each party in the chain updates its model parameters and uses a voting system to reach a consensus. This study employs blockchain technology with smart contracts to serially enable asynchronous FL, with each party in the chain updating its parameter model. A smart contract combines a global model with a voting system to reach a common consensus. Its artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things engine further strengthen the support for implementing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model. Based on AI technology, a system was constructed using FL in a decentralized governance AI policy on a blockchain network platform.Results With mangoes being selected as the category of fruit in the study, the system improves the cost-effectiveness of the fruit (mango) supply chain. In the proposed approach, the simulation outcomes show fewer mangoes lost (0.035%) and operational costs reduced.Discussion The proposed method shows improved cost-effectiveness in the fruit supply chain through the use of AI technology and blockchain. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an Indonesian mango supply chain business case study has been selected. The results of the Indonesian mango supply chain case study indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing fruit loss and operational costs.","[Lee, C. Alisdair; Chan, H.

We have produced substantial numbers of systems that,function as products for commercial applications, and as advanced research tools specifically designed for experimental use. This paper reviews various aspects of the design and control of a number of robot-like machines ranging from our first projects, the Utah Arm and the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand, to present work on humanoid robots and the Wearable Energetically Autonomous Robot (WEAR). Our systems have been used in: entertainment, operator remotization from hazardous environments, R&D, and medicine. In addition to the robots and their subsystems, extensive work has been devoted to command systems that drive the robots. Command systems have been: playback supervisors, teleoperation masters, and various higher level approaches based on work from the AI community Playback interfaces have included motion capture mechanisms that provide movement-stream information to storage systems configured for later, repeated and coordinated, operation of many, robots and associated mechanisms. Play-back command systems use human commands, from an earlier time, to command motions that are played out, over and over, mindlessly. Teleoperation masters, that operate in real-time with the robot, have ranged from simple motion capture devices, to more complex,force reflective exoskeletal masters. Teleoperation interfaces have been composed of complex kinematic structures designed to perform motions compatible with operator movements and are attached via appropriate soft tissue interfaces. The masters emit lower level commands (joint angles) in real-time using the natural intelligence and sensory systems of the operator AI-based command sources, blend higher level (simple) commands, with system and existing environmental states, to make decisions for the management of the robot. As with the playback systems, AI-based systems are programmed earlier to perform later operations. In the AI case, however adaptive intelligence and sensory capabilities reside in the robot. Our general design approach has been to begin with the definition of desired objective behaviors, rather than the use of available components with their predefined technical specifications. With the technical specifications of the components necessary to achieve the desired behaviors defined, the components are either acquired, or in most cases, developed and built. The control system, which includes the operation of feedback approaches, acting in collaboration with physical machinery, is then defined and implemented. Control is considered a function of both feedback, and the designed-in performance of the robot's physical machinery. It has not been true that bad performance from physical machine elements can be simply compensated out via innovative control methods and faster computers. After the completion of many projects we believe that the final frontier(s) of robotics reside at both ends of the brain and brawn spectrum. Both frontiers (barriers) are related to autonomy intelligence/computation and energy/power Recently, energetic antonomy has become a major interest at Sarcos and projects are underway to develop appropriate,fuel-based servo-actuators to satisfy, that need. Our objective is to develop powersystems that are capable producing high performance servo-quality actuation for extended operating times without reenergizing the system. At the other end of the spectrum, we are working in collaboration with various groups to supply physical robots capable of operation under the control of advanced AI-based systems.","Sarcos Res Corp, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; Univ Utah, Ctr Engn Design, Salt Lake City, UT 84104 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Jacobsen, SC (corresponding author), Sarcos Res Corp, 360 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA.",,,,,,,,5,29,70,4,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0278-3649,,,INT J ROBOT RES,Int.

In the context of real-time monitoring of networked systems, it is crucial that new solutions do not increase the burden on an already overloaded visual channel. Sonification can be leveraged as a peripheral monitoring tool that complements current visualization systems. We conceptualized, designed, and prototyped Datascapes, a framework project that explores the potential of sound-based applications for the monitoring of cyber-attacks on AI-supported networked environments. Within Datascapes, two Design Actions were realized that applied sonification on the monitoring and detection of anomalies in (1) water distribution networks and (2) Internet networks. Two series of prototypes were implemented and evaluated in a real-world environment with eight experts in network management and cybersecurity. This paper presents experimental results on the use of sonification to disclose anomalous behavior and assess both its gravity and the location within the network. Furthermore, we define and present a design methodology and evaluation protocol that, albeit grounded in sonification for anomaly detection, can support designers in the definition, development, and validation of real-world sonification applications.","[Lenzi, Sara] Univ Deusto, Fac Engn, Bilbao, Spain; [Lenzi, Sara] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain; [Lenzi, Sara; Terenghi, Ginevra] Politecn Milan, Dept Design, Milan, Italy; [Meacci, Damiano] Conservatorio Mus Luigi Cherubini, Dept Mus & New Technol, Florence, Italy; [Meacci, Damiano] Tempo Reale, Florence, Italy; [Moreno Fernandez-de-Leceta, Aitor] Inst Ibermat Innovac i3B, Vitoria, Spain; [Ciuccarelli, Paolo] Northeastern Univ, Coll Arts Media & Design, Ctr Design, Boston, MA USA",University of Deusto; Basque Foundation for Science; Polytechnic University of Milan; Northeastern University,"Lenzi, S (corresponding author), Univ Deusto, Fac Engn, Bilbao, Spain.;Lenzi, S (corresponding author), Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain.;Lenzi, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Design, Milan, Italy.",sara.lenzi@deusto.es,"Lenzi, Sara/HKE-6233-2023","Lenzi, Sara/0000-0001-5534-0596; Meacci, Damiano/0000-0002-0379-8674","Department of Design of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy; Government of the Basque Country","Department of Design of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy; Government of the Basque Country","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Along with other countries, Bulgaria has committed to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and reflected them in its strategic documents. EO is one of the priority technologies for the development of the Bulgarian space sector. This paper analyzes how EO data could significantly help Bulgarian authorities in achieving and monitoring the progress of the SDG targets based on three specific EO monitoring pilot projects' results (showcases) focused more on the policy management approach than scientific achievement. The first project showed the opportunities of EO data for integration of a national (local) geospatial database with the existing international networks for monitoring natural disasters and accidents. The second demonstrated the time series usage of EO data for water quality monitoring.

The ASCEND-LUNG study is a prospective two-stage case-control - control study designed to evaluate the performance of a liquid biopsy-based comprehensive lung cancer screening and post-screening pulmonary nodules management system. Methods We aimed to develop a comprehensive lung cancer system called Peking University Lung Cancer Screening and Management System (PKU-LCSMS) which comprises a lung cancer screening model to identify specific fi c populations requiring LDCT and an artificial fi cial intelligence-aided (AI-aided) pulmonary nodules diagnostic model to classify pulmonary nodules following LDCT. A dataset of 465 participants (216 cancer, 47 benign, 202 non-cancer control) were used for the two models' ' development phase. For the lung cancer screening model development, cancer participants were randomly split at a ratio of 1:1 into the train and validation cohorts, and then non-cancer controls were age-matched to the cancer cases in a 1:1 ratio. Similarly, for the AI-aided pulmonary nodules model, cancer and benign participants were also randomly divided at a ratio of 2:1 into the train and validation cohorts. Subsequently, during the model validation phase, sensitivity and specificity fi city were validated using an independent validation cohort consisting of 291 participants (140 cancer, 25 benign, 126 non-cancer control). Prospectively collected blood samples were analyzed for multi-omics including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation, mutation, and serum protein. Computerized tomography (CT) images data was also obtained. Paired tissue samples were additionally analyzed for DNA methylation, DNA mutation, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression to further explore the potential biological mechanisms. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04817046. Findings Baseline blood samples were evaluated for the whole screening and diagnostic process. The cfDNA methylation-based lung cancer screening model exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.910 (95% CI, 0.869-0.950), - 0.950), followed by the protein model (0.891 [95% CI, 0.845-0.938]) - 0.938]) and lastly the mutation model (0.577 [95% CI, 0.482-0.672]). - 0.672]). Further, the fi nal screening model, which incorporated cfDNA methylation and protein features, achieved an AUC of 0.963 (95% CI, 0.942-0.984). - 0.984). In the independent validation cohort, the multi-omics screening model showed a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI, 0.957-1.000) - 1.000) at a specificity fi city of 56.3% (95% CI, 0.472-0.652). - 0.652). For the AI-aided pulmonary nodules diagnostic model, which incorporated cfDNA methylation and CT images features, it yielded a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% CI, 0.732-0.875), - 0.875), a specificity fi city of 76.0% (95% CI, 0.549-0.906) - 0.906) in the independent validation cohort. Furthermore, four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were shared in the lung cancer screening model and the AI-aided pulmonary nodules diagnostic model. Interpretation We developed and validated a liquid biopsy-based comprehensive lung cancer screening and management system called PKU-LCSMS which combined a blood multi-omics based lung cancer screening model incorporating cfDNA methylation and protein features and an AI-aided pulmonary nodules diagnostic model integrating CT images and cfDNA methylation features in sequence to streamline the entire process of lung cancer screening and post-screening pulmonary nodules management. It might provide a promising applicable solution for lung cancer screening and management.

Although various studies have investigated the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening, policymakers facing with uncontrollably growing total health expenses were deeply concerned about the potential financial consequences of glaucoma screening. This present study was aimed to explore the impact of glaucoma screening with artificial intelligence (AI) automated diagnosis from a budgetary standpoint in Changjiang county, China.MethodsA Markov model based on health care system's perspective was adapted from previously published studies to predict disease progression and healthcare costs. A cohort of 19,395 individuals aged 65 and above were simulated over a 15-year timeframe. Fur illustrative purpose, we only considered primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in this study. Prevalence, disease progression risks between stages, compliance rates were obtained from publish studies. We did a meta-analysis to estimate diagnostic performance of AI automated diagnosis system from fundus image. Screening costs were provided by the Changjiang screening programme, whereas treatment costs were derived from electronic medical records from two county hospitals. Main outcomes included the number of PACG patients and health care costs. Cost-offset analysis was employed to compare projected health outcomes and medical care costs under the screening with what they would have been without screening. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify uncertainties around model results.ResultsAmong people aged 65 and above in Changjiang county, it was predicted that there were 1940 PACG patients under the AI-assisted screening scenario, compared with 2104 patients without screening in 15years' time. Specifically, the screening would reduce patients with primary angle closure suspect by 7.7%, primary angle closure by 8.8%, PACG by 16.7%, and visual blindness by 33.3%. Due to early diagnosis and treatment under the screening, healthcare costs surged dramatically to $107,761.4 dollar in the first year and then were constantly declining over time, while without screening costs grew from $14,759.8 in the second year until peaking at $17,900.9 in the 9th year. However, cost-offset analysis revealed that additional healthcare costs resulted from the screening could not be offset by decreased disease progression. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year accumulated incremental costs of screening versus no screening were estimated to be $396,362.8, $424,907.9, and $434,903.2, respectively. As a result, the incremental cost per PACG of any stages prevented was $1464.3.ConclusionsThis study represented the first attempt to address decision-maker's budgetary concerns when adopting glaucoma screening by developing a Markov prediction model to project health outcomes and costs. Population screening combined with AI automated diagnosis for PACG in China were able to reduce disease progression risks. However, the excess costs of screening could never be offset by reduction in disease progression. Further studies examining the cost-effectiveness or cost-utility of AI-assisted glaucoma screening were needed.","[Xiao, Xuan] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Eye Ctr, Wuhan 430060, Peoples R China; [Xue, Long; Li, Hongzheng; He, Yunzhen] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Ye, Lin] Jinan Univ, Shenzhen Eye Hosp, Dept Eye Plast & Lacrimal Dis, Shenzhen 518040, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Fudan University; Shenzhen Eye Hospital; Jinan University,"He, YZ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",yogurtfdu@gmail.com,,"Xue, Long/0000-0003-1856-9281",National Nature Science Foundation of China [81100644]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2015CFB568]; Shenzhen Sanming Project [SZSM201512039],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Shenzhen Sanming Project,"This study was funded by National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 81100644), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (No. 2015CFB568) and Shenzhen Sanming Project (No. SZSM201512039).",,36,17,17,3,39,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2458,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,JUN 4,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1065,10.1186/s12889-021-11097-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11097-w,,,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",SR2IC,34088286,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000660866100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The application will be tested in the Stadel Museum, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. To develop a proper Natural Language Understanding module, we adapted an existing categorization approach, gathered visitor questions, and structured them into twelve distinct content types. The preliminary results suggest that our approach to subdivide the previously overloaded content type meaning into further categories was successful, leading to a more balanced distribution of the data. We further describe the Natural Language Processing mechanisms employed here; these follow a multitiered approach using techniques like Rasa, BERT, and cosine-similarity to generate answers with different degrees of effort. Future steps are the implementation of dialog management, the refinement of the NLP strategies by integrating additional answers for selected exhibits, and the implementation of the final layout and interaction design.

The primary objective is to quantify the impact of circular practices on resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. A mixed-methods approach combines qualitative case studies with quantitative modelling using the Brazilian Land-Use Model for Energy Scenarios (BLUES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). These models project long-term trends in emissions reduction and resource optimization. Significant findings include a 20-25% reduction in waste production and an improvement in recycling efficiency from 50% to 83% over a decade. Predictive models demonstrated high accuracy, with less than a 5% deviation from actual performance metrics, supported by error metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Statistical validations confirm the reliability of these forecasts. The study highlights the potential for circular economy practices to reduce reliance on virgin materials and lower carbon emissions while emphasizing the critical role of policy support and technological innovation. This integrated approach offers actionable insights for industries seeking sustainable growth, providing a robust framework for future resource efficiency and environmental management applications.","[Oladapo, Bankole I.] Univ Dundee, Sch Sci & Engn, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Olawumi, Mattew A.] De Montfort Univ, Comp Engn & Media, Leicester LE1 9BH, England; [Omigbodun, Francis T.] Loughborough Univ, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England",University of Dundee; De Montfort University; Loughborough University,"Oladapo, BI (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Sci & Engn, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",boladapo001@dundee.ac.uk; olawumisola13@gmail.com; f.omigbodun@lboro.ac.uk,"Omigbodun, Francis/LGY-1416-2024","OMIGBODUN, FRANCIS TOBI/0000-0002-9745-5655",,,,,59,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2024,16,23,,,,,,,10358,10.3390/su162310358,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162310358,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,P5G1L,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001378179800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on the typology of galaxies using data from the Galaxy Zoo project, where classifications are based on the opinions of non-expert volunteers, introducing a degree of uncertainty. The objective of this study is to integrate Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering with explainability methods to achieve a precise and interpretable model for galaxy classification. We applied FCM to manage this uncertainty and group galaxies based on their morphological characteristics. Additionally, we used explainability methods, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), to interpret and explain the key factors influencing the classification. The results show that using FCM allows for accurate classification while managing data uncertainty, with high precision values that meet the expectations of the study. Additionally, SHAP values and LIME provide a clear understanding of the most influential features in each cluster. This method enhances our classification and understanding of galaxies and is extendable to environmental studies on Earth, offering tools for environmental management and protection. The presented methodology highlights the importance of integrating FCM and XAI techniques to address complex problems with uncertain data.","[Diaz, Gabriel Marin] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Medina, Raquel Gomez; Jimenez, Jose Alberto Aijon] Univ Europea Madrid, Sci & Aerosp Dept, Villaviciosa De Odon 28670, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; European University of Madrid,"Díaz, GM (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain.",gmarin03@ucm.es; raquel.gomez@universidadeuropea.es; josealberto.aijon@universidadeuropea.es,"Gomez-Medina, Raquel/J-7489-2012; Marín Díaz, Gabriel/ABK-4389-2022","Marin Diaz, Gabriel/0000-0001-5819-3114; Aijon Jimenez, Jose Alberto/0009-0003-5452-7019",,,,,37,1,1,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,SEP,2024,12,18,,,,,,,2797,10.3390/math12182797,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math12182797,,,27,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,H4I6H,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001323097600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in HCC aims to improve the performance of image recognition. Herein, we thoroughly analyze and evaluate proposed AI models in the field of HCC diagnosis.MethodsA comprehensive review of the literature was performed utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases with the end of search date being the 30th of September 2023. The MESH terms Artificial Intelligence, Liver Cancer, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning were searched in the title and/or abstract. All references of the obtained articles were also evaluated for any additional information.ResultsOur search resulted in 183 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Across all diagnostic modalities, reported area under the curve (AUC) of most developed models surpassed 0.900. A B-mode US and a contrast-enhanced US model achieved AUCs of 0.947 and 0.957, respectively. Regarding the more challenging task of HCC diagnosis, a 2021 deep learning model, trained with CT scans, classified hepatic malignant lesions with an AUC of 0.986. Finally, a MRI machine learning model developed in 2021 displayed an AUC of 0.975 when differentiating small HCCs from benign lesions, while another MRI-based model achieved HCC diagnosis with an AUC of 0.970.ConclusionsAI tools may lead to significant improvement in diagnostic management of HCC. Many models fared better or comparable to experienced radiologists while proving capable of elevating radiologists' accuracy, demonstrating promising results for AI implementation in HCC-related diagnostic tasks.","[Chatzipanagiotou, Odysseas P.; Vailas, Michail; Felekouras, Evangellos; Schizas, Dimitrios] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Laikon Gen Hosp, Dept Surg 1, Athens 11527, Greece; [Loukas, Constantinos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Med Sch, Lab Med Phys, Athens, Greece; [Machairas, Nikolaos; Kykalos, Stylianos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Laikon Gen Hosp, Dept Propaedeut Surg 2, Athens, Greece; [Charalampopoulos, Georgios; Filippiadis, Dimitrios] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Attikon Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol 2, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Laiko General Hospital; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Laiko General Hospital; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University Hospital Attikon,"Chatzipanagiotou, OP (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Laikon Gen Hosp, Dept Surg 1, Athens 11527, Greece.",odysseaspchatz@gmail.com,"Loukas, Constantinos/M-8890-2018; Machairas, Nikolaos/AAA-2982-2020; SCHIZAS, DIMITRIOS/Z-3323-2019","Machairas, Nikolaos/0000-0003-3239-3905; Chatzipanagiotou, Odysseas P/0009-0006-8377-0263",,,,,62,5,5,4,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0815-9319,1440-1746,,J GASTROEN HEPATOL,J.

The anatomical and physiological complexities of maxillofacial procedures necessitate a deep understanding of airway management strategies. Patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery often face heightened risks of airway compromise due to trauma, congenital abnormalities, or the surgical interventions themselves, requiring clinicians to be proficient in both routine and advanced techniques. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence and clinical practices in airway management for maxillofacial surgery. It examines the anatomical and physiological considerations, preoperative assessment protocols, intraoperative management, and postoperative care strategies. Preoperative assessments are crucial for identifying potential airway management difficulties, utilizing risk assessments, physical examinations, and imaging. Intraoperative strategies include endotracheal intubation while surgical techniques such as tracheostomy, cricothyroidotomy, submental, and retromolar intubation offer alternatives for securing the airway. Postoperative care focuses on meticulous planning and coordination to prevent complications such as airway obstruction and hypoxemia. Extubation is identified as a particularly high-risk phase, necessitating advanced techniques and multidisciplinary collaboration to ensure patient safety. The review underscores the importance of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to airway management in maxillofacial surgery, highlighting the need for ongoing advancements in techniques and technologies to enhance patient outcomes.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved. Our solution is a novel, scalable and accessible tool for disease management of diverse agricultural crop plants and can be deployed as a Cloud based service for farmers and experts for ecologically sustainable crop production.","[Singh, Kaushik Kunal] Inventure Acad, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Singh, KK (corresponding author), Inventure Acad, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",kunalsingh747@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,25,29,0,21,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-8260,,978-1-5386-9441-1,IEEE CONF CLOUD COMP,,,2018,,,,,,,49,56,,10.1109/CCEM.2018.00016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCEM.2018.00016,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BM5YO,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000465689800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cancer pain is multidimensional and management should be individualized to patient goals. The current standard for pain goal assessment is the personal pain goal (PPG), a numeric rating for tolerable pain intensity. However, the PPG may not accurately capture a personally meaningful goal for tailoring pain management. Objectives. Identify how pain goals are used in cancer pain management and types of goals researched. Methods. CINAHL, PsychInfo, and PubMed databases and manual searching were used to locate research or scholarship about cancer pain goals. Authors reviewed titles, abstracts and full text to agree on the final sample. Results. Sixteen articles met inclusion criteria. Study designs included: quality improvement project (1), concept analysis (1), qualitative methods (5), quantitative methods (8), and mixed methods (1). Findings included: goal setting as a key attribute of pain management; achieving personal goals as the outcome of pain management work; qualitative themes discussed personal goals related to pain management; developing a patient pain management resource including a SMART goal; using motivational interviewing to set functional pain goals; PPG assessment was feasible; and achieving PPG equated to having controlled pain when compared to the clinically important difference measure used in research (>= 30%). Quantitative studies reported on Conclusion. Currently, assessments for cancer pain goals do not include function, activities, moods, medication effects, or safety that patients wish to achieve as a pain management outcome. Development and testing of multidimensional patient pain goals assessments is warranted so that goals can be consistently assessed, documented, and personally meaningful.

This study primarily aimed to examine natural gradient boosting (NGBoost-2020) with the classification and regression trees (CART) base model (base learner). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this concept has never been applied to EVM AD forecasting problem. Consequently, the authors compared this method to the single K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, the ensemble method of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost-2016) with the CART base model and the optimal equation of EVM, the earned schedule (ES) equation with the performance factor equal to 1 (ES1). The paper also sought to determine the extent to which the World Bank's two legal factors affect countries and how the two legal causes of delay (related to institutional flaws) influence AD prediction models.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, data from 30 construction projects of various building types in Iran, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Malaysia and Nigeria (due to the high number of delayed projects and the detrimental effects of these delays in these countries) were used to develop three models. The target variable of the models was a dimensionless output, the ratio of estimated duration to completion (ETC(t)) to planned duration (PD). Furthermore, 426 tracking periods were used to build the three models, with 353 samples and 23 projects in the training set, 73 patterns (17% of the total) and six projects (21% of the total) in the testing set. Furthermore, 17 dimensionless input variables were used, including ten variables based on the main variables and performance indices of EVM and several other variables detailed in the study. The three models were subsequently created using Python and several GitHub-hosted codes.FindingsFor the testing set of the optimal model (NGBoost), the better percentage mean (better%) of the prediction error (based on projects with a lower error percentage) of the NGBoost compared to two KNN and ES1 single models, as well as the total mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean lags (MeLa) (indicating model stability) were 100, 83.33, 5.62 and 3.17%, respectively. Notably, the total MAPE and MeLa for the NGBoost model testing set, which had ten EVM-based input variables, were 6.74 and 5.20%, respectively. The ensemble artificial intelligence (AI) models exhibited a much lower MAPE than ES1. Additionally, ES1 was less stable in prediction than NGBoost. The possibility of excessive and unusual MAPE and MeLa values occurred only in the two single models. However, on some data sets, ES1 outperformed AI models. NGBoost also outperformed other models, especially single models for most developing countries, and was more accurate than previously presented optimized models. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the NGBoost predicted outputs of 30 projects using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. All variables demonstrated an effect on ETC(t)/PD. The results revealed that the most influential input variables in order of importance were actual time (AT) to PD, regulatory quality (RQ), earned duration (ED) to PD, schedule cost index (SCI), planned complete percentage, rule of law (RL), actual complete percentage (ACP) and ETC(t) of the ES optimal equation to PD. The probabilistic hybrid model was selected based on the outputs predicted by the NGBoost and XGBoost models and the MAPE values from three AI models. The 95% prediction interval of the NGBoost-XGBoost model revealed that 96.10 and 98.60% of the actual output values of the testing and training sets are within this interval, respectively.Research limitations/implicationsDue to the use of projects performed in different countries, it was not possible to distribute the questionnaire to the managers and stakeholders of 30 projects in six developing countries. Due to the low number of EVM-based projects in various references, it was unfeasible to utilize other types of projects. Future prospects include evaluating the accuracy and stability of NGBoost for timely and non-fluctuating projects (mostly in developed countries), considering a greater number of legal/institutional variables as input, using legal/institutional/internal/inflation inputs for complex projects with extremely high uncertainty (such as bridge and road construction) and integrating these inputs and NGBoost with new technologies (such as blockchain, radio frequency identification (RFID) systems, building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of things (IoT)).Practical implicationsThe legal/intuitive recommendations made to governments are strict control of prices, adequate supervision, removal of additional rules, removal of unfair regulations, clarification of the future trend of a law change, strict monitoring of property rights, simplification of the processes for obtaining permits and elimination of unnecessary changes particularly in developing countries and at the onset of irregular projects with limited information and numerous uncertainties. Furthermore, the managers and stakeholders of this group of projects were informed of the significance of seven construction variables (institutional/legal external risks, internal factors and inflation) at an early stage, using time series (dynamic) models to predict AD, accurate calculation of progress percentage variables, the effectiveness of building type in non-residential projects, regular updating inflation during implementation, effectiveness of employer type in the early stage of public projects in addition to the late stage of private projects, and allocating reserve duration (buffer) in order to respond to institutional/legal risks.Originality/valueEnsemble methods were optimized in 70% of references. To the authors' knowledge, NGBoost from the set of ensemble methods was not used to estimate construction project duration and delays. NGBoost is an effective method for considering uncertainties in irregular projects and is often implemented in developing countries. Furthermore, AD estimation models do fail to incorporate RQ and RL from the World Bank's worldwide governance indicators (WGI) as risk-based inputs. In addition, the various WGI, EVM and inflation variables are not combined with substantial degrees of delay institutional risks as inputs. Consequently, due to the existence of critical and complex risks in different countries, it is vital to consider legal and institutional factors. This is especially recommended if an in-depth, accurate and reality-based method like SHAP is used for analysis.","[Peiman, Farshad; Ravanshadnia, Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Khalilzadeh, Mohammad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Shahsavari-Pour, Nasser] ValiAsr Univ Rafsanjan, Dept Ind Management, Rafsanjan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Khalilzadeh, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",farshad.peiman@gmail.com; khalilzadeh@srbiau.ac.ir; shahsavari_n@alum.sharif.edu; ravanshadnia@gmail.com,"Ravanshadnia, Mehdi/L-1550-2018","KHALILZADEH, MOHAMMAD/0000-0002-2373-8505",,,,,77,3,3,26,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Design/methodology/approach The construction industry has been under pressure to improve its productivity, quality and sustainability. However, the conventional methods and technologies cannot respond to this industry's ever-growing demands while emerging and innovative technologies such as building information modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and AR have emerged and can be used to address this gap. AR application has been acknowledged as one of the most impactful technologies in the construction digitalization process. However, a comprehensive understanding of the AR application, its areas of effectiveness and overarching implications in a construction project life cycle remain vague. Therefore, this study uses an integration of systematic literature review and thematic analysis techniques to identify the phases of a construction project life cycle in which AR is the most effective, the current issues and problems of the conventional methods, the augmented parameters, the immediate effects of using AR on each phase and, eventually, the overall influence of AR on the entire project. Nvivo qualitative data analysis software was used to code, categorize and create themes from the collected data. The result of data analysis was used to develop four principal frameworks of the AR applications - design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and maintenance and defect inspection and management - and the gap analysis along with the future research agenda. Findings The findings of this study indicated that the application of AR can be most effective in the following four stages of a project life cycle: design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and site management and maintenance, including site management and defect inspection. The results also showed that the application of AR technology in the construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies, saving time, meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Research limitations/implications One of the main limitations of this study was the lack of materials and resources on the downfalls and shortcomings of using immersive technologies, AR, in the construction project life cycle. In addition, most of the reviewed papers were focused on the experiments with simulations and in the lab environment, rather than real experiments in real construction sites and projects. This may cause limitations and inaccuracy of the collected and reported data. Practical implications The results of this study indicated that the application of AR technology in construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies; saving time; meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling; and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Social implications Application of AR in the various stages of a project life cycle can increase the safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Originality/value The reviewed literature indicated that substantial research and studies are yet to be done, to demonstrate the full capacity and impact of these emerging technologies in the field. The collected data and literature indicate that amongst the digital technologies, AR is one of the least researched topics in the field. Therefore, this study aims to examine the application of AR in construction projects' life cycle to identify the stages and practices of a project life cycle where AR and its capabilities can be exploited and to identify the respective problems and issues of the conventional methods and the ways in which AR can address those shortcomings. Furthermore, this study focuses on identifying the overall outcome of AR applications in a construction project in terms of cost and time efficiency, process precision and safety.","[Hajirasouli, Aso] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Banihashemi, Saeed] Univ Canberra, Sch Design & Built Environm, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Drogemuller, Rob] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Fazeli, Abdulwahed] Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mohandes, Saeed Reza] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Canberra; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Iran University Science & Technology; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Hajirasouli, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Fac Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",a.hajirasouli@qut.edu.au; Saeed.Banihashemi@canberra.edu.au; robin.drogemuller@qut.edu.au; awahedfazeli@gmail.com; saeedreza.mohandes@polyu.edu.hk,"MOHANDES, SAEED REZA/HTN-4820-2023; fazeli, Abdulwahed/HNP-4747-2023; Banihashemi, Saeed/W-2808-2018","Banihashemi, Saeed/0000-0002-7438-1235; MOHANDES, SAEED REZA/0000-0001-9149-3928",,,,,117,30,31,12,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1471-4175,1477-0857,,CONSTR INNOV-ENGL,Constr.

Consequently, the arrival of multiple management solutions to cope with this explosion along the end-to-end network chain has increased the complexity in the coordinated orchestration of different segments composing the whole infrastructure. The Zero-touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) concept has recently emerged to automatically orchestrate and manage network resources while assuring the Quality of Experience (QoE) demanded by users. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the key enabling technologies that many ZSM frameworks are adopting to bring intelligent decision making to the network management system. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art application of ML-based techniques to improve ZSM performance. To this end, the main related standardization activities and the aligned international projects and research efforts are deeply examined. From this dissection, the skyrocketing growth of the ZSM paradigm can be observed. Concretely, different standardization bodies have already designed reference architectures to set the foundations of novel automatic network management functions and resource orchestration. Aligned with these advances, diverse ML techniques are being currently exploited to build further ZSM developments in different aspects, including multi-tenancy management, traffic monitoring, and architecture coordination, among others. However, different challenges, such as the complexity, scalability, and security of ML mechanisms, are also identified, and future research guidelines are provided to accomplish a firm development of the ZSM ecosystem.","[Gallego-Madrid, Jorge; Ruiz, Pedro M.; Skarmeta, Antonio F.] Univ Murcia, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Sanchez-Iborra, Ramon] Univ Ctr Def, Dept Engn & Appl Tech, San Javier Air Force Bas 30729, Spain",University of Murcia,"Sanchez-Iborra, R (corresponding author), Univ Ctr Def, Dept Engn & Appl Tech, San Javier Air Force Bas 30729, Spain.",ramon.sanchez@cud.upct.es,"Sanchez-Iborra, Ramon/HZJ-8548-2023; Gallego-Madrid, Jorge/AAF-8411-2019; Skarmeta Gomez, Antonio/K-4537-2014; Sanchez-Iborra, Ramon/E-1471-2014","Gallego-Madrid, Jorge/0000-0001-9429-8634; Skarmeta Gomez, Antonio/0000-0002-5525-1259; Sanchez-Iborra, Ramon/0000-0002-0069-3017","Fundacion Seneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Region de Murcia-under the FPI [21429/FPI/20]; Odin Solutions S.L.; Region de Murcia (Spain); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, under the projects ONOFRE 3 [PID2020-112675RB-C44]; ERDF funds; European Commission, under the INSPIRE-5Gplus [871808]","Fundacion Seneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Region de Murcia-under the FPI; Odin Solutions S.L.; Region de Murcia (Spain); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, under the projects ONOFRE 3; ERDF funds; European Commission, under the INSPIRE-5Gplus","This work has been supported by Fundacion Seneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Region de Murcia-under the FPI Grant 21429/FPI/20, and co-funded by Odin Solutions S.L., Region de Murcia (Spain); by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, under the projects ONOFRE 3 (Grant No. PID2020-112675RB-C44) and 5GHuerta (Grant No. EQC2019-006364-P) both with ERDF funds; and by the European Commission, under the INSPIRE-5Gplus (Grant No. 871808) project.",,103,51,51,1,10,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, Building 5, Room 411, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100009, PEOPLES R CHINA",2468-5925,2352-8648,,DIGIT COMMUN NETW,Digit.

The study developed a novel inference model, the neural network-long short-term memory (NN-LSTM) model, to estimate ESTC accurately by factoring in the sequence and nonsequence factors that significantly influence project duration and that capture the inherent uncertainties in the construction field. NN-LSTM fuses two characteristics of artificial neural networks (ANNs): feedforward neural networks (FNNs) for nonsequential issue, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential issue. After a systematic review of the literature, brainstorming, and in-depth interviews with domain experts, a database of 226 historical cases collected from 11 construction projects with 14 influencing factors was created for learning purposes, with 10-fold cross validation used to partition the training and testing data sets. NN-LSTM was then applied to estimate the schedule to completion for the historical cases, with FNN capturing the impact of time-independent factors on project duration and LSTM capturing the long temporal dependency for sequential inputs. The learning results indicated good performance, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 5% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2%, proving the NN-LSTM model to be more reliable than the currently prevailing earned value management (EVM) formulas. Moreover, in subsequent comparison testing NN-LSTM proved to be superior to other artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models. The model has the ability to generate reliable scheduling estimates for project managers in order to facilitate their accurate planning and the monitoring of the time performance of projects, allowing timely action to be taken to remedy foreseen delays and facilitating informed decision-making.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Chang, Yu-Han; Korir, Dorcas] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, 43 Keelung Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10607, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Chang, YH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, 43 Keelung Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10607, Taiwan.",myc@mail.ntust.edu.tw; D9705101@mail.ntust.edu.tw; dorcas.korir@yahoo.com,"Cheng, Min-Yuan/G-3510-2013","korir, dorcas/0000-0001-5457-3267",,,,,51,34,34,3,56,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Clinical public health can be defined as an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of clinical medicine and public health, whilst clinical global health is the practice of clinical public health with a special focus on health issue management in resource-limited settings and contexts, including the Global South. As such, clinical public and global health represent vital approaches, instrumental in (i) applying a community/population perspective to clinical practice as well as a clinical lens to community/population health, (ii) identifying health needs both at the individual and community/population levels, (iii) systematically addressing the determinants of health, including the social and structural ones, (iv) reaching the goals of population's health and well-being, especially of socially vulnerable, underserved communities, (v) better coordinating and integrating the delivery of healthcare provisions, (vi) strengthening health promotion, health protection, and health equity, and (vii) closing gender inequality and other (ethnic and socio-economic) disparities and gaps. Clinical public and global health are called to respond to the more pressing healthcare needs and challenges of our contemporary society, for which AI and BDA can help unlock new options and perspectives. In the aftermath of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the future trend of AI and BDA in the healthcare field will be devoted to building a more healthy, resilient society, able to face several challenges arising from globally networked hyper-risks, including ageing, multimorbidity, chronic disease accumulation, and climate change.","[Kong, Jude Dzevela; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Lab Ind & Appl Math LIAM, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Kong, Jude Dzevela; Akpudo, Ugochukwu Ejike; Effoduh, Jake Okechukwu; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] York Univ, Africa Canada Artificial Intelligence & Data Innov, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Kong, Jude Dzevela; Effoduh, Jake Okechukwu; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] York Univ, Global South Artificial Intelligence Pandem & Epid, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Kong, JD; Bragazzi, NL (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Lab Ind & Appl Math LIAM, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.;Kong, JD; Bragazzi, NL (corresponding author), York Univ, Africa Canada Artificial Intelligence & Data Innov, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.;Kong, JD; Bragazzi, NL (corresponding author), York Univ, Global South Artificial Intelligence Pandem & Epid, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",jdkong@yorku.ca; robertobragazzi@gmail.com,"Effoduh, Okechukwu/KHC-7706-2024; Bragazzi, Nicola/G-1672-2011; Akpudo, Ugochukwu/AAL-7448-2020","Kong, Jude/0000-0002-7557-5672; Effoduh, Okechukwu/0000-0001-9979-2594; Bragazzi, Nicola/0000-0001-8409-868X; Akpudo, Ugochukwu/0000-0003-4221-5192",Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [109981]; IDRC; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) [109559-001]; NSERC Discovery Grant [RGPIN-2022-04559]; NSERC Discovery Launch Supplement [DGECR-2022-00454]; New Frontier in Research Fund- Exploratory [NFRFE-2021-00879],Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC)(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); IDRC(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); NSERC Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC Discovery Launch Supplement(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); New Frontier in Research Fund- Exploratory,"This research is funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) (Grant No. 109981) (JDK and NLB).

To overcome this issue, most HPC facilities have added support for HPC friendly container technologies such as Shifter, Singularity, or Charliecloud. These different container technologies are all compatible with the more popular Docker containers, however the implementation and use of said containers is different for each HPC friendly container technology. These usage differences can make it difficult for an end user to easily submit and utilize different HPC sites without making adjustments to their workflows and software. This issue is exacerbated when attempting to utilize workflow management software between different sites with differing container technologies. The SCAILFIN project aims to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and likelihood-free inference (LFI) techniques and software using scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI) that span multiple sites. The project has extended the CERN-based REANA framework, a platform designed to enable analysis reusability, and reproducibility while supporting different workflow engine languages, in order to support submission to different HPC facilities. The work presented here focuses on the development of an abstraction layer that allows the support of different container technologies and different transfer protocols for files and directories between the HPC facility and the REANA cluster edge service from the user's workflow application.","[Anampa, Kenyi Hurtado; Kankel, Cody; Hildreth, Mike; Brenner, Paul; Johnson, Irena; Hampton, Scott] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Simko, Tibor] CERN, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Notre Dame; European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),"Anampa, KH (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",khurtado@nd.edu; ckankel@nd.edu; mhildret@nd.edu; pbrennel@nd.edu; ijohnso1@nd.edu; shampton@nd.edu; tibor.simko@cern.ch,"Anampa, Kenyi/GPX-8479-2022",,"National Science Foundation [OAC-1841456, OAC-1841471, OAC-1841448]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The SCAILFIN project is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (OAC-1841456, OAC-1841471, OAC-1841448).

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of nonoperative outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients. Methods: A standardized pathway for non-operative outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children (NOMA-C) was implemented in a university pediatric surgery practice starting October 2021. Those who met criteria would be considered for discharge from the emergency department (ED) with oral antibiotics and close followup over the following year. A quality improvement project started concurrently to monitor patients for recurrent symptoms of appendicitis. Results: A total of 121 patients were diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the study period (October 2021 to April 2023). Forty-five children (38%) met criteria for the NOMA-C protocol, and 11 patients/ families chose appendectomy. Of the 34 patients who pursued nonoperative management, 14 patients were admitted to the hospital and 20 patients were discharged from the ED. Total time in the ED/hospital was significantly shorter for patients discharged from the ED (7 hours versus 23 hours; p<0.001). At one year follow up only 4 (12%) had undergone appendectomy. There were no adverse events for patients who underwent nonoperative management. Conclusion: A protocol offering non-operative management of appendicitis with an option for outpatient management was feasible and safe. Outpatient management was associated with shorter ED/hospital stays than those admitted. Future studies should evaluate whether this protocol can be adopted by EDs without pediatric surgery services to avoid the need for transfer. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

The current proposal (ADLog) leverages log data of sources, which contain incomparably richer contextual information, and demonstrates a reliable way of discriminating application objects. Specifically, using native constructs of VMware Aria Operations for Logs in terms of event types and their distributions, we group those entities, which then can be potentially enriched with indicative tags automatically and recommended for further management tasks and policies. Our methods differentiate not only diverse kinds of applications, but also their specific deployments, thus providing hierarchical representation of the applications in time and topology. For several applications under Aria Ops management in our experimental test bed, we discover those in terms of similarity behavior of their components with a high accuracy.

To achieve this goal, an assistant, or interface agent according to the model proposed by Patti Maes [MK93], has been realized. The goal of the assistant is first to learn, by observation, the behavior of the network supervision operator and second to reproduce such a behavior when the conditions in which the behavior has been learned are detected again. The learned information are stored using chronicles [Gha94]. A chronicle is a data-structure allowing programmers to represent sequences of events while taking temporal knowledge into account.

In the wake of the pandemic, this sector must be prepared to make bold, innovative moves to prepare for the future. Over the past few years, the use of drones and robotics has expanded with many commercial uses, including in the construction industry. Drone-driven automation has an enormous impact in improving productivity and reducing cost and schedule overruns. The use of drones, along with the application of Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics, can make a significant impact on the supply chain and improve inventory accuracy, leading to faster and more cost-effective building projects. This paper will propose and statistically substantiate an optimization model for supply chain management through the accelerated use of drones and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the post-pandemic era. The use of smart devices and IoT will allow warehouse managers to have real-time visibility of the location and inventory tracking, as well as enabling warehouse workers to access information without being physically present. Cutting-edge drone technology can quickly perform inspections to make inventory control more economical and efficient. While they are certainly not a perfect fit for every building surveillance task, drones have many advantages for probing buildings in search of leaks, performing aerial surveys, and dealing with security issues more cost-effectively than manual procedures, thereby leading to improved communication and collaboration between different stakeholders.

However, the management and deployment of massive edge data centers bring new challenges for the current network. In this article, we propose a new edge-based IoT platform for AI (EBI-PAI), based on software-defined network (SDN) and serverless technology. EBI-PAI provides a unified service calling interface and schedules the resources automatically to satisfy the QoE requirements of users. To optimize performances during incremental deployment, we formulate the deployment problem, prove its complexity, and design heuristic algorithms to solve it. We implement EBI-PAI based on an opensource serverless project and deploy it in real networks. To evaluate EBI-PAI, we conduct comprehensive simulations based on the generated and real-world network topology, and real-world base station data set. The simulation results show that EBI-PAI can greatly improve QoE with the same budget and save the budget to achieve similar QoE. We finally carry out a case study with real user demands, and it further validates the simulation results.","[Yang, Shu; Xu, Kunkun; Cui, Laizhong; Ming, Zhongxing; Chen, Ziteng; Ming, Zhong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Cui, Laizhong] Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518066, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Peng Cheng Laboratory,"Cui, LZ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",cuilz@szu.edu.cn,"Ming, Zhongxing/AAC-4048-2020; Cui, Laizhong/AAX-9571-2020",,"National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2018YFB1800302, 2018YFB1800805]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772345, 61902258, 61672358, 61836005]; Major Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen [JCYJ20190808142207420, GJHZ20190822095416463]; Pearl River Young Scholars Funding of Shenzhen University",National Key Research and Development Plan of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen; Pearl River Young Scholars Funding of Shenzhen University,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Plan of China under Grant 2018YFB1800302 and Grant 2018YFB1800805; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772345, Grant 61902258, Grant 61672358, and Grant 61836005; in part by the Major Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20190808142207420 and Grant GJHZ20190822095416463; and in part by the Pearl River Young Scholars Funding of Shenzhen University.",,45,13,13,1,13,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,JUN 15,2021,8,12,,,,,9580,9593,,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019008,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,SN5UQ,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000658354800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study begins with a thorough literature search that examines the growth of AI in supply chain management (SCM) across several industries, including healthcare and e-commerce, in order to give a comprehensive background and contextualize the telecom sector's accomplishments with reference to AI. The methodology includes applying different machine learning models to predict customer turnover by meticulously pre-processing the data and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). In order to handle missing values, a hybrid technique using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputer for numerical features and Simple Imputer for categorical variables was used during the data preprocessing stage, which involves deleting duplicate entries and unnecessary columns. Through informative statistics and graphics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed important elements like rival offerings and the kind of internet service, thereby delivering insightful information regarding what causes churn. During the investigation, various machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, and XGBoost classifiers, were used. With an accuracy of 98.25%, Random Forest shows improved performance over the Decision Tree model, which had an accuracy of 98.02%. These models were tested using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. This approach emphasizes how important predictive analytics is to comprehending the dynamics of customer turnover and further lays the groundwork for tactical interventions meant to improve customer satisfaction and retention in the telecom industry.","[Afzal, Mohammad] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rahman, Shanur] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Disha] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Imran, Ale] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Zakir Husain Coll Engn Technol, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University; Aligarh Muslim University; Aligarh Muslim University; Zakir Husain College Of Engineering & Technology; Aligarh Muslim University,"Rahman, S (corresponding author), Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shanurrahman02@gmail.com,"Afzal, Mohammad/LDE-8761-2024",", Mohammad Afzal/0009-0007-4880-8198; IMRAN, ALE/0000-0003-0105-9736; RAHMAN, SHANUR/0009-0008-0909-6682",,,,,44,0,0,6,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,115256,115267,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3445281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3445281,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,E5K0C,,gold,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001303375800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, the manual monitoring processes traditionally employed are both time-consuming and costly. Safety managers often struggle with juggling diverse responsibilities beyond safety management, especially in large projects where there might be a shortage of personnel for effective on-site safety oversight. Thus, there is a necessity to integrate technological advancements that ensure real-time worker safety monitoring and alleviate the workload of on-site safety managers who oversee worker activities. The iSAFEGuard platform has been introduced to address this issue, incorporating cutting-edge technological monitoring innovations employing 127 unsafe scene detectors through Computer Vision (CV) technology. This platform has been developed to monitor and mitigate various risks, including falls, being caught in/between incidents, being struck by objects, electric shock occurrences, fires, etc. The advancement and application of techniques such as depth estimation, edge detection, and background subtraction in identifying these risks are discussed. Additionally, diverse applications of the iSAFEGuard platform on activities involving scaffolds, ladders, welding machinery, arrow saws, and others are explored. In conclusion, the iSAFEGuard platform presents an automated and technologically driven approach to safety management, enhancing the safety of construction workers and improving overall job site safety conditions.","[Soltani, Mehrtash; Pedro, Akeem; Yang, Jaehun; Zaidi, Syed Farhan Alam; Lee, Doyeop; Park, Chansik] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Soltani, M (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",soltani@cau.ac.kr,"Zaidi, Syed Farhan Alam/AAD-7720-2020",,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2022R1A2B5B02002553]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2020R1I1A1A01073167]; National R&D Project for Smart Construction Technology - Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport [23SMIP-A158708-04]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); National R&D Project for Smart Construction Technology - Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure & Transport (MOLIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. NRF-2022R1A2B5B02002553) and Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. NRF-2020R1I1A1A01073167).

Different types of flood have varying consequences and are followed by a specific pattern. For example, a flash flood can be a result of snow or ice melt and can occur in specific geographic places and certain season. The motivation behind this research has been raised from the Building Resilience into Risk Management (BRIM) project, looking at resilience in water systems. This research uses the application of the state-of-the-art techniques i.e., AI, more specifically Machin Learning (ML) approaches on big data, collected from previous flood events to learn from the past to extract patterns and information and understand flood behaviours in order to improve resilience, prevent damage, and save lives. In this paper, various ML models have been developed and evaluated for classifying floods, i.e., flash flood, lakeshore flood, etc. using current information i.e., weather forecast in different locations. The analytical results show that the Random Forest technique provides the highest accuracy of classification, followed by J48 decision tree and Lazy methods. The classification results can lead to better decision-making on what measures can be taken for prevention and preparedness and thus improve flood resilience.","[Saravi, Sara; Kalawsky, Roy; Joannou, Demetrios] Loughborough Univ, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Adv VR Res Ctr, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Casado, Monica Rivas] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Fu, Guangtao; Meng, Fanlin] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England",Loughborough University; Cranfield University; University of Exeter,"Saravi, S (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Adv VR Res Ctr, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",s.saravi@lboro.ac.uk; r.s.kalawsky@lboro.ac.uk; d.joannou@lboro.ac.uk; m.rivas-casado@cranfield.ac.uk; g.fu@exeter.ac.uk; m.fanlin@exeter.ac.uk,"Fu, Guangtao/ABE-3874-2021; Rivas Casado, Monica/N-4711-2015","Kalawsky, Roy/0000-0002-9023-8295; Joannou, Demetrios/0000-0002-1153-5989; Rivas Casado, Monica/0000-0002-4169-3099; Saravi, Sara/0000-0003-2226-0199",EPSRC [EP/N010329/1]; EPSRC [EP/N010329/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by the EPSRC for funding on BRIM (Building Resilience Into Risk Management), Ref: EP/N010329/1",,24,47,47,8,68,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,11,5,,,,,,,973,10.3390/w11050973,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11050973,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IE9FN,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000472680400103,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its complex diagnosis and assessment need ongoing monitoring, highlighting the potential use of digital assessment tools for enhancing patient management, even outside the clinical settings. In this vein, this paper proposes a smartphone-based video analysis approach for assessing motor skills, particularly balance and posture, in individuals diagnosed with PD. In particular, the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) ratings for items 3.8 (leg agility), 3.9 (arising from chair),3.13 (posture) and 3.10 (gait) are estimated by capturing and analysing video from PD patients, while performing a Comprehensive Motor Function Test. Specifically, a 3D pose landmark detection (skeleton extraction) model based on the the MediaPipe Machine Learning Platform is used and different motion features are estimated from the captured videos that may correlate with the MDS-UPDRS assessments provided by clinicians. A machine learning pipeline (evaluating five different ML classifiers) is then proposed to examine the feasibility of using these features for monitoring the balance and posture of PD patients. Experimental results, obtained using a cohort of 17 Greek PD patients, voluntarily participating in this study, demonstrate that certain features have significant correlation with the clinical MDS-UPDRS ratings. These promising results showcase the potentiality of digital assessment to provide objective representation of the PD patient's motor skills, supporting both PD clinical assessment and self-management. Ongoing work within the AI-PROGNOSIS project will further validate these findings within a larger cohort and from additional countries.","[Stergioulas, Andreas; Grammalidis, Nikos; Dimitropoulos, Kosmas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Informat Technol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Dias, Sofia Balula; Alves, Beatriz] Univ Lisbon, CIPER, Fac Motricidade Humana, Lisbon, Portugal; [al Hussein, Ghada] Univ Lisbon, Fac Motricidade Humana, Lisbon, Portugal; [al Hussein, Ghada] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Bostantjopoulou, Sevasti; Katsarou, Zoe; Dagklis, Ioannis] Papanikolaou Hosp, Neurol Clin 3, Thessaloniki, Greece",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Khalifa University of Science & Technology; George Papanikolaou General Hospital of Thessaloniki,"Stergioulas, A (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Informat Technol, Thessaloniki, Greece.",andrster@iti.gr; sbalula@fmh.ulisboa.pt; ft.beatriz.alves@gmail.com; Ghada.alhussein@ku.ac.ae; bostkamb@otenet.gr; katsarouzoe@gmail.com; gdag2005@yahoo.gr; ngramm@iti.gr; dimitrop@iti.gr,"Dagklis, Ioannis/X-8748-2019; Dias, Sofia B./P-3223-2018; Alves, Beatriz/F-2311-2014","Alhussein, Ghada/0000-0001-6181-8306; Dias, Sofia B./0000-0002-8239-583X; Alves, Beatriz/0009-0003-9127-2991; Alves, Beatriz/0000-0001-9930-7747; Dagklis, Ioannis/0000-0002-9120-2112",European Union [101080581],European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors would like to thank all PD patients who voluntarily participated in the study.

This study constitutes part of the user requirement definition of INCISIVE EU project. The project has been designed to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in cancer imaging to streamline diagnosis and management. The study aimed to map cancer care pathways (breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers) across INCISIVE partner countries, and identify bottle necks within these pathways. Methods: Email interviews were conducted with ten oncology specialised healthcare professionals representing INCISIVE partner countries: Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Finland, the United Kingdom (UK) and Serbia. A purposive sampling strategy was employed for recruitment and data was collected between December 2020 and April 2021. Data was entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to allow content examination and comparative analysis.Results: The analysed pathways all shared a common characteristic: inequalities in relation to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All the studied countries, except the UK, lacked official national data about diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Furthermore, a considerable variation was noted regarding the availability of imaging and diagnostic services across the seven countries. Several concerns were also noted for inefficiencies/in-equalities with regards to national screening for the four investigated cancer types. Conclusions: Delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment are an ongoing challenge and a source for inequalities. It is important to have systematic reporting of diagnostic and therapeutic delays in all countries to allow the proper estimation of its magnitude and support needed to address it. Our findings also support the orientation of the current policies towards early detection and wide scale adoption and implementation of cancer screening, through research, innovation, and technology. Technologies involving AI can have a great potential to revolutionise cancer care delivery.Policy summary: This study highlights the widespread delay in cancer diagnosis across Europe and supports the need for, systematic reporting of delays, improved availability of imaging services, and optimised national screening programs.

TiAssisto features telehealth and telemedicine solutions to enable high-quality standards treatments based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Three hundred patients are involved in our study: one half using our telehealth platform, while the other half participate as a control group for a correct validation. The developed AI models and the Decision Support System assist General Practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals in order to help them in their diagnosis, by providing suggestions and pointing out possible presence or absence of signs that can be related to pathologies.

This paper explores the potential of a digital twin as a transformative solution for engineer-to-order environments in manufacturing companies realizing prefabricated building components. This paper outlines a methodology encompassing users' requirements and the design to support the development of a digital twin that integrates Internet of Things devices, Building Information Modeling, and artificial intelligence capabilities. It delves into the specific challenges of outdoor warehouse optimization and worker safety within the context of engineer-to-order manufacturing, and how the digital twin aims to address these issues through data collection, analysis, and visualization. The research is conducted through an in-depth analysis of the warehouse of Focchi S.p.A., a leading manufacturer of high-tech prefabricated building envelopes. Focchi's production processes and stakeholder interactions are investigated, and the paper identifies key user groups and their multiple requirements for warehouse improvement. It also examines the potential of the digital twin to streamline communication, improve decision-making, and enhance safety protocols. While preliminary testing results are not yet available, the paper concludes by underlining the significant opportunities offered by a BIM-, IoT-, and AI-powered digital twin for engineer-to-order manufacturers. This research, developed within the IRIS project, serves as a promising model for integrating digital technologies into complex warehouse environments, paving the way for increased efficiency, safety, and ultimately, a competitive edge in the market of manufacturing companies working in the construction industry.","[Pracucci, Alessandro] Focchi SpA, Via Cornacchiara 805, I-47824 Poggio Torriana, Italy",,"Pracucci, A (corresponding author), Focchi SpA, Via Cornacchiara 805, I-47824 Poggio Torriana, Italy.",alessandropracucci@gmail.com,"Pracucci, Alessandro/JZU-0236-2024","Pracucci, Alessandro/0000-0003-0877-1283",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program within the framework of the Change2Twin (C2T) project's cascade fundings [951956]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [951956] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program within the framework of the Change2Twin (C2T) project's cascade fundings(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program within the framework of the Change2Twin (C2T) project's cascade fundings (grant agreement No 951956).,,44,1,1,24,31,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, malignancy can be reverted or cured using proper medication or surgery if the grade of malignancy is assessed properly. The assessment of correct grade is therefore critical in patient management as it can change the treatment decisions and prognosis for the dysplastic lesion. This assessment is highly challenging due to considerable inter- and intraobserver variability in pathologists' agreement, which highlights the need for an automated grading system that can predict more accurate and reliable grade. Recent advancements have made it possible for digital pathology (DP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to join forces from the digitization of tissue slides into images and using those images to train and predict more accurate grades using complex AI models. In this regard, we propose a novel morphometric approach exploiting the architectural features in dysplastic lesions i.e., irregular epithelial stratification where we measure the widths of different layers of the epithelium from the boundary layer i.e., keratin projecting inwards to the epithelium and basal layers to the rest of the tissue section from a clinically significant viewpoint.","[Bashir, R.

Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details. In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between IFC files throughout the design processes. A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers. Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models.","[Dawood, Huda; Dawood, Nashwan] Teesside Univ, SCEDD, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Siddle, Jonathan] Appl Integrat Ltd, Stokesley, England",University of Teesside,"Dawood, H (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, SCEDD, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England.",h.dawood@tees.ac.uk; jonathan.siddle@appliedintegration.co.uk; N.N.Dawood@tees.ac.uk,,"Dawood, Huda/0000-0003-1032-7560",Innovate UK,Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK),"This research was part of knowledge Transfer Partnerships with Applied Integration Limited and Teesside University, funded by Innovate UK.

Materials and Methods. Participants were 2,086 breast cancer survivors recruited through the Army of Women registry who were current tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) users. Participants reported whether they were bothered by each of 47 symptoms during the past month and whether they thought each symptom was related to taking ET. Frequencies of overall symptoms and symptoms attributed and misattributed to ET were calculated, and linear regression was used to assess sociodemographics, emotions, and illness perceptions as predictors of symptoms attributed to ET. Results. Women attributed a mean of 8.9 symptoms and misattributed a mean of 1.5 symptoms to ET. In the multivariable analysis, younger age, a more recent diagnosis, AI use (vs. tamoxifen), anxiety, depressive symptoms, more ET-related negative emotions, more concern about long-term ET use, and greater perceived ET necessity were independently associated with attribution of more symptoms to ET. More perceived ET necessity was associated with correctly attributing symptoms to ET, whereas higher depressive symptoms and more concern about ET use were associated with misattribution of symptoms to ET. Conclusion. Given that many women perceive a range of symptoms as a consequence of ET, attention to these symptoms may reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life, potentially improving ET adherence and optimizing survival.","[Rosenberg, Shoshana M.; Partridge, Ann H.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rosenberg, Shoshana M.; Partridge, Ann H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Stanton, Annette L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Johnsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Stanton, Annette L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Stanton, Annette L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Petrie, Keith J.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol Med, Auckland 1, New Zealand",Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Auckland,"Partridge, AH (corresponding author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ahpartridge@partners.org,,,NIH [5 R25 CA057711]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Breast Cancer Research Foundation,This work was supported by NIH Grant 5 R25 CA057711 (to S.M.R.) and by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (to A.L.S.).,,41,42,45,1,11,ALPHAMED PRESS,DURHAM,"318 BLACKWELL ST, STE 260, DURHAM, NC 27701-2884 USA",1083-7159,1549-490X,,ONCOLOGIST,Oncologist,JUN,2015,20,6,,,,,598,604,,10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0007,,,7,Oncology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oncology,CL1EC,25933930,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2025-03-21,WOS:000356684400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, end-to-end performance analysis and optimization will be key features in order to effectively manage the diverse requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries over the same shared infrastructure. To enable such a vision, the MARSAL project [ 1] targets the development and evaluation of a complete framework for the management and orchestration of network resources in 5G and beyond by utilizing a converged optical-wireless network infrastructure in the access and fronthaul/midhaul segments. At the network design domain, MARSAL targets the development of novel cell-free-based solutions. Namely, scalable and cost-efficient wireless access points deployment will be achieved by exploiting the distributed cell-free concept combined with wireless and wired serial fronthaul approaches. We will target the inclusion of these innovative functionalities in the O-RAN project. In parallel, in the fronthaul/midhaul segments MARSAL aims to radically increase the flexibility of optical access architectures for Beyond-5G cell site connectivity via different levels of fixed-mobile convergence. In the network and service management domain, the design philosophy of MARSAL is to provide a comprehensive framework for the management of the entire set of communication and computational network resources by exploiting novel ML-based algorithms of both edge and midhaul data centers, by incorporating the Virtual Elastic Data Centers/Infrastructures paradigm. Finally, at the network security domain, MARSAL aims to introduce mechanisms that provide privacy and security to application workload and data, targeting to allow applications and users to maintain control over their data when relying on the deployed shared infrastructures, while AI and Blockchain technologies will be developed in order to guarantee a secured multi-tenant slicing environment.","[Chochliouros, Ioannis P.; Kostopoulos, Alexandros] Hellen Telecommun Org OTE SA, 99 Kifissias Ave, Athens 15124, Greece; [Payaro, Miquel; Verikoukis, Christos] Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Barcelona, Spain; [di Vimercati, Sabrina De Capitani] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Vinogradov, Evgenii; Ranjbar, Vida] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Vardakas, John] Iquadrat Informat SL, Barcelona, Spain; [Rahman, Md Arifur] IS Wireless, Warsaw, Poland; [Soumplis, Polyzois; Varvarigos, Emmanuel] Inst Commun & Comp Syst ICCS, Athens, Greece",University of Milan; KU Leuven,"Kostopoulos, A (corresponding author), Hellen Telecommun Org OTE SA, 99 Kifissias Ave, Athens 15124, Greece.",alexkosto@oteresearch.gr,"Vinogradov, Evgenii/P-3107-2019; Rahman, Arifur/I-8296-2019","Vinogradov, Evgenii/0000-0002-4156-0317; Rahman, Md Arifur/0000-0003-3861-9290; Varvarigos, Emmanouel/0000-0002-4942-1362",EC [101017171],EC(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The paper has been based on the context of the MARSAL (Machine Learning-Based, Networking and Computing Infrastructure Resource Management of 5G and Beyond Intelligent Networks) Project, funded by the EC under the Grant Agreement (GA) No. 101017171.",,14,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1868-4238,1868-422X,978-3-030-79159-9; 978-3-030-79157-5; 978-3-030-79156-8,IFIP ADV INF COMM TE,,,2021,628,,,,,,85,94,,10.1007/978-3-030-79157-5_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79157-5_8,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BX4GD,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:001289290900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current research concentrates on advancing sustainable development practices by undertaking a comprehensive assessment of flood susceptibility in the Upper Vellar basin, with a projection for 2050. Employing an integrative methodology, this study utilizes an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Bivariate Analysis. Nine critical parameters were used: elevation, distance from the river, distance from the road, drainage density, predicted LULC, projected precipitation, slope, soil type, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). The Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSE) plugin, which uses Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN), was employed to predict the LULC map for the year 2050. Furthermore, bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP 6) EC EARTH 3 Model (GCM) RCP 4.5 and 8.5 projected precipitation data were employed. The resulting flood susceptibility zones are classified into three categories: low, moderate, and high, with proportions of 32.64%, 55.52%, and 11.84% for RCP 4.5, and 34.63%, 53.46%, and 11.91% for RCP 8.5, respectively, concerning the total area. In both scenarios, nearly 38% of the settlement area is at high flood risk. This study provides essential insights for policymakers and stakeholders, facilitating the formulation of sustainable strategies to address projected changes in land use, precipitation patterns, and flood susceptibility in the Upper Vellar region up to 2050.

Early prediction and personalization of treatment through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help clinicians and patients manage CVDs more effectively. However, to apply AI approaches to CVDs data, it is necessary to establish and curate a specialized database based on electronic health records (EHRs) and include pre-processed unstructured data.MethodsTo build a suitable database (CardioNet) for CVDs that can utilize AI technology, contributing to the overall care of patients with CVDs. First, we collected the anonymized records of 748,474 patients who had visited the Asan Medical Center (AMC) or Ulsan University Hospital (UUH) because of CVDs. Second, we set clinically plausible criteria to remove errors and duplication. Third, we integrated unstructured data such as readings of medical examinations with structured data sourced from EHRs to create the CardioNet. We subsequently performed natural language processing to structuralize the significant variables associated with CVDs because most results of the principal CVD-related medical examinations are free-text readings. Additionally, to ensure interoperability for convergent multi-center research, we standardized the data using several codes that correspond to the common data model. Finally, we created the descriptive table (i.e., dictionary of the CardioNet) to simplify access and utilization of data for clinicians and engineers and continuously validated the data to ensure reliability.ResultsCardioNet is a comprehensive database that can serve as a training set for AI models and assist in all aspects of clinical management of CVDs. It comprises information extracted from EHRs and results of readings of CVD-related digital tests. It consists of 27 tables, a code-master table, and a descriptive table.ConclusionsCardioNet database specialized in CVDs was established, with continuing data collection. We are actively supporting multi-center research, which may require further data processing, depending on the subject of the study. CardioNet will serve as the fundamental database for future CVD-related research projects.","[Ahn, Imjin; Na, Wonjun; Gwon, Hansle; Jeong, Yeon Uk; Kim, Yunha] Univ Ulsan, Asan Med Inst Convergence Sci & Technol, Dept Med Sci, Asan Med Ctr,Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Osung] Catholic Univ Korea, Eunpyeong St Marys Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Seoul, South Korea; [Yang, Dong Hyun] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Gyung-Min] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Ulsan Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Ulsan, South Korea; [Jun, Tae Joon] Asan Med Ctr, Asan Inst Life Sci, Big Data Res Ctr, 88,Olumpicro 43gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea; [Kang, Hee Jun; Yoo, Jungsun; Kim, Young-Hak] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Div Cardiol,Dept Internal Med, 88,Olumpicro 43gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea",University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center; Catholic University of Korea; University of Ulsan; Asan Medical Center; University of Ulsan; Ulsan University Hospital; University of Ulsan,"Jun, TJ (corresponding author), Asan Med Ctr, Asan Inst Life Sci, Big Data Res Ctr, 88,Olumpicro 43gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.;Kim, YH (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Asan Med Ctr, Div Cardiol,Dept Internal Med, 88,Olumpicro 43gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",taejoon@amc.seoul.kr; mdyhkim@amc.seoul.kr,"Park, M.J./Y-5611-2019; Kim, Young-Hoon/B-5332-2011",,"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP), Republic of Korea - Korea government (MSIT) [2017-0-00053]; Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute(KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [HR20C0026]","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP), Republic of Korea - Korea government (MSIT); Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute(KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea","This research was supported by the Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP), Republic of Korea grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2017-0-00053, A Technology Development of Artificial Intelligence Doctors for Cardiovascular Disease) and was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute(KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (Grant No. HR20C0026).

The system telemetry transmitted by these vehicles is crucial to understanding overall performance. A growing desire to implement greater levels of system autonomy and AI-enhanced control into these systems merits introducing rigorous safety analysis from formal methods techniques, such as Runtime Verification (RV). RV depends heavily upon the accuracy and robustness of the specifications it reasons over, and the task of developing a comprehensive set of system specifications often poses a significant challenge. To aid specification development for new systems, we provide an analysis on the process of implementing RV into four real aerospace systems of increasing complexity. We design and validate fourteen formal specifications for a real high-altitude balloon mission and draw on three past formal specification efforts on a sounding rocket, UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system, and CubeSat to compare specification patterns and overlapping system needs. We identify four common temporal logic subformulas for specifications within and between these systems, providing metrics on development resources, frequency, and perceived automation difficulty. We generalize our results and discuss considerations for automatically generating formal specifications in aerospace projects.","[Luppen, Zachary] Space Explorat Technol Corp, Hawthorne, CA 90250 USA; [Jacks, Michael; Baughman, Nathan; Stilic, Muhamed; Nasers, Ryan; Lee, Dae-Young; Rozier, Kristin Yvonne] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Hertz, Benjamin] Collins Aerosp, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498 USA; [Cutler, James] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Iowa State University; Raytheon Technologies; Collins Aerospace; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Luppen, Z (corresponding author), Space Explorat Technol Corp, Hawthorne, CA 90250 USA.",zachary.luppen@spacex.com,"Rozier, Kristin Yvonne/T-6708-2019; Lee, Dae Young/JCE-1255-2023","Baughman, Nathan/0000-0003-1217-2267; Cutler, James/0000-0002-6984-6851; Lee, David Daeyoung/0000-0002-6083-1805; Rozier, Kristin Yvonne/0000-0002-6718-2828; Luppen, Zachary/0000-0003-0704-843X",Iowa Space Grant Consortium under NASA [80NSSC20M0107]; NSF CAREER Award [CNS1552934]; NASA ECF [NNX16AR57G]; NSF PFI: BIC grant [CNS-1257011],Iowa Space Grant Consortium under NASA; NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NASA ECF; NSF PFI: BIC grant,"This project/material is based upon work supported by the Iowa Space Grant Consortium under NASA Award No. 80NSSC20M0107.

Adult patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) have historically been hospitalized and treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. However, over the last two decades, outpatient treatment of patients with acute DVT and low risk PE has become increasingly accepted as an effective and safe option for patients given the low risk of short-term clinical deterioration. The purpose of this project was to establish a transition of care (TCM) program for patients with acute VTE presenting to the ED. The primary goals for the project included better quality patient follow-up in the Vascular Medicine Nurse Practitioner (NP) within one week and medication adherence. The second goal was increasing appropriate ED discharges for patients with low-risk VTE. Outcome metrics include the rate of early discharge of low-risk patients with VTE, follow-up in the Vascular Medicine NP clinic, and anticoagulant adherence.

In addition, the importance of Off-Site Construction (OSC), a factory-based production method, is being highlighted as modular construction increases in the domestic construction market as a means of productivity enhancement. The problem with OSC construction is that the quality inspection of Precast Concrete (PC) members produced at the factory and brought to the construction site is not carried out accurately and systematically. Due to the shortage of quality inspection manpower, a lot of time and money is wasted on inspecting PC members on-site, compromising inspection efficiency and accuracy. In this study, the major inspection items to be checked during the quality inspection are classified based on the existing PC member quality inspection checklist and PC construction specifications. Based on the major inspection items, the items to which AI technology can be applied (for automatic quality inspection) were identified. Additionally, the research was conducted focusing on the detection of cracks, which are one of the major types of defects in PC members. However, accurate detection of cracks is difficult since the inspection mostly relies on a visual check coupled with subjective experience. To automate the detection of cracks for PC members, video images of cracks and non-cracks on the surface were collected and used for image training and recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and object detection, one of the deep learning technologies commonly applied in the field of image object recognition. Detected cracks were classified according to set thresholds (crack width and length), and finally, an automated PC member crack detection system that enables automatic crack detection based on mobile and web servers using deep learning and imaging technologies was proposed. This study is expected to enable more accurate and efficient on-site PC member quality inspection. Through the smart PC member quality inspection system proposed in this study, the time required for each phase of the existing PC member quality inspection work was reduced. This led to a reduction of 13 min of total work time, thereby improving work efficiency and convenience. Since quality inspection information can be stored and managed in the system database, human errors can be reduced while managing the quality of OSC work systematically and accurately. It is expected that through optimizing and upgrading our proposed system, quality work for the precise construction of OSC projects can be ensured. At the same time, systematic and accurate quality management of OSC projects is achievable through inspection data. In addition, the smart quality inspection system is expected to establish a smart work environment that enables efficient and accurate quality inspection practices if applied to various construction activities other than the OSC projects.","[Lee, Seojoon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Global Smart City, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Jeong, Minkyeong] HanmiGlobal, Dept High Tech Div, Seoul 06164, South Korea; [Cho, Chung-Suk] Khalifa Univ, Dept Civil Infrastruct & Environm Engn, POB 127788, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Park, Jaewon] SK Ecoplant, Business Grp, Smart Data Ctr, Seoul 03143, South Korea; [Kwon, Soonwook] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Civil Architectural Engn & Landscape Architec, Suwon 16419, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Khalifa University of Science & Technology; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, CS (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Dept Civil Infrastruct & Environm Engn, POB 127788, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.;Kwon, S (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Civil Architectural Engn & Landscape Architec, Suwon 16419, South Korea.",chung.cho@ku.ac.ae; swkwon@skku.edu,"Cho, Chung-Suk/P-7592-2016",,"Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA); Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) under the Innovative Talent Education Program for Smart City; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport [22ORPS-B158109-03]","Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)(Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA)); Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) under the Innovative Talent Education Program for Smart City; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure & Transport (MOLIT), Republic of Korea)","This work is supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by theMinistry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (Grant 22ORPS-B158109-03).

This calls for research on the integration and evaluation of ML development practices within software companies. To investigate these issues, we conducted expert interviews with software and ML professionals. We structured the interviews around information systems development (ISD) models, which serve as conceptual frameworks that guide stakeholders throughout software projects. Using practice theory, we analyzed how software professionals perceive ML development within the context of ISD models and identified themes that characterize the transformative impact of ML development on these conceptual models. Our findings show that developer -driven conceptual models, such as DevOps and MLOps, have been embraced as common frameworks for developers and management to understand and guide the ML development processes. We observed ongoing shifts in predefined developer roles, wherein developers are increasingly adopting ML techniques and tools in their professional work. Overall, our findings underscore that ML technologies are becoming increasingly prominent in software projects across industries, and that the incorporation of ML development in ISD models is an ongoing, largely practice -driven, process.","[Laato, Samuli; Minkkinen, Matti; Mantymaki, Matti] Univ Turku, Informat Syst Sci, Turku, Finland; [Laato, Samuli] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol Commun Sci, Tampere, Finland; [Dennehy, Denis] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Swansea, Wales",University of Turku; Tampere University; Swansea University,"Laato, S (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Informat Syst Sci, Turku, Finland.",,"Dennehy, Denis/AAA-6716-2022; Laato, Samuli/HLH-0161-2023; Minkkinen, Matti/T-7067-2019","Laato, Samuli/0000-0003-4285-0073; Mantymaki, Matti/0000-0002-1981-566X; Minkkinen, Matti/0000-0002-6406-8093",,,,,78,0,0,11,17,ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,ATLANTA,"GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA",1529-3181,,,COMMUN ASSOC INF SYS,Commun.

Intelligence amplification does not replace human decision makers but may help especially professionals in making complex decisions by well-designed human-AI system learning interactions (i.e., triple loop learning). To understand the adoption challenges of intelligence amplification systems, we analyse the adoption of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an organizational learning process by the case of a CDSS implementation for deciding on administering antibiotics to prematurely born babies. We identify user-oriented single and double loop learning processes, triple loop learning, and institutional deutero learning processes as organizational learning processes that must be realized for effective intelligence amplification adoption. We summarize these insights in a system dynamic model-containing knowledge stocks and their transformation processes-by which we analytically structure insights from the diverse studies of CDSS and intelligence amplification adoption and by which intelligence amplification projects are given an analytic theory for their design and management. From our case study, we find multiple challenges of deutero learning that influence the effectiveness of IA implementation learning as transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge back to tacit knowledge. In a discussion of implications, we generate further research directions and discuss the generalization of our case findings to different organizations.","[Wijnhoven, Fons] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, POB 217,7500, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Wijnhoven, F (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, POB 217,7500, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",a.b.j.m.wijnhoven@utwente.nl,"Wijnhoven, Fons/M-8010-2019; Wijnhoven, Fons/B-4960-2010","Wijnhoven, Fons/0000-0001-8231-7535",,,,,84,16,17,8,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

Many of those who died in recent years had at least one emergency department (ED) visit during pregnancy or the postpartum period. This suggests that with the proper training and education, EDs can play an important role in reducing maternal mortality. Methods: A Task Force of 33 interdisciplinary stakeholders from across Illinois met monthly over 1 year to gather and develop educational content focused on obstetric emergency medicine and produce the Maternal Health Emergency Department Toolkit (Toolkit) training. A survey and listening session collected stakeholders' feedback about factors that supported Toolkit development, barriers, and recommendations for similar projects. Results: The Task Force members adapted existing tools and developed novel resources to fill the gaps in maternal health education for the ED setting. The Toolkit consists of five educational modules including didactic information, case-based learning, and resources for additional reading and local implementation. The modules focus on ED recommendations from the Illinois Maternal Mortality Review Committees, triage and management of emergencies in perinatal patients, screening and treatment of mental health and substance use conditions, addressing trauma, performing resuscitation during pregnancy, and conducting safe and coordinated discharge of perinatal patients from the ED. Task Force members described the inclusion of experts with interdisciplinary knowledge, working in small groups, and grounding the educational content in maternal health data as factors contributing to the project's success. They identified scheduling conflicts as a challenge and recommended future projects like this one include more ED providers and staff members. Conclusion: Through promoting cross-disciplinary engagement, education, and collaboration with obstetrics and other service lines, the Toolkit can help fill the gaps in maternal ED education to decrease maternal mortality and morbidity in Illinois.

The current standard vulnerability tracking system relies mostly on human-driven efforts. Besides, open-source libraries do not necessarily follow the standards of vulnerability reporting set by CVE and NIST, but rather use Github issues for reporting. In this paper, we propose a framework, NL2Vul, to measure score of vulnerabilities with minimal human efforts. NL2VuI makes use of deep neural networks to train on descriptions of software vulnerabilities from NVD and predicts vulnerability scores. To flexibly expand the trained NVD model for different data sources that are being used to evaluate the risk posture in CSPM, NL2Vul uses transfer learning for quick re-training. We have evaluated NL2Vul with vanilla NVD, public Github issues of open source projects, and compliance technology specification documents.","[Bulut, Muhammed Fatih; Hwang, Jinho] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Ossining, NY 10562 USA",International Business Machines (IBM); IBM USA,"Bulut, MF (corresponding author), IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Ossining, NY 10562 USA.",mfbulut@us.ibm.com; jinho@us.ibm.com,"Bulut, Muhammed/GVS-9099-2022",,,,,,21,2,2,1,4,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2159-6182,,978-1-6654-0060-2,IEEE INT CONF CLOUD,,,2021,,,,,,,566,571,,10.1109/CLOUD53861.2021.00073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD53861.2021.00073,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS6LG,,,,,2025-03-21,WOS:000749430800061,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this transformed landscape, the evolution of the construction management paradigm carefully considers the enhancement of business models and organizational structures to prioritize stakeholders' well-being, environmental sustainability, and heightened resilience. A significant challenge lies in effectively managing and coordinating a myriad of multi-source and heterogeneous entities using information and automation technologies. The key obstacle is synchronizing these elements based on cyber-physical interoperation to optimize multiple objectives seamlessly. Hence synchronization emerges as a crucial factor for orchestrating and sustaining harmonious relationships among multiple entities or activities within a delimited spatial-temporal framework. This ensures seamless and aligned coordination throughout dynamic processes. Therefore, this paper presents a strategic roadmap for the synchronized construction management, derived from a thorough analysis of fundamental elements in Construction 4.0, aimed at advancing the current construction management practices. Moreover, to articulate this synchronization approach systematically, an Orthogonally Synchronized Digital Twin (SDT) model with regular expression is formulated, built upon the proposed roadmap for reshaped construction management. This study provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the construction industry, including architects, engineers, project managers, and policymakers. The findings guide decision-making on digital twin adoption in construction, supporting practitioners to enhance efficiency and improve outcomes, offering a roadmap for industry advancement towards human-centrality, sustainability, and resilience. Future research should focus on validating the proposed roadmap and SDT model in real-world scenarios, exploring synergies between AI and digital twins, and investigating advanced technologies for holistic smart cities management.","[Jiang, Yishuo; Su, Shuaiming; Zhao, Shuxuan; Zhong, Ray Y.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yishuo] Cornell Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Ithaca, NY USA; [Qiu, Waishan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD USA; [Brilakis, Ioannis] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England; [Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Cornell University; University of Hong Kong; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Cambridge; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zhong, RY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zhongzry@hku.hk,"Qiu, Waishan/ADD-3515-2022; zhao, shuxuan/KFA-7188-2024; SU, SHUAIMING/GQP-9110-2022; Brilakis, Ioannis/H-5369-2013","Brilakis, Ioannis/0000-0003-1829-2083","Guangdong Special Support Talent Program-Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leading Team [2019BT02S593]; HKU Teaching Development Grant (TDG) Award [951]; RGC Research Impact Fund [R7036-22, R7027-18]; RGC Theme-based Research Scheme [T32-707-22-N]; RGC GRF project [17202124]",Guangdong Special Support Talent Program-Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leading Team; HKU Teaching Development Grant (TDG) Award; RGC Research Impact Fund; RGC Theme-based Research Scheme; RGC GRF project,"This work was supported by Guangdong Special Support Talent Program-Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leading Team (2019BT02S593), HKU Teaching Development Grant (TDG) Award (Project No. 951), RGC Research Impact Fund (R7036-22), RGC Research Impact Fund No. R7027-18, RGC Theme-based Research Scheme (T32-707-22-N), and RGC GRF project (17202124).",,125,3,3,35,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2666-1659,,DEV BUILT ENVIRON,Dev.

In geotechnical engineering, various types of information technology, such as geographical information system (GIS), artificial intelligence (AI), and numerical simulation, are now being actively used to predict, visualize, and analyze physical parameters. In this paper, the recent development in integration of IT into geotechnical engineering fields are presented with emphasis on the use of GIS in tunnelling risk management. A combined technique that couples the artificial neural network (ANN) and the GIS is then presented. The proposed approach involves the development of ANN(s) using a calibrated finite element model(s) for use as a prediction tool and implementation of the developed ANN(s) into a GIS platform for visualization and analysis of spatial distribution of predicted results. A novel feature of the proposed approach is an ability to expedite a routine geotechnical design process that otherwise require significant time and effort in performing numerical analyses for different design scenarios. Two illustrative examples in which the developed approach was implemented are given; one for an urban tunnelling design project and the other for a soft ground improvement design project. It is shown that the proposed approach can be an efficient and robust decision making tool for routine geotechnical design works.

Institutions and instructors are continuously looking for alternatives to reduce educators' time required on grading, frequently, resulting in hiring teaching assistants whose inexperience and frequent rotation can lead to inconsistent and subjective evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 may alleviate grading challenges; however, research in this field is limited when dealing with assignments requiring specialized knowledge, complex critical thinking, subjective, and creative. This research investigates whether GPT-4's scores correlate with human grading in a construction capstone project and how the use of criteria and rubrics in GPT influences this correlation. Projects were graded by two human graders and three training configurations in GPT-4: no detailed criteria, paraphrased criteria, and explicit rubrics. Each configuration was tested through 10 iterations to evaluate GPT consistency. Results challenge GPT-4's potential to grade argumentative assignments. GPT-4's score correlates slightly better (although poor overall) with human evaluations when no additional information is provided, underscoring the poor impact of the specificity of training materials for GPT scoring in this type of assignment. Despite the LLMs' promises, their limitations include variability in consistency and reliance on statistical pattern analysis, which can lead to misleading evaluations along with privacy concerns when handling sensitive student data. Educators must carefully design grading guidelines to harness the full potential of LLMs in academic assessments, balancing AI's efficiency with the need for nuanced human judgment.","[Castelblanco, Gabriel; Yang, Zhenlin] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Cruz-Castro, Laura] Univ Florida, Dept Engn Educ, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Castelblanco, G (corresponding author), Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",gabriel.castelbl@ufl.edu,"Cruz Castro, Laura Melissa/HNB-6136-2023; Castelblanco, Gabriel/AFV-2294-2022","Castelblanco, Gabriel/0000-0001-6820-6644; Cruz Castro, Laura Melissa/0000-0002-9331-090X",,,,,35,0,0,14,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

Many studies have identified the causal factors of construction site quality failures and their cost impacts. However, limited studies have been made evaluating the domino effects of these on one another and the correlation between the cost impact and frequency of each attribute. In this study, made in the context of ongoing research into related artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models, a total of 2,527 nonconformance reports (NCRs) collected from 59 construction projects within the scope of a previous study were analyzed using the Delphi method and logistic regression analysis. According to the Delphi results, 25 critical cost impact factors were refined and categorized into five main groups: Materials, Design, Installation, Operation, and Process. Then, five main hypotheses were developed to test each attribute's cost impact and interaction by logistic regression. The results showed that although some attributes (from the Materials and Operation groups) have a significant impact on the cost of quality if observed in a failure report individually, others may become a critical cost-impact factor when interacting with other attributes. No significant correlation was observed between the frequency and cost impact of the attributes. Finally, a holistically based quality control system that considers the domino effects of causal factors from planning to operation was proposed for construction practitioners to reduce quality failures causing cost and time overruns.","[Kazar, Gokhan] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34310 Istanbul, Turkey; [Dogan, Neset Berkay; Ayhan, Bilal Umut] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Tokdemir, Onur Behzat] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Gelisim University; Middle East Technical University; Istanbul Technical University,"Tokdemir, OB (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.",kazargokhan88@gmail.com; berkay.dogan@metu.edu.tr; ayhan.umut@metu.edu.tr; otokdemir@itu.edu.tr,"KAZAR, GOKHAN/LOR-1007-2024; Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/O-4718-2016","Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/0000-0002-4101-8560",,,,,35,13,14,3,44,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The project leverages Safe-by-Design (SbD) principles to ensure the development of inherently safer NMs, enhancing both regulatory compliance and international collaboration. By building on established nanoinformatics frameworks, such as those developed in the H2020- funded projects NanoSolveIT and NanoCommons, CompSafeNano addresses critical challenges in nanosafety through development and integration of innovative methodologies, including advanced in vitro models, in silico approaches including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive models and 1st- principles computational modelling of NMs properties, interactions and effects on living systems. Significant progress has been made in generating atomistic and quantum-mechanical descriptors for various NMs, evaluating their interactions with biological systems (from small molecules or metabolites, to proteins, cells, organisms, animals, humans and ecosystems), and in developing predictive models for NMs risk assessment. The CompSafeNano project has also focused on implementing and further standardising data reporting templates and enhancing data management practices, ensuring adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Despite challenges, such as limited regulatory acceptance of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) currently, which has implications for predictive nanosafety assessment, CompSafeNano has successfully developed tools and models that are integral to the safety evaluation of NMs, and that enable the extensive datasets on NMs safety to be utilised for the re-design of NMs that are inherently safer, including through prediction of the acquired biomolecule coronas which provide the biological or environmental identities to NMs, promoting their sustainable use in diverse applications. Future efforts will concentrate on further refining these models, expanding the NanoPharos Database, and working with regulatory stakeholders thereby fostering the widespread adoption of SbD practices across the nanotechnology sector. CompSafeNano's integrative approach, multidisciplinary collaboration and extensive stakeholder engagement, position the project as a critical driver of innovation in NMs SbD methodologies and in the development and implementation of computational nanosafety.","[Zouraris, Dimitrios; Mavrogiorgis, Angelos; Tsoumanis, Andreas; Afantitis, Antreas] NovaMechanics Ltd, CY-1070 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Zouraris, Dimitrios; Lynch, Iseult; Afantitis, Antreas] Entelos Inst, CY-6059 Larnax, Cyprus; [Tsoumanis, Andreas; Afantitis, Antreas] NovaMech MIKE, Piraeus 18545, Greece; [Saarimaki, Laura Aliisa; del Giudice, Giusy; Federico, Antonio; Serra, Angela; Greco, Dario] Tampere Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Technol, Finnish Hub Dev & Validat Integrated Approaches FH, Tampere 33520, Finland; [Rouse, Ian; Subbotina, Julia; Lobaskin, Vladimir] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland; [Jagiello, Karolina; Ciura, Krzesimir; Judzinska, Beata; Mikolajczyk, Alicja; Sosnowska, Anita; Puzyn, Tomasz] QSAR Lab, Trzy Lipy 3, PL-80172 Gdansk, Poland; [Jagiello, Karolina; Ciura, Krzesimir; Judzinska, Beata; Mikolajczyk, Alicja; Sosnowska, Anita; Puzyn, Tomasz] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Gulumian, Mary; Wepener, Victor] North West Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Water Res Grp, Potchefstroom, North West Prov, South Africa; [Martinez, Diego S.

The Pandora project has developed an advanced smart environment for the training of Gold Commanders which uses AI planning techniques to provide a crisis scenario modelled as an event network. This includes points of decision for trainees managed by automated rules from a knowledge base, behavioural modelling of the trainees, and ambient management of the environment to provide affective inputs to control and manage trainee stress. In this context, the system controls and reacts to trainee performance in relation to the events and decision points and can dynamically remodel and reconfigure the event network to respond appropriately to trainee decisions. Trainees can also be pressurised through compression of the timelines or ambient management of the multimedia information presented within the environment, causing them to make decisions under stress or with inadequate information. The environment can also represent any missing trainees within the scenario, which provides the potential to offer a completely autonomous facility for scenario design and test, and potentially a decision support facility, based on a build-up of empirical evidence from real world and training situations. In summary, the Pandora system integrates its computational intelligence, with the intelligence of the trainer and the trainees, to provide an emotionally engaging, augmented reality/virtual reality training environment for crisis managers.","[Bacon, L.; MacKinnon, L.] Univ Greenwich, Sch Comp & Math Sci, London SE18 6PF, England; [Cesta, A.; Cortellessa, G.] Consiglio Nazl Ric CNR ISTC, Rome, Italy",University of Greenwich; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione (ISTC-CNR),"Bacon, L (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Sch Comp & Math Sci, London SE18 6PF, England.",e.bacon@gre.ac.uk; l.mackinnon@gre.ac.uk; amedeo.cesta@istc.cnr.it; gabriella.cortellessa@istc.cnr.it,"Cesta, Amedeo/ABD-3638-2020; Cesta, Amedeo/B-7430-2015","Cesta, Amedeo/0000-0002-0703-9122; Cortellessa, Gabriella/0000-0002-9835-1575","EU [FP7-ICT-SEC-2007-1, 225387]",EU(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to thank colleagues from the other partners in the PANDORA project for their contributions to the work presented, those partners being CEFRIEL (Italy), XLAB (Slovenia), FUB (Italy), UEL (UK), ORT (France) and EPC (UK).

The prognosis is excellent for localized forms, but the survival rates drop significantly when cancer invades the smooth muscle of the bladder. Imaging is essential for the accurate staging, prognosis, and assessment of therapeutic efficacy in bladder cancer and has the potential to guide personalized treatment strategies. Computed tomography has traditionally been the standard modality, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the emerging technique of choice for its superior soft tissue contrast without exposure to ionizing radiation. Multiparametric (mp)MRI provides physiological data interrogating the biology of the tumor, as well as high-resolution anatomical images. Advanced MRI techniques have enabled new imaging-based clinical endpoints, including novel scoring systems for tumor staging. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential for the automated discovery of clinically relevant patterns in mpMRI images of the bladder.Abstract This review focuses on the principles, applications, and performance of mpMRI for bladder imaging. Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) derived from mpMRI are increasingly used in oncological applications, including tumor staging, prognosis, and assessment of treatment response. To standardize mpMRI acquisition and interpretation, an expert panel developed the Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS). Many studies confirm the standardization and high degree of inter-reader agreement to discriminate muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer, supporting VI-RADS implementation in routine clinical practice. The standard MRI sequences for VI-RADS scoring are anatomical imaging, including T2w images, and physiological imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Physiological QIBs derived from analysis of DW- and DCE-MRI data and radiomic image features extracted from mpMRI images play an important role in bladder cancer. The current development of AI tools for analyzing mpMRI data and their potential impact on bladder imaging are surveyed. AI architectures are often implemented based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focusing on narrow/specific tasks. The application of AI can substantially impact bladder imaging clinical workflows; for example, manual tumor segmentation, which demands high time commitment and has inter-reader variability, can be replaced by an autosegmentation tool. The use of mpMRI and AI is projected to drive the field toward the personalized management of bladder cancer patients.","[Akin, Oguz; Shukla-Dave, Amita] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Radiol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lema-Dopico, Alfonso; Paudyal, Ramesh; Konar, Amaresha Shridhar; Schwartz, Lawrence H.; Shukla-Dave, Amita] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med Phys, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Chenevert, Thomas L.; Malyarenko, Dariya; Hadjiiski, Lubomir] Univ Michigan, Dept Radiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Al-Ahmadie, Hikmat] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Goh, Alvin C.; Bochner, Bernard] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rosenberg, Jonathan] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA",Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,"Shukla-Dave, A (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Radiol, New York, NY 10065 USA.;Shukla-Dave, A (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med Phys, New York, NY 10065 USA.",davea@mskcc.org,"Rosenberg, Jonathan/JOZ-9416-2023","Malyarenko, Dariya/0000-0003-0403-1501; Paudyal, Ramesh/0000-0003-0302-211X",NIH/NCI Cancer Center,NIH/NCI Cancer Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),The authors thank Aditya Apte and Yuki Arita for fruitful discussions and feedback.

GDM can cause severe perinatal complications for both mother and baby. Weight management through healthy diet and physical activity are key factors in decreasing risk for GDM. However, there are barriers to healthful eating in many AI/AN communities. Food insecurity, defined as the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life, is a risk factor for unwanted weight gain. Living in a food insecure household during preconception and pregnancy may increase risk of greater weight gain. In this paper, we examined the relationship between food insecurity with healthy eating self-efficacy and behaviors among AI/AN adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (n = 149) through secondary analysis of an existing randomized controlled trial dataset. This study offers unique insight regarding upstream causes of GDM health disparities among AI/AN communities. Food security had some moderating effects on individual eating behaviors. Additionally, both healthy eating behavior and self-efficacy for healthy eating improved more among the AYA who experienced food insecurity at baseline. Given the intergenerational implications of GDM, it is prudent that the healthcare sector works with AI/AN communities to support healthful eating behaviors and environments to decrease GDM disparities. Limited access to healthful food (e.g., food insecurity) is a social determinant of health that impacts gestational diabetes risk and related disparities for American Indian and Alaska Native females. American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are disproportionately impacted by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), subsequent type 2 diabetes, and food insecurity. It is prudent to decrease risk of GDM prior to pregnancy to decrease the intergenerational cycle of diabetes in AI/AN communities. The purpose of this project is to describe and examine food insecurity, healthy eating self-efficacy, and healthy eating behaviors among AI/AN females (12-24 years old) as related to GDM risk reduction. Methods included: secondary analysis of healthy eating self-efficacy and behaviors, and household-level food insecurity measures from an randomized controlled trial that tested the effect of engagement in a GDM risk reduction educational intervention on knowledge, behavior, and self-efficacy for GDM risk reduction from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Participants were AI/AN daughters (12-24 years old) and their mothers (N = 149 dyads). Researchers found that more than one-third (38.1%) reported food insecurity. At baseline food insecurity was associated with higher levels of eating vegetables and fruit for the full sample (p = .045) and cohabitating dyads (p = .002). By 3 months healthy eating self-efficacy (p = .048) and limiting snacking between meals (p = .031) improved more in the control group than the intervention group only for cohabitating dyads. For the full sample, the intervention group had increases in times eating vegetables (p = .022) and fruit (p = .015), whereas the control group had declines. In the full sample, food insecurity did not moderate the group by time interaction for self-efficacy for healthy eating (p & GE; .05) but did moderate the group by time interaction for times drinking soda (p = .004) and days eating breakfast (p = .013). For cohabitating dyads, food insecurity did moderate self-efficacy for eating 3 meals a day (p = .024) and days eating breakfast (p = .012). These results suggest food insecurity is an important factor regarding the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce GDM risk and offer unique insight on upstream causes of GDM health disparities among AI/AN communities.","[Stotz, Sarah A.; Moore, Kelly R.] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Ctr Amer Indian & Alaska Native Hlth, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Hebert, Luciana E.] Washington State Univ, Inst Res & Educ Adv Community Hlth IREACH, Elson S Floyd Coll Med, Seattle, WA USA; [Charron-Prochownik, Denise; Sereika, Susan M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hlth Promot & Dev, Sch Nursing, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Scarton, Lisa] Univ Florida, Sch Nursing, Dept Family, Community & Hlth Syst Sci, Gainesville, FL USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Colorado School of Public Health; Washington State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Stotz, SA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Ctr Amer Indian & Alaska Native Hlth, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",sarah.stotz@cuanschutz.edu,"Hebert, Luciana/KBB-3147-2024","Stotz, Sarah/0000-0003-4107-3313",Stopping GDM Study Group,Stopping GDM Study Group,"Acknowledgments The Stopping GDM Study Group includes: A.

There is a strong organizational perspective towards expert systems development in these banking organizations rather than the technical perspective. ES diffusion and top management commitment are closely associated The existence of IT strategy aligned with business strategy (and/or with an AI element within it) is not a good predictor for ES adoptions. Three cases of expert systems applications in banking are given in the paper These results are useful for practitioners in managing their intelligent systems projects and researchers for further studies in this area.

Strong privacy management programs and accountability mechanisms build trust with consumers. In the public sector, privacy regulators have seen massive information sharing projects fail when public input or consultation, or independent oversight is not considered. After a sequence of events in 2018, society as a whole began asking questions about what is being done with personal information and questioned whether it is in our best interests. This presentation made at the University of Alberta's Kule Institute's event on AI, Ethics and Society in May 2019 provides an overview of the shifts that have taken place and how privacy regulators internationally have incorporated discussions about ethical assessments, in addition to traditional privacy impact assessments, as a way to guide current and future tech developments involving personal information in a way that is legal, fair and just.","[Clayton, Jill; Sibbald, Scott] Off Informat & Privacy Commissioner Alberta, 410,9925-109 St, Edmonton, AB T5K 2J8, Canada",,"Clayton, J (corresponding author), Off Informat & Privacy Commissioner Alberta, 410,9925-109 St, Edmonton, AB T5K 2J8, Canada.",jclayton@oipc.ab.ca; ssibbald@oipc.ab.ca,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,7,INT CENTER INFORMATION ETHICS,KARLSRUHE,"C/O RAFEL CAPURRO, EIC, REDTENBACHERSTR 9, KARLSRUHE, 76133, GERMANY",1614-1687,,,INT REV INF ETHICS,Int.
